Feb 14 2024,negative,fifty shades of grey is one of if not the most unpleasant films ive ever watched with its story and writing are cheap and lazy especially the main characters have 0 chemistry because all they do is just talk have sex and thats it this movie has a cherry on top with one of the worst endings i ever had to endre
Feb 11 2024,negative,mr grey starts off strong and temporarily convinces you hes a strong powerful se oops sorry powerful man but poor ana being the romantic she is really breaks him down and bores the audience in the meantime youre bluelipped the entire film which is a let down considering you go in expecting a lot just disappointing because miss johnson bares all for a film that turned us all off wait that all of us turned off we werent looking for existential we were looking for existouch me

Oct 5 2023,positive,this trilogy sets a high standard for bnd intrigue fashion friendships dakota johnson is again gorgeous and the sexual dynamic between the main characters is hot convincing plot nope but thats not the point consensual bnd sexual exploration is rarely this well done
Sep 14 2023,positive,i expected it to be awful bit was pleasantly surprised romcom mills and boon style with a few whips and light spanking but actually the sex scenes were better more convincing more realistic more romantic and less embarrassing than most films and were actually part of the plot i enjoyed the romance and passion of the film
Sep 10 2023,positive,the flic trilogy is far superior to the novel dakota johnson is superb bnd is not for everyone granted but for those sexual creatives who bend social mores w agreement the visuals in this trio are unique and instructive rotten tom rating got this one wrong
Sep 8 2023,positive,reminds me of wattpad its okay
Sep 4 2023,negative,i saw a little bit of 50 shades of gray i scenes got me uncomfortable is when jamie dormen was whipping dakota johnson 6 times that got me uncomfortable   you know he lucky dakota johnson dad don johnson did not lawsuit give not take him court or el james sue her for bdsm activity don johnson did not make a scene in front mr dormen family
Aug 30 2023,negative,the only erason it gets 15 even is because the first 30 minutes is actually shot well and makes sense if it wasnt for that this would get a 0 possibly the editing and pacing go off the rails in the second half as this devolves in nothing but incoherent choices that characters make with no rhyme or reason and this becomes a porn flick effectively and the worst part is the sex scenes are so boring half the time and drag out once youve seen one sex scene with them youve seen them all and it makes the next 67 times just repetitive and because you cant show any actual penetration or real xxx rated stuff it becomes pointless to watch to a certain extent they either needed to go even more crazy and racy or make serious changes to the source material for a film they didnt do either and we get a boring incoherent porno effectively the cinemaotgraphy is well shot and framed most of the time but the problem is the characters are boirng the scenes themselves make no sense and the sex scenes which is half the film are dimly lit so you cant see most of it half the time and its boring to look at this movies plot is almost like a r rated lifetime movie the acting also is not that good because thye have no chemistry and the choices they make make no sense the contract felt completely pointless there is basically no story at all in the second half and they just have sex constantly for unclearstupid reasons the dialouge is terrible at times and comes out of nowhere and gets a good laugh uninetnetionally as well i didnt expect this to be so boring on top of so incoherent stay away from this at all costs
Aug 20 2023,negative,this movie has been out for a few years and ive just had the displeasure of watching it this movie has bad acting bad haircuts and a dumb plot there being 2 more movies after this completely baffles me i wont be watching them this movie was only popular because middleaged women unfortunately get horny not because it was good the muppet movie over this monstrosity any day
Aug 20 2023,positive,just recently watched this for the first time and im not sure why the ratings are so low i thought it was a good movie with a good soundtrack to match the only reason i didnt rate it higher was due to a cringy piece of dialogue that i couldve done without
Aug 10 2023,negative,you know those movies where you say i have nothing else to watch it cant be that bad well it is no chemistry at all with the leads its laughable to see they do acts that would require such passion like swooping in for a rapturous kiss in an elevator but youre left with the thought there is no way that would happen sorry     the dude is not my cup of tea i find it hard to watch when the cast have lines that he is so hot when hes just not i think most everyone can agree brad pitt is a nice looking man even if hes not your type cant say that for this dude his acting just didnt seem to fit the part i did not believe he was this billionaire people cave to     dakota not ravishing in my eyes shes rather plain nice eyes tho then lines from cast that she must fight guys off with a stick come on she doesnt look like shes in college i dont buy either of them being smitten by each other she might be because of his money but him for her nah    i think this could have been a lot more intriguing like they did with basic instinct that movie was captivating this was not    and a romance um if this is romance then ill stick with a table for one please
Jul 5 2023,negative,a film that is basically porn with very little story
Jun 21 2023,positive,i loved this move and the next 2 i dont know how it got such low rotten tomatoes and audience score ive even bought them and i watched them all the time its one of those movies that you can watch over and over and over and never get bored of and imagine you are anastasia steele 
Jun 11 2023,positive,many people are laughing at christian grey and the whole movie but i think this is actually a good movie if you wanna see something adult erotic and sexy i think the first part is the best part just because it has a story which was back then really new to the world and confusing it brings the whole bdsm things closer to the person who watches the movie it shows the feelings of anastasia and shows how confusing love can be if youre a lovestory fan but you dont like kitsch movies it would be perfect its cause love and an erotic story with much more than just sex i think the book is better but even the trailer caught me i think everyone should at least try to see this movie and how ive said for all young adults its the perfect movie
May 25 2023,negative,my wife insisted to watch the movie with me i last 20 minutes and then i go watch some funny cats videos in yt
May 18 2023,positive,just finished rewatching fifty shades and i have to call it one of the better romances ive seen and not because of the sex although it does contribute to the plot this film is a dakota johnson movie through and through jamie dornan is a prop for dakota who owns every scene it is the alleged submissive anastasia steele who truly owns this relationship christian grey is nothing more than an effd up horndog who thinks hes a dominant by the end we see it was anastasia who had the power all along
May 8 2023,negative,fifty shades of grey is one of if not the most unpleasant films ive ever watched with its story and writing are cheap and lazy especially the main characters have 0 chemistry because all they do is just talk have sex and thats it this movie has a cherry on top with one of the worst endings i ever had to endre
Apr 26 2023,positive,this movie is fine for the people its intended for the cast has no chemistry though and it appears that is 99 on johnson
Apr 7 2023,negative,a slog to watch but useful as a public service documentary on how not to be a dom
Mar 29 2023,positive,well lots of people enjoy a little kinkiness in sex which is why it is unfortunate that this film kind of botches up the fun
Feb 19 2023,positive,this is my favorite romantic film
Feb 16 2023,negative,for the love of all that is holy if you ever encounter a man who exhibits any of the behaviors that christian displays run run fast and run far as the adage goes if this movie did not take place in a mansion but a run down trailer park it would make a terrifying thriller
Feb 13 2023,negative,forgive me lord for what i had watched
Feb 12 2023,positive,i have read many mens reviews of this film and as expected they miss the boat on an incredible love story that happens throughout the three booksmovies yes of course theres sex in them and that was the main draw for many people but i believe that made many overlook the underlying story of both christian and anastasia from the time anna stumbled into christians office they were on a collision course christian leaving his sadistic life and anna leaving her life of virginity both being drawn to each other where in book threemovie three they meet in a life of intimacy and companionship every relationship has ups and downs and theirs had its fair share as well but thats what dramas are about conflict and resolution  that is what happened during the course of these books anna grew from a naive girl to an educated and assertive woman and christian from a sadist to a father allinall a great love story
Jan 30 2023,positive,insightful movie exemplifying how sexual misprogramming in childhood may carry forward into adult life
Jan 21 2023,positive,i must have been living under a rock when these movies came out but after seeing the first one on tv i was hooked iv bought the books and the dvd trilogy and iv watched them more than once i love the story line and dakota johnson is a natural beauty and a very good actress she played the part very well as for jamie dornan omg what a good looking guy and he can act too i can see lots of good parts coming their way too bad they didnt get paid more
Jan 4 2023,negative,considering the subject matter its hard to figure out why a movie like fifty shades of grey is so painfully drab  when anastasia dakota johnson a recent college graduate crosses paths with wealthy businessman christian jamie dornan sparks fly  before she knows it the sexually inexperienced anastasia finds herself in an allconsuming relationship generally bound and blindfolded with the controlling christian  the main problems with the movie would seem to be the incredibly dull dialogue little of which feels natural and none of which is the least bit interesting and the drabness of the characters  while johnson at least seems engaged in her character and gives it the old college try dornan attacks his role with the enthusiasm and energy of a garden slug moping about in what appears to be a constant state of boredom  other than johnson writhing around in a blissful state theres not much to see here
Jan 1 2023,positive,any criticism on the morality of the story should be directed at the book not on the movie    very beautiful movie beautiful acting and direction
Dec 14 2022,negative,didnt like the movie that much its a different kind of relationship submissive relationships seems controlling
Dec 9 2022,positive,i think this was a great movie all of them were honestly i say this because there are people out there who have had a past of traumatic experiences and really dont know how to or dont have a desire to become involved in a relationship with someone it was nice seeing a movie that can help see what it can be like for people whove endured such a bad childhood there are many peoplechildren out there whove had a rough start in life i am one of those people and i hope that everyone who watches this movie can understand how difficult it can be to trust people
Nov 21 2022,positive,i had blasted in the past this movie simply because i could not accept what el james had decided to portray in the first book of the trilogy but it was objectively wrong to react like i did especially when judging the actors of the movie who were really good    i hope i can correct the damage by leaving correct reviews here    never judge a book by its cover  nor should you judge the relative screenplay
Oct 23 2022,positive,overall it was not the best but ill give it a   4  because it was somewhat enjoyable it was mainly because it was alright in some parts i love dakota johnson though dakota is so pretty sorry im a sucker for her what can i say shes hot like really hot  dakota johnson raised this from a two to a four instantly with those lips that seductive voice that body she is the epitome of hot
Oct 18 2022,neutral,not the best movie ive ever seen but not the worst i understood the premise of it and im 99 sure the book is better
Oct 7 2022,positive,this movie struck a nerve in my heart because i have felt something like this before it shows the feelings of being a dominant and owning a playroom they need to show more of his side i have never felt like this before thrilling being a dominant partner is so hard sometimes
Sep 30 2022,positive,was pretty mean because i was horny
Sep 24 2022,negative,am i supposed to find this toxic relationship romantic there are giant red flags all around
Sep 9 2022,negative,not a single positive thing that can be said about this movie in my opinion
Sep 2 2022,positive,fandango is the worst possible company ive ever dealt with fandango really sucks  i will be deleting my fandango app never use this junk app
Aug 31 2022,negative,i have nothing against jamie or dakota i just dont think either of them portrayed their characters well poor casting choices
Aug 30 2022,positive,i dont hate it lol
Jul 6 2022,negative,bizarre truly awful writing mindnumbingly bad 
Jun 28 2022,negative,dakota is a terrible actress
Jun 28 2022,negative,el james is a terrible writer and watching this movie it seems she had too much control over it
Jun 22 2022,negative,dont waste your time on this movie
May 24 2022,positive,i know this movie gets so much backlash but it really does follow the book and the first book was not greatly written but i like that you can tell the actor are trying their best and at least it seemed like they had a little chemistry that only grows with the films  i like that it was risks taken and even though it gets such low ratings it still grossed over a billion dollars because people dont want to admit that they were intrigued and turned on  it unleashed a lot of different sides of women all over the world
May 1 2022,negative,this whole movie was cringe especially the dialogues dakota is a mediocre nepotism actress jamie is a good actor and can do better than that and this im a shy innocent plain jane act made me laugh
Apr 23 2022,positive,a lot has been said about fifty shades of grey but most of the criticism was overly harsh as the movie is far from terrible in fact it operates on passable grade levels as its helped a lot by dakota johnsons terrific performance excellent cinematography and playful at times even selfaware dialogue but that dialogue also contains a lot of cringey lines that are simply laughable the movie is also far from truly sensual and certainly not truly provocative given that its target demographic have always been middleaged women christians character lacked depth the faux psychology of the third act was very annoying and this particular story needed more edge in terms of sex on screen and nudity consequently this flick is undeniably problematic in multiple areas but it is a consistently entertaining guilty pleasure watch nonetheless
Apr 14 2022,negative,this is one of the worst movies ive ever seen in my entire life only loses to the sequels i dont even know how this got sequels in the first place
Mar 23 2022,negative,hopefully as a heterosexual female student in her twenties with a love of film that spreads across all genres and decades this will come over as a fair assessment of a film that genuinely did nothing for me    have not read the books though have heard conflicting opinions that has mostly been intense dislike the reason for watching fifty shades of grey was not due to wanting to hate on it being a negative person curiosity but for the reason of being at a film night with friends recently and fifty shades of grey happened to be the film choice just for the record the general consensus ranged from indifference to hating it with a passion    there are two minor pros the best thing about fifty shades of grey is most of the beguiling soundtrack that has a soothing nostalgia and appropriately amorous quality this is all for the song choices though fifty shades of grey also looks good nice use of scenery and very nicely shot    on the other hand danny elfmans score is onenote and repetitive as well as too derivative of his recent work he has composed some wonderful stuff edward scissorhands is magical but this is really not his best work the direction has slickness but overall is too mannered which really affects the films tone and pacing    regarding the acting none of the supporting cast are of note including marcia gay harden but a larger issue is the two leads and their complete lack of chemistry understated can be a lovely quality to acting as long as it also becomes nuanced and with believability given to the dialogue dakota johnson especially in the first third is too understated that it feels more like there is a lack of personality or emotion jamie dornan looks uncomfortable throughout delivers his cringeworthy lines awkwardly and is just bland as dishwater with no charisma whatsoever chemistry is nonexistent    fifty shades of greys dialogue does them absolutely no favours dialogue so bad that absolutely nobody even the best actors and actresses can do anything with it it causes unintentional laughter throughout is embarrassingly clunky and is pure smut then there is the story that is so thin structurally heavy in repetition so badly plodding and without style or atmosphere that the film feels twice as long with the sexual elements done far too tamely and the bdsm portrayal deceitful none of the characters are engaging or interesting practically ciphers    all in all a very poor film with two minor pros and the rest of the film massively flawed 210 bethany cox
Mar 14 2022,positive,this series touched my heart in ways most people can never understand having grown up  surrounded by violence and alcoholism i can relate to christian greys character all too well especially once you learn about his background and fears of  getting attached to anyone his inability to differentiate violence from love was realistic and extremely sad i also love dakota johnsons sweet innocent and gentle wittiness  she was cast perfectly for the role of heroine the couple was depicted night and day different yet complimented each other in every way   aside from the unnecessary nudity i found their romance simply moving and beautiful   im not ashamed to admit i cried like a sap during the proposal scene in part 2 all in all it came together as a beautiful love story with lots of extra cheesy moments i fell for hook line and sinker and perhaps a few added cable ties duck tape and rope the whole serial killer package 
Mar 3 2022,negative,yep if this is love im out the main two characters both annoyed the shit out of me   first christian he was creepy as fuck a shy quiet university girl interviews him for a project or something and then he cracks onto her then they go on a coffee date where hes so bossy then after telling her they wouldnt work together he tries to control her when shes on a night out with her friends i get people are into bdsm and whatnot thats fine but he was very fucking possessive and controlling outside of the bedroom nah thanks  then anastasia she actually continues trying to be with this guy after his creepy as shit behaviour then as a romantic she protests how he refuses to go on proper dates do romancey shit and have her touch him but she still continues in this relationship and yet she repeatedly has these same reservations as if shes trying to change him its clear hes not budging so i dont know why she sticks around when shes not in the type of relationship she wants because then she cries and runs off when she sees the real side of him like girl you just asked him to give you his worst what did you expect you know hes got issues and is into this whipping shit that clearly ties back to his childhood trauma really dont know what she thought she was doing there    in that whipping scene at the end where anastasia runs off crying i couldnt even tell if christian was feeling remorse or was just turned on i couldnt even tell if he actually had feelings for her or if she was just a toy he could use to project his past traumas on    anyway this movie was just stupid you couldnt root for either main character they were both just incredibly annoying
Feb 20 2022,negative,i went to see another movie where this one was playing and i and i went in to see what all the fuss was about ive done more erotic stuff in bed than that and the leads are so boring and not that attractive
Jan 24 2022,negative,beautiful cinematography and thats it the fact that this was so sucsessful is a huge red alarm on how our society sees relationships
Jan 20 2022,negative,since i manage a movie review blog there are many times i get movies recommended to me solely because of how infamously bad they are over the years multiple people have told me suggested the fifty shades of grey trilogy i never had any interest in these movies since i had heard excerpts of the book and remembered laughably bad writing however i decided to sit through the trilogy with as open of a mind as possible and will now be reviewing them this first part is a bad movie in that it is boring almost all the way through and the dialogue is horrendous on top of that the two leads have no chemistry or compatibility so everything just feels off the movie has one scene that i can say is somewhat wellmade but thats not to say it was enjoyable i also thought the soundtrack was fair and the ending of the movie should have been the end of the series because dakota johnsons character actually makes the right call i cant believe people think this movie is romantic in any sense the character of christian grey is controlling and manipulative and gets away a lot simply because he is goodlooking and wealthy overall i would say unless youre morbidly curious like i was this movie is entirely skippable it features a bad story with poorly thought out characters and isnt as exciting as it thinks it is
Dec 25 2021,negative,this movie is so bad that it was a box office success and spawned two sequels what a great time to love originality or love that is substantial and not hollow empty and sadistic
Dec 14 2021,negative,now this is one freaking bad and boring movie most things christian does would make him the villain in any other tv show or movie
Nov 23 2021,negative,it looks like a sequel of the movie secretary where the acting was excellent
Oct 8 2021,negative,this was seriously one of the worst movies i have ever seen if not the worst no more to be said other than it had bad acting bad directing bad script and two hours long
Sep 6 2021,negative,what a disgusting show i cringed towards the end of the movie
Jul 29 2021,positive,romantic and suspense
Jul 13 2021,negative,christian i am still a virgin how wonderful ana then i can beat the sht out of you with care and love oh you will love it oh yes this is my dream instead of love and tender care you tie me up and beat me it will be such a love what chemistry what experience for an unimportant virgin who i am do it do it
Jul 5 2021,negative,incredibly boring it took me ages to try watching this and i was amazed at just how dull it is i just played games on my phone i was so bored it is hard to say the 2 main characters in reference to this film as that would imply they had characters where they do not badly written frankly just awful and hours of my life ill never get back  it has all   excitement of a wet rag
Jun 3 2021,positive,for people who read the books this adaptation is really good this movie was made for fans of the trilogy it is difficult for someone who does not know the history of the books to fully understand
Apr 23 2021,positive,i have to say this is a movie that does not deserve the harsh ratings many people give it   it is more than just a twilight clone and in fact a movie i consider to be far superior to any twilight movie in my honest opinion   the plot is a classic romance with a great bdsm twist the movie is not corny and it does not play out like a bad hallmark channel romance   the characters here are reasonably fleshed out their motivations make sense and there is an overall great plot   i personally love this movie i think it nails everything it aims to and is a must watch for all those who havent seen it yet
Apr 19 2021,positive,meh personally i dont like anything thats degrading others but despite my personal comment the movie itself is still fine but not exactly what you will call a remarkable one will worth your timepls expect a lot of sex scenes if you decide to watch it
Mar 29 2021,negative,50 shades of grey or as i like to say billionaire is a secret stalker and possible serial killer however i think it is the greatest baitandswitch movie in world history the movie and acting is so unintentionally or possibly intentionally bad that it secretly turns into a slapstick comedy from her randomly falling down in the beginning walking through the door to christian saying he wants to bite her lips it juts turns into a super insane comedy however it seems ana is also a freaking witch because her moods seem to control the weather    overall dont waste your time watching this movie i have previously reviewed highlander ii the quickening and some how that dumpster fire of a movie is better than this shitshow
Mar 14 2021,negative,i finally watched this movie after resisting for a few years i read the book it was mandatory for a business i formerly belonged to     no spoilers here i found the movie to have better qualities than the book christian was less cringe than the book by far and less the abusive narcissist as in the book however this movie wasnt great for starters whoever edited this movie clearly stopped trying about halfway through it felt choppy nonsequential and rushed by the end you really dont care about any of the characters also the character development is awful
Mar 13 2021,positive,i thought this movie was hot and intense the chemistry between jamie dornan and dakota johnson is also intense i saw people who compared this movie to a cheap p and i thought that was really unfair and inaccurate its not a movie to watch with kids obviously or your parents lol but i think its worth a watch if youre into this kind of thing hell its worth the watch just to see jamie dornan as christian gray
Feb 23 2021,positive,great romance film packs a lot of heart and a lot more soul then most other romance films maybe all the haters were caught off guard by that
Feb 21 2021,neutral,first off im shocked danny elfman did the musical score for this it was actually really well done i thought it was a pretty sick and disgusting movie but on the other hand the performances were alright its cinematography was beautiful and it had a sleek look to all its trashy content weeknds song earned it was alright but its not my favorite out of his library since its based off of twilight fan fiction id say that film was better even after we colided is better than this trashy mess i wouldnt say this is bad persay but its not a good movie as its too sick and overly sexual but it does have a few good things going for it in terms of filmmaking musical score songs and acting and i will say sigh it can succeed in being trashy even though i dont like how trashy it can get 510 maybe even a 6 definitely not a recommend but does get a few things right
Feb 15 2021,negative,zero rock bottom chemistry if a books purely built on a simmering relationship dont get lazy in the casting the story made millions for being ratedx and the studio basically gave it a michael bay pg13 treatment
Feb 14 2021,positive,your review will help others decide whether to watch
Feb 6 2021,negative,well this was a waste of time dumpster fire 
Jan 3 2021,positive,i could never do it but its a great story
Dec 29 2020,negative,its not the best movie ive ever seen but its also not the worst
Dec 21 2020,positive,im sorry but i kinda really liked this movie i think its a good movie
Dec 5 2020,neutral,from the bestselling book by el james comes the first film of the trilogy which sees dakota johnsons anastasia innocent virginal beauty be seduced by jamie formans christian grey and introduced into a bdsm world she knows nothing about   sure this is kind of a fluff movie and dornan is kind of woodenin his actingbut im still drawn to the sweet charm and beauty that dakota johnson naturally emits and makes her riveting to watch   i didnt mind this  wasnt as bad as i expected
Nov 27 2020,negative,the performances of the film are terrible without charisma and without brightness but it has a magnificent soundtrack
Nov 9 2020,negative,its an offense to call it a movie when its clearly obvious is a fanfic a fanfic that not even me would read
Nov 4 2020,negative,i felt violated afterwards  this movie basically tries to make abuse look sexy the characters have the emotional iq of a three year old especially the lead female role    i read two of the three books out of pure curiosity but started skipping entire pages and later chapters just to get through the book who has sex three or four times a day the books are childlike and absolutely boring also they have no storyline other than two people permanently having sex a woman with no backbone and an absolutely narcissistic controlling man    also if you tell a guy that you are still a virgin his response should not be let me help you with that problem    the movie and the books are creepy since when has it become sexy for a woman not to be able to choose how she wants to dress what she wants to eat where she wants to goeven her cellphone exercise and waxing habits are under his control she is basically just a possession    the movie is rated 16 only not nearly enough i sat in the movies with giggling 1618 year olds and thought to myself this movie should not be seen by anyone younger than 25 and in a healthy relationship with common sense to realize that this is not healthy or normal i would feel ashamed if i was the parent who allowed my 16 year old to watch this movie this is the basis that these emotionally fragile children will build their relationships on one day this movie opened a lot of doors that needed to stay shut    disgusting
Nov 1 2020,positive,68 it doesnt obviously have an impact to stand out but fifty shades of grey helps renew fallinlove orders with brilliantlyfashioned results
Oct 31 2020,negative,i wad never want to see men fucking women
Oct 24 2020,negative,even if you can put aside the fact that this film glorifies abuse the movie is just very very dull
Oct 11 2020,negative,its good to see porn pass as a mainstream movieartsy movie
Sep 29 2020,negative,its absolutely horrible 
Sep 22 2020,positive,iconic must watch
Sep 2 2020,neutral,what the flip did i just watch after years of procrastination ive finally seen this movie and its a weird movie but i kinda wanted to see what was going to happen next and sometimes i was like duh  thats predictable but sometimes i was like what in the actual for sure this is a bad movie but for what all the hype  was for this movie i can kinda understand it this is not an everybody type of movie you really have to actually want to watch this movie to kinda enjoy it i was just weirded out the entire time its a movie that im conflicted about for sure this has one of the worst movie endings of all time because its just so dumb and cheesy this is surprisingly not boring the side characters are boring 100 percent but the two main characters are pretty interesting aka only christian grey because you want to see why he does this stuff and finally after one movie we dont get an answer to that question so now i have to watch the sequel and im surprisingly kinda hyped to watch the sequel
Jul 23 2020,negative,remember when everybody was talking about the book fifty shades of grey by e l james do you also remember the equally terrible movie adaptation on valentines day weekend in 2015 the story of anastasia steele dakota johnson and her sadomasochistic relationship with young businessman christian grey jamie dornan has been the most entertainingly awful piece of literature and a subject of parody in the first half of the 2010 decade what made the novel so infamous were the exaggerated sex scenes and the laughable internal monologue the movie however trims those elements down in favor of a conventional romantic drama instead of raising the bar with jamess text dont get me wrong fifty shades of grey isnt without saucy moments but there are so few drips to squeeze and they get bogged down by scenes of mr grey gawking anastasia with materialism stalking her at dinner parties or sending creepy text messages christian has an entire collection of whips butt plugs and other bdsm sex toys yet he never takes advantage of them in the movie with the funny narration being replaced by generic pop songs the film also loses its charisma and never explores annies lustful desires im not asking for this movie to be ultrapornographic but i expected more steamy activity than just hard spanking and rubbing ice on the nipples despite sam taylorjohnsons effort to better the books prose the result of fifty shades of grey is extremely mild and not the least bit titillating 1 ½ exploding inner goddesses out of 5
Jul 15 2020,negative,it adapts its source material itself a ripoff of twilight in the worst way possible with ridiculous dialogue bland acting a nonsensical and problematic story and an incorrect and misguided adepiction of sexual intercourse and bdsm
Jun 22 2020,positive,great movie great actors
Jun 14 2020,negative,not romantic at all to me its too uneventful and unlikely no suspense or mystery too convenient and the ending is lazy rushed and too open
Jun 13 2020,negative,this movie supports porn and rape
Jun 11 2020,negative,fiftyshadesofgrey moviereview 010    pros    na    cons    pretty much everything    horrendous script    conveys a dangerous message    incredibly toxic and uninteresting main relationship    uncomfortable sex scenes because the leads have absolutely no chemistry    powerless female lead

Apr 12 2020,neutral,what the flip did i just watch after years of procrastination ive finally seen this movie and its a weird movie but i kinda wanted to see what was going to happen next and sometimes i was like duh  thats predictable but sometimes i was like what in the actual for sure this is a bad movie but for what all the hype  was for this movie i can kinda understand it this is not an everybody type of movie you really have to actually want to watch this movie to kinda enjoy it i was just weirded out the entire time its a movie that im conflicted about for sure this has one of the worst movie endings of all time because its just so dumb and cheesy this is surprisingly not boring the side characters are boring 100 percent but the two main characters are pretty interesting aka only christian grey because you want to see why he does this stuff and finally after one movie we dont get an answer to that question so now i have to watch the sequel and im surprisingly kinda hyped to watch the sequel 
Apr 6 2020,positive,i thought it was a great love movie it showed how two different kinds of love can finally become one great love
Mar 27 2020,negative,movie is a little retarded but you can watch it
Mar 20 2020,negative,i actually thought that i will like it dakota johnson is the only positive about this movie and the rest oh the rest the romance is terrible forced the cinematography isnt awful its actually fine enough the cast except dakota is terrible and the screenplay is terrible and pny as hell dont see it just dont
Feb 18 2020,positive,this is my new favorite movie
Feb 9 2020,negative,destroyed the book this man was not christian  she was a worse if possible anastasia what a fucking mess  disappointment
Feb 7 2020,negative,fifty shades of grey was a strange romance movie about a woman falling for a rich man who is in to some extreme sexual fantasies who falls in love with her but can they make it work the plot only consist of love confrontation and sex which becomes overplayed repetitive and boring
Jan 28 2020,negative,thats disgusting vomiting
Jan 10 2020,neutral,could be worse but overall it is a very messy movie but with strong performances
Jan 10 2020,positive,entertaining to a point
Jan 8 2020,negative,absolute shitacting dialogue and plot and poor excuse of bdsm
Jan 3 2020,positive,good movie if your a fan of the books and the love story people like to hate it just to hate it the sheeple have a heard mentality like that
Dec 30 2019,positive,great music and visually beautiful love the cityscape in this movie and the penthouse against it is gorgeous i really like dakota johnson and think she was a great fit for the character jamie dornan can obviously act eg the fall but he seems very awkward in the role they seem more relaxed together off set but anyways im a fan of the movie
Dec 27 2019,positive,so different nothing ive ever seen so far like it  cant even explain how much i love it
Dec 23 2019,negative,fuckin garbage film soulless characters terrible acting boring plot and no hardcore sex scenes stay away from this terrible film and its sequels
Dec 18 2019,negative,i swear theres probably porn out there with a better told story
Dec 11 2019,negative,is the world so dumb now that they are making movies dumber for people or is the media so dumb its making the world dumber
Nov 12 2019,negative,this movie is against of real life totally fake
Nov 11 2019,positive,i think the critics for this movie read the novel ahead of time recognized that it was poorly written and then immediately expected a bad movie and reviewed this negatively to fulfill the prophecy ill admit that some of the dialogue was corny and the basic premise of the movie was a bit flawed the guy used his position of power  his other positive traits to coerce the girl into agreeing to his abusive ones but in terms of adapting this novel into a movie there was a lot more that could have gone wrong that didnt the music was excellent
Oct 24 2019,negative,women love it i cant seem to understand why the man isnt labelled as creepy because hes rich and handsome what an abysmal carry on 
Oct 19 2019,negative,its even more shittier tgan the book although the acting was good but tge story is based completely on sex and tge movie displays the woman even   weaker than the book displayed her  
Oct 11 2019,negative,the movie that made it safe for every repressed indiana housewife to indulge her readers digest level sexual imagination and relive her sexual abuse by her relatives its actually pretty sad that grown women are so impoverished in their lives that they think that playing submissive is wired straight to their clitoris isnt that what uncle bob used to do to you in the shed ive heard this story a hundred times if this isnt submission to patriarchy at a base level i dont know hat is 
Oct 5 2019,negative,wth am i watching
Sep 22 2019,negative,the acting is so cringe it wants to make you laugh the sex scenes are boring and uncomfortable due to there being no chemistry at all  zip zero nada nothing it was embarrassing how shit both dakota johnson and jamie dornan are as actors the only decent  thing about the movie series is the audi r8 still a shit scene but with a tryhard fast and furious race
Sep 17 2019,negative,after all that buildup biggest crap ive ever seen
Sep 16 2019,negative,this is the most horrible movie in history  i wouldnt be able to watch a second part of it it doesnt have a story in it it is just crap  a girl  with a man having impractical sex escenarios doesnt make to much sense for me to watch but clearly people love this it only seems to me like theres to many ignorant people out there who dont like good stories that bring with them a moral teaching
Aug 24 2019,negative,normally i try to play nice with the movies i review as much as possible at least before 2018 anyway but fifty shades of greyno bookreading required to see why this glorified twilight fanfiction is the victim of snark bait slowpaced lacking in sex scenes and with an unlikable character whom our heroine keeps going back to despite have all the characteristics of an abusive boyfriend fifty shades of grey is an erotic disaster
Aug 16 2019,positive,really  is this the worst movie you ever saw  this is movie is not that badok  cant believe those review  i saw a lot review and just think  if this movie is really that bad  why everyone talk about it and sell so well  so i decide to watch it  and i really love it
Aug 10 2019,negative,the movie is so empty it is just focused on the sex part of the story christian and his demonds are not as demonstrated as i would like in the movie thus even though ana is quite shy her thoughts are everything its a plus for the whole story 
Aug 7 2019,negative,the film based on horrible sm femaleoriented smut novel based on horrible sm femaleoriented smut fanfiction based on horrible degenerated vampire femaleoriented smut film based on horrible degenerated vampire femaleoriented smut novel
Jul 29 2019,positive,people discount the romance and the strong woman because of the sex  there is much more depth to the movie than most people look for
Jul 1 2019,negative,lot a long winded bore the director made a mess out of this with the actors seeming to de as bored as i was dakota johnsons character was 5 different people as was jamie dornan which in 40 minutes you loast all care for them
Jun 28 2019,negative,i decided that after the trend had passed i would give it a try with no influence from past reviews let me tell you that youre not missing much from the book the dialogue is word from word unfortunately the high schoollike vocabulary is unchanged and provides a poor script i shouldve just watched the movie instead of achingly flipping through poorly construed pages in this  woman fantasy if thats not enough to frighten you the actors are cringey and awkward lets sum up anastasiaour main character who is biting her lip throughout this entire ordeal sexy indeed her personality is a bore it was 2015 when this came out its safe to safe damsels in distress dont exist anymore perhaps thats why they have made more powerful femalebased movies since then christian an awkward and insecure personality oof the forbidden fruit not my type of tea the only attractive trait he has is generosity by that i mean his ability to shower lavish gifts seattle seems to be the only accurate source but in the book its clear the author has no information other than that this movie tries to use sex as a weapon and im not certain that its true it does manage to make you feel embarassed however embarassed because of course you wasted your time watching and assesing how long it lasts theres no storyline behind it just an influenced and well advertised book from a former tv executiveyou would think there would be more  cringey awkward and laughable is what this confusing mix of a timeline is composed into they shouldve just scrapped the entire thing and went a different dirdction ive got to rewatch the thomas crowne affair after this headache
May 26 2019,negative,it is dump beyond redemption
May 13 2019,neutral,though as easy to follow the character development may be the result is not quite it seems and it should be shown as much as the print counterpart
May 6 2019,negative,theres nothing wrong with winning just with what one sacrifices along the way     this movie was originally an ebook and dabbles with social differences in childhood adoption vs not class wealthy vs middleworking class and sexual preferences bdsm vs not between christian and anastasia with more than a sprinkle of female objectification     jamie dorman makes a weak male lead  which results in some difficulty relating to his position dakota johnson is a strong capable female lead  resulting in the opposite of the above the result is an imbalance where one relates to the position of the woman when the two are in conflict which undermines the better balanced but rampant and contradictory characters in the book the other thing that got lost on the way was the raw pulpy sexuality in the book since there is only so far that one can go even in an rrated movie     depth aside the movie has some superficial entertainment value but falls horribly short of the better acting and storyline of geere and roberts in pretty woman which masters some of the same issues in this movie
May 4 2019,negative,ive never experienced a movie like this the first act was boring the second act was so bad it was funny and the third act was so bad it was scary
Apr 25 2019,positive,a softcore porn movie with comedy elements which should not be taken seriously
Apr 18 2019,negative,i would rather watch all five twilight movies than fifty shades of grey again
Apr 10 2019,negative,if you like the idea just watch the secretary
Apr 9 2019,negative,its embarrassing that this is a popular trilogy
Jan 15 2019,positive,i like this movie its very entertaining the acting is really good the script is not bad at all fifty shades of grey is not a perfect movie but i still think its very decent this movie is worth watching
Dec 21 2018,neutral,as weird as this movie was it got better towards the last 30 minutes i will say that it is a totally odd movie but due to the ending i feel like i need to watch the next 2 ill give it a 255 hopefully the next 2 are better 
Dec 2 2018,neutral,watchable for the hilariously sterile sex scenes horrendously awful dialogue and wooden characters only with copious amounts of alcohol whats a butt plug its a plug for your butt this is an actual conversation in this film
Dec 1 2018,negative,boring sm love story
Nov 28 2018,negative,bit tame have seen enough naked women on the internet so this was forgettable not as good as the film armageddon great sci fi action flick
Nov 24 2018,negative,even the actors who are convincing in other projects come across as unlikable and dull this is one adaption that should never have been made 12 star dedicated to the soundtrack
Nov 21 2018,negative,culturally it is the lowest point ever reached by the human race as a disgusted feminist
Nov 11 2018,negative,disappointing it didnt live up to its hype big screen lame porn film
Oct 12 2018,negative,the fact that this was based off of twilight fan fiction im not surprised how bad this movie is
Oct 10 2018,positive,apart from steamy sex scenes it had a great story and it lefts a intrigue at the end when christan and anna get seperatedjamie dornan have put life in the movie and dakota johnson played character of anna beautifully
Oct 5 2018,neutral,too much pussy and tit not enough dick
Sep 10 2018,positive,i dont know it just seemed boring  like i expected a movie about a domsub relationship to be so much more erotic and exciting  also i dont think they cast anastaisa well  i get what they were going for with the way they cast her  i just dont think it worked overall
Sep 5 2018,positive,actually better than i expected a few interesting dramatic moments and some decent acting 
Aug 25 2018,negative,do we really need another movie about sex theres a site called pornhub for that
Aug 17 2018,negative,bad acting bad plot bad movie
Aug 16 2018,positive,beautiful movie loved it so much my boyfriend and i had sex throughout the entire trilogy not only a spectacular film but it really gets you goin if you know what i mean
Aug 3 2018,negative,i didnt like this movie at all it was so chauvinistic im a person who believes in equality and everyone should be treat fair within any relationship
Aug 2 2018,positive,one of my favorite novels has finally came on the big screen  well it really was better than the novel in something  first it was faster and nonboring like the novel  second it was absolutely more erotic  but it wasnt an amazing movie cause it had the most dumb thing in the novel  the ending was definitely bad i know that it was from the novel but i didnt like it in the novel too  well the cast was sometimes ridiculous  so fifty shades of grey is such a good movie  the things i liked as a movie was  the cast not beside the novel was good and the couple was really talented but as a novel fan i expected more  the sex scenes was really erotic and romantic  the story was lovely and fast  thats all the things i loved and hated about this movie and i think that the reviews was really unfair and hard on it
Aug 1 2018,positive,it tried to take it to the next level but doesnt fully commit the cast is attractive the idea is there but thats all it is 
Jul 31 2018,negative,lame porn  they wanted to say its not porn but it is and not very good
Jul 23 2018,negative,got to be the worst film nothing like i imagined from the book a different actress could have saved this maybe
Jun 20 2018,negative,its like a boring thriller and an unsexy romance in one  blech
Jun 19 2018,negative,well i finally watched it id read the book and it was just disturbing no not because of the content which is just normal erotica but by the horrendous writing el james is a talentless hack the popularity of this book is just sad on many levels ladies there is much better erotica out there in fact im quite sure i could write my own better erotica in any case while the first 1520 minutes stuck to the book thats what made me almost turn off the ridiculous thing seriously stupid dialogue with absolutely no character generation at all just straight into it however id like to at least point out the positives one im so glad they used an actual writer for the screenplay kelly marcel changed up quite a bit especially toward the end that made the movie pseudo tolerable while jamie dornan had the arrogance down i expected a taller blonder more nordic look to christian and while dakota played the timid girlturnedsubmissive quite well i honestly expected someone more attractive yet given the crappy content they both made it work as best it could i admit i liked the ending much better than the book as it leaves anyone enjoying the film yearning for the followup which was really the intent all along
May 31 2018,negative,fifty shades of grey is a stupid movie with stupid screenplay acting and awkward chemistry but is adaptable from the book with an ending that pays off
May 19 2018,positive,contrary to popular opinion i loved this movie and yes there were cringeworthy moments but it was entertaining to watch
May 13 2018,positive,lots of nakedness from that actress which has an okay body the plot is good actors played a good role just felt that the film felt a bit long as she always wanted bdsm sex as he wanted it to turn on his own mojo as i guess he must had no semen after doing 15 ladies before the current one well this was the first of the 3lets see how darker aka the sequel does compare to this one 
May 13 2018,negative,for context my husband and i decided to watch fifty shades of grey as an outlet for our playoff frustrations  it seemed exactly the sort of movie that would appeal to our need to poke fun at something  surprisingly it wasnt quite as stupidly constructed as we had hoped  while the storyline is silly and the script painfully simple the scenes moved the romance developed and the ending gave us just enough of a cliff hanger to convince us to watch the next film
May 11 2018,positive,i enjoyed this film you have to remember that it is a fantasy everyone brings up that it is not realistic its not supposed to be lol
May 9 2018,negative,horrible the 2 have no chemistry 
May 9 2018,negative,for me it felt like to slow of a movie 
Apr 23 2018,negative,50 shades of grey  1 out of 5 wow this movie was bad horrible lines i had more fun mocking the film then watching it there is nothing overly offensive or sexual about this film just typical stuff you see in movie i thought the wolf of wallstreet was more sexual and had more nudity than this film my recommendation is skip this film all together even if you read the book youll be left disappointed the only reason to watch it would to be able to mock the horrible directing and acting
Apr 6 2018,negative,of the three movies this is the best thats not to say its great it isnt  the characters of christian  anastasia are close to what id expect having read the books the dialogue between them works and theres definite chemistry not sure im buying a uncomfortablelooking jamie dornan as a dominant mr grey though  kind of feels like they had a list of plot points to cover  checked them off without much thought
Apr 4 2018,positive,i thought it was a very good not great start to the series cant wait to watch the sequel 
Mar 11 2018,negative,entertaining enough not as terrible as i expected but i was insulted and angry as i am by most hollywood films i thought of all films this would be different but no this is aimed at women the cinema was full of women so why did i get to see so much full frontal naked woman in this film and barely a glimpse of naked man im a straight and im the target audience for this film doesnt take a rocket scientist to figure out im not really interested in looking at naked women and yet there was full frontal naked woman all the way through this film i do like to look at naked men i get the feeling that hollywood thinks i shouldnt like to look at naked men  even when dornan was having sex he was wearing jeans and johnson completely visibly naked i find it creepy    my first review on this site and probably my last apologies if and spelling mistakes etc i cant see what ive written can only view one line of text and cant scroll back through it autocorrect isnt working on this site and text appearing in capitals
Mar 2 2018,negative,surprisingly watchable if a little naff its seems a bit weird to talk cinematography but it was on point as was the killer soundtrack otherwise left me a little limp
Feb 11 2018,negative,an adaptation with more bark than bite as the hype surrounding it seems sexy with the actual product giving very little pay off
Feb 9 2018,negative,officially the worst film of 2015 why does this movie even exist this movie is like going to a theater hall and watching legal porn on a big screen
Feb 9 2018,negative,crap 1  exist for stupid people
Feb 5 2018,positive,loved it anyone that says otherwise is just a prude
Feb 4 2018,negative,average and womens sexual  fantasy movie  i will never watch fifty shades of sht movie
Jan 15 2018,positive,for a 16 adaptation its a great movie based on the romance and psychology but still misses some scenes and details to satisfy the books adepts
Jan 9 2018,negative,ok so positive first this film has good cinematographyokay on to the negatives the characters are flatter than flat and dumber than dumb they dont feel at all like people but just little devices used to manipulate audience into believing the film has characters nothing they do is logical likable or containing any sense at all the plot is just a brewing love story with some insanely mild bdsm that comes off as some softcore porn youd find on youtube so the writing is awful characters are awful narrative is awful and id at least love to say that this film at least tried to be original or unique and maybe just didnt work out but truth is it didnt try at all its a cash grab for those who read the book and i dont recommend this to anyone ever
Jan 8 2018,neutral,never read the books but my wife wanted to watch it so we did and it wasnt too bad of a movie entertaining enough for me to agree to watch the second and third once it comes out
Jan 7 2018,negative,not only was it the worst book i ever read it was also one of the worst movies ive ever seen
Jan 2 2018,negative,not sure why i thought it might be any good complete lack of chemistry between the two main characters stiff acting and so the intimacy scenes are a pain to watch terrible overall
Jan 2 2018,negative,this shit is garbage man better make a movie with better titles like the masterpiece the bye bye man man
Dec 29 2017,negative,watching this may give you cancer
Dec 24 2017,negative,horrible in every way
Dec 17 2017,negative,wow where should i start this movie made my paws itch and not in a good way i must say i havent written any reviews in 22 months but i just felt that i had to give my 02 on this one and just to be clear i didnt choose to see this movie it was picked for me by someone else you know who you are    let me be real clear up front this production contentwise is totally and utter crap thats what you get when you take a cringeworthy overinflated abysmal story that somehow became a hype and try to make some more hollywood money off of it    the production is slick like youd expect from a 201x movie no money was saved anywhere problem is the characters are so onedimensional that even those who are supposed to be lead characters are so limited that theres nothing to work with for the actors theres all kinds of talk and hints of complicated pasts that never show in what these people actually do or in the why behind it    okay maybe people didnt read the book or go see this film for the depth of characters or the interesting and attractive plot ahem but they wanted some real kinky bondage action played out in front of them they will be sorely disappointed here and even more so in the sequel if you think youre going to get anything of value here think again mr grey is a spoiler alert selfproclaimed sadist and admitted mysogynist instead of the dominant he pretends to be anyone with a little knowledge or experience with bondage andor bdsm will be appalled at what is shown here and how that lifestyle or preference is portrayed not only does the whole christian grey character give the impression that anyone with bdsmrelated inclinations has those feelings because of childhood abuse what is worse is that the activities he engages in that are labeled bdsm are as close to vanilla as the bdsmspectrum gets really production team is sexual intercourse where one of the two people involved is wearing handcuffs for the first minute of it deemed typical of bdsm in 2017 maybe i am jaded but these supposedly racy scenes seem more like a teenage girls trepid kinky fantasy than anything remotely close to the reality of a dominant mans mind    anyway in between these scenes that never really deliver what anyone read the other reviews on this site wanted out of them is a sappy chick flick that is even more generic flat and predictable than pancakes for breakfast its cringeworthy at times and boring for the remainder of the time no wonder it gets such a low audience score everywhere makes you wonder why some people actually give this a positive review     verdict avoid like the plague and smallpox
Dec 10 2017,negative,this is sorta garbage but oh well
Nov 28 2017,positive,enlightened america  that can handle the a walking dead  and  stomach rosie odonnell ellen degenerate the view etc  should appreciate a fifty shades of grey exceptional casting directing photography writingand editing who knows  many viewers may even learn a few bedroom tricks  see it with a love interest
Nov 19 2017,negative,pointless movie with bunch of mistakes in continuity i did not like it too much but it looks good as a film
Nov 12 2017,positive,loves this movie so much dakota johnson is amazing as usual i think people hate on this just to hate on things because its not bad
Nov 12 2017,negative,how did this trash even become popular    the story is terrible   ive never read the books nor do i want to but i assume this guy was supposed to be some gorgeous specimen   the actor was pretty darn ugly  just like the guy in twilight just adding that since this    great piece of literature started out as a twilight fanfic
Oct 3 2017,negative,blah as a typical book before movie person i only recently watched this movie   not that great but i feel like there was a lot of pressure on the actors to make it as heavy as the book the guy ok the girl yes anastasia was the plain jane girl but the actress here was picked as too plain feel shitty saying this but christian grey would have never picked a plain jane with that nose damn its so distracting i kept look no at her nose like if christian followed her instagram he would have got her a nose job before the new car
Sep 23 2017,positive,fantastic movie that is the best ive ever seen in my life everything about it was perfect and i immediately enjoyedwanted to see it again after my first viewing it deserves so much recognition instead of hatred 5 stars and 1010
Sep 17 2017,negative,jaime dornan and dakota johnson have absolutely no chemistry together nor the acting chops to fake any kind of sexual attraction  watching this movie is more painful than any spanking
Sep 16 2017,negative,as far as cringe inducing dialogue and energyless performances go ive seen worse but what makes fifty shades so numbing is its roadmap to nowhere of a plot
Sep 5 2017,positive,i never had any intention of watching this film but one day i decided to watch it and its annoying cheesy and beautiful all at the same time it tells the story of a young lady who is not very confident and doesnt believe in herself who meets a man who first off is intimidating but as the film progresses we learn that mr grey is very damaged i love how it explores the themes of mental physical emotional and sexual abuse so discreetly the first film is just about getting to know the complicated lives of the two main characters so there are no happy endings
Aug 24 2017,negative,i would rather watch all five twilight movies than fifty shades of grey again
Aug 10 2017,neutral,based on the novel by el james this exploration of bondage and the conflict between love and domination could have been far more risqué than it is here by no means a masterpiece yet there are moments where it rises above the material most of the credit for this should go to the undeniably charming and absolutely stunning dakota johnson as the tempted and confused heroine anastasia steele she is remarkably charismatic good fodder for fans who would definitely relish this
Aug 6 2017,positive,me want to watch this for the plot
Jul 19 2017,negative,just horrible a waste of time
Jul 19 2017,negative,worst movie since room
Jul 16 2017,negative,do not watch this film it is bad
Jul 13 2017,negative,just noseriously its a very boring film that went far longer than necessary and without a central wellwritten plot to guide it the actions that are taken by the characters are unrealistic and are forced without legitimate motivation other than the shallow romantic tension between the two main characters
Jun 1 2017,negative,fifty shades of grey accomplishes on a splendid soundtrack but suffers on crap dialogue sex scenes that are very pg13 and characters that really arent that interesting however the main characters performances are okay and the film does accomplish on steamy sex for fans
May 17 2017,negative,sadly it was as disappointing as i expected im probably the last hold out i agree if he was trailer trash it would be stalking and criminal he needs therapy not  toys
May 16 2017,negative,ive never experienced a movie like this the first act was boring the second act was so bad it was funny and the third act was so bad it was scary    010
May 9 2017,negative,overly long and boring diffently not as nasty as rumored to be i found this movie quite dull and slow moving would have been better if it were only about 90 minutes watch 9 12 weeks instead
May 8 2017,positive,i thought it was decent wouldve liked more of a back story though
May 6 2017,negative,two hours of anastasia biting her lips some great takes but not more than that
Apr 23 2017,negative,the book moves along not disclosing whether grey is talking about his fantasies or experiences  many men have extreme fantasies  from the opening scenes the movie is graphic and unappealing pure garbage
Apr 21 2017,negative,i want 2 give this zero stars but the app wont let me
Apr 13 2017,positive,i was expecting something betterim really desapointed
Apr 2 2017,negative,no story failed to depict the darkness and the journey through the darkness to the world of pleasure i havent read the books but the movie seems have thrown it without all away quite pointlessly may be expecting everyone will come to see the movie anyway based on the popularity of the book 
Mar 27 2017,negative,puke not entirely but generally
Mar 27 2017,positive,most of the stars here are for dakota johnson   i enjoyed the one review quote   if movie is 20 minutes of sex then rest of 40 minutes johnson biting her lip and 20 minutes with pencil in mouth  
Mar 24 2017,positive,entertainingly terrible should be filed under romcom    first off let me make it known that this film was utterly terrible however a bad review i feel would be harsh on the actors director and everyone who made the movie as everything about it was as good as it could possibly be except the story the story was the one element that was completely out of their hands there is only so well that you can polish faecal matter    it was actually entertaining in its ridiculous dialogue at times to the point of actual laugh out loud comedy    the best way i could find to describe this film is a hormonal girls mind with a multimillion dollar budget
Mar 23 2017,positive,this movie catches you by surprise like it did to me considering i read all the books  both stars were perfect in every way
Mar 21 2017,negative,worst movie ever the actress should kill herself
Mar 9 2017,negative,well i thought i would see what all the fuss was about and boy did i wish i hadnt i have seen very bad romantic comedies that are better than this film
Mar 8 2017,negative,i saw this since the hype was high but after i saw it i felt worse than thinking about the initial hype
Mar 5 2017,negative,now i only saw part of it on tv if people like romance well hear we go i will have to say im not a fan of movies that are rated r so i was not for this movie
Mar 4 2017,positive,i was not super impressed the first time i saw this movie it had been hyped up so damn much that i was expecting to be blown away like pretty woman good but for some reason i got the urge to watch it again  again  yet again the more i watched it the better it became dornan is super sexy especially when he eats her bread and johnson is stunningly beautiful 35 stars for the first viewing 15 for the effect it left on me afterwards for a total of 5 stars
Mar 1 2017,positive,i read the books and enjoyed them the film differs in my  opinion much tamer 3 stars are purely for jamie dornan as im a fan of his work in general but the film itself was a bit of a let down
Feb 22 2017,positive,admittedly i was alone and wasted on red wine but the right ingredients make the right dish
Feb 21 2017,positive,i have all the books i have all the books and have just seen the 2nd movie that blew me away  i wasnt bored at all a few things wasnt included from the book but it still had me melting into my seat all the fans will love it i just hope it doesnt take another 2 years to finish the last one
Feb 20 2017,negative,    ok that wasnt a movie that wasnt a story it couldve been a movie the characters easily couldve told a story and gone through an adventure but no we followed a little human infatuation that reaches a difficult moment and without any resolution the movie ends
Feb 19 2017,negative,sparse plot that leaves you leaving the theatre feeling a bit cheated saving graces were the ellie goulding track and jamie dornan but even so he couldnt save it from being a hot mess of a twilight fanfic
Feb 15 2017,negative,its like the person who wrote the script for this movie made it on their phone  oh wait they did
Feb 15 2017,positive,see my full review at 
Feb 14 2017,negative,i think i can see why girls might like the movie but i can also understand why the movie is hated so much     the characters they are okay but theres little to zero development hes a control freak hes a stalker and hes creepy she just falls for him without knowing anything about him  the dialog is alright for the most part but is  cringy at times     its a softcore porn which means everything is shown except the penis and the pussy her boobs are shown a lot which i loved     well thats pretty much all i have to say if you like it cool if you dont cool i must say though if you like because the guy is controlling than you are stupid because the guy is everything pretty much that girls are suppose to hate about men if you like the movie because of the male character then you should be ashamed of yourself
Feb 13 2017,positive,suffice it to say its not as good as the book but the filmmakers did a very good job of providing the expected amount of romance nudity luxury and sexuality for this film to live up to the hype  as the supreme love story of our time it is fitting that this treatment is slick superficial and above all safe it doesnt break any new ground artistically but it faithfully animates the innocent anastasia steele and the mysteriously sexy christian grey for the big screen
Feb 12 2017,negative,poorly plotted and quite flaccid movie doesnt live up to the hype about its supposedly controversial sexual content
Feb 12 2017,positive,oh ok i get it now girls love a mr grey
Feb 12 2017,negative,great potential yet such lack of commitment in all meanings of the word
Feb 12 2017,negative,fifty shades of poop
Feb 11 2017,negative,i tried to watch this film with the most open mind i could i couldnt get past the first 35 minutes this film plays like it was made by aliens who read about human sexuality and relationships in a book and then tried to recreate it you see what the filmmakers and actors are trying to do but its so horribly written performed and directed that it results in boring tedious and often hilarious parody of an erotic thriller the dialogue sounds like it was written by a 14year old girl writing her first screenplay in her journal the two leads are so miscast and deadpanflatline in their roles i was giggling uncontrollably when it was supposed to tense serious and sexy this film has no tension almost no likeable characters and is filmed in such a sterile emotionless way that it doesnt even qualify it as a sexy campy guilty pleasure really shows how much of a genius paul verhoeven is making trashy erotic thrillers that actually work what an embarrassment for all involved wow fsog is a giant steaming turd lacquered in expensive varnish
Feb 10 2017,negative,oh please one time i saw it i laughed at how bad it wasto make matters worse its based on twilight which makes it ten times worse not sure if i want to watch fifty shades darkerill prefer la la land over that lol p
Feb 10 2017,negative,im not the kind of person who likes to say bad things about a film just for the sake of it even if a film has a not so good reputation ill always give it the benefit of the doubt and give it a go keeping my mind open to possibly liking it i did this with fifty shades of grey the big screen adaptation of el james hugely successful novel putting aside any preconceived notions i had i went in with a blank slate and just let the movie speak for itself and it did speak for itself and it was not good the film stars dakota johnson and jamie dornan as the leads anastasia steele and christian grey and follows their romance for lack of a better as he introduces her to his rather abnormal lifestyle    ill start off with a positive possibly the only one in this entire thing is the film well shot yes it is its nothing extravagant but it is fairly competently well filmed and the way some scenes are lit are actually not bad the board room meeting between ana and christian comes to mind as a good example of some decent attempts at nice lighting having said that the directing in every single scene is beyond basic it is amateurish and so forced and needy instead of letting the relationship organically form director sam taylorjohnson lingers on shots that are meant to induce feelings of passion and excitement but instead come off as completely hokey and at times just plain idiotic and the script really doesnt make things any better it is absolutely horrendous not a single line feels original or inspired the entire story feels like some immature fantasy which is exactly what this is look it up this whole thing started as twilight fan fiction and it really shows    dakota johnson is a decent enough actress but here she is bland boring and incredibly dull in fact her character is very similar to the bland boring and dull bella swan played by kristen stewart in twilight another actress who is fairly decent in her own right but was robbed of all emotions and acting abilities in those films as for jamie dornan he is meant to be playing an emotionless person but his performance here lacks any sort of resemblance of how a human being behaves and he is not helped with his robotic and totally unnatural dialogue there is zero chemistry between the leads and even amongst the rest of the cast theres absolutely no connection between anyone everything feels so fake and unnatural the only relationship that seems just slightly credible is the one between ana and her mum which takes up a total of maybe two minutes screen time after that its back to the crappy boring story which we have to endure for the other 120 minutes    one of the main problems with fifty shades of grey is that its so damn boring there is not one interesting thing to enjoy in this joke of a film there are a few moments of unintended comedy with certain lines of dialogue but as a whole the bloody thing isnt even so bad its good its just bad really bad the film even seems to be afraid to embrace its main premise for all its hardcore talk the actual scenes that depict any sort of sexual activity are so incredibly tame yes there is nudity but so does 70 of other sex scenes already out there so what is there about the scenes in this film that sets it apart because there has to be something for this is the whole catch of the film after all the answer absolutely nothing the film cant even identify with its own ridiculousness making the whole thing very hypocritical and the entire effort feels so staged and rehearsed every movement and gesture just feels so unnatural and predetermined there is absolutely no spontaneity in any of the scenes    however by far my biggest problem with the film is the love story if you can even call it that this is the most unhealthy relationship ive ever witnessed on screen it baffles me why a girl like anastasia would be even remotely interested in a creep like christian grey there are so many red flags early on she should have just run run and not looked back just the fact that hes ordering her around after having simply bumped into her a few times should have set off some alarm bells also there are honestly some sick and twisted themes and story points that come up in this film that are simply glossed over or even worse the film at times tries to validate this behaviour such as child abuse christian grey specifically says that he is friends with the woman who sexually abused him when he was a teenager i mean what the hell    the film is really an insult to anyone who takes filmmaking seriously the fact that this series has now made a billion dollars when there are so many amazing films that dont even get to see the light of day is so wrong fifty shades of grey is not just a bad film its horrible on so many levels its fifty shades of pure horrendous writing crappy acting and uninspired filmmaking to put it simply the film bloody sucks
Feb 10 2017,negative,kys    i havent seen the movie and i never will
Feb 9 2017,negative,weak acting abysmal writing and some misogynistic overtones make fsog a chore to watch on any screen
Feb 7 2017,negative,i went into fifty shades of grey knowing that im not the target audience but there have been plenty of times where my preconceived notions proved incorrect and i found myself enjoying a property i predicted i wouldnt  this one is not one of those cases  fifty shades proved to be a very boring movie that suffered from a dragging plot terrible dialogue and two lead actors who have no chemistry and werent that memorable at all in their roles  the film also suffers from a story that didnt feel like it was going anywhere or building up to anything contained too long of a running length and an ending that comes out of nowhere and isnt a very satisfying conclusion  i will add that the sex scenes the heart of this property were actually wellconstructed but that cant save this otherwise unengaging and uninteresting film    hello  my name is rev ron and if you feel like seeing some more of my reviews you can visit my blog at revronmoviesblogspotcom  you can also head on over to therobotspajamascom for various articles i write there and if you feel like it you can follow me on twitter revronster  thanks
Feb 6 2017,negative,seriously what was the movie even about really
Feb 3 2017,negative,iwas high af drunk and this movie wasnt funny at all twilight and sequels were more entertaining than thispiece of not definitely art if you want a movie with sense or better actors just watch someporn
Feb 3 2017,negative,theres a lot of things a movie can do to be considered bad bad acting editing directing or music any of these elements can make a film underwhelming but still leave you with a decent syory if there is stuff happening and youre being kept engaged the ultimate sin of cinema is being boring and 50 shades of grey might be the biggest offender of that rule    i went into this film having not read any of the books and even after watching this movie it seems like you still need to read the book to understand slot about these characters we have anna the indecisive awkward and very plain looking virgin who is smitten with billionaire christian grey grey seems more like gordon gecko as a bond villian he seems like he would have drinks with patrick batemans and goldfinger and quickly becomes obsessed with anna and controlling every aspect of her life in what seems like very creepy stalkery  almost gaslighting behavior the main plot point of the whole movie is this stupid contract hes trying to get anna to sign saying shell be his submissive and do whatever he says nevermind shes already been doing everything he says    the rest of the movie plays out as lame pg13 kinky sex scene lame he says hes not into relationships she gets ready to leave him he storms after her and says he needs her she reminds him she hasnt signed the contract and then she does what he wants anyways this sequence of events happens about three or four times in a row with little dialogue between its all very boring and tedious    aside from this movie being two hours long and as boring as cspan the absolute worst part was that there was no conclusion the ending was banking on this movie being successful enough for a sequel unfortunately they were right i recommend this movie as a cure to insomnia but in no way shape or form was it entertaining fk this movie    055
Feb 1 2017,positive,love this movie cant wait for the next one jamie dornan was everything i wanted christian grey to be  dakota johnsons performance was also splendid
Jan 29 2017,negative,and a half star is kind not only is it stupid but also way over the top sexually gross ugh
Jan 28 2017,negative,this movie is one of the worst movies i have ever seen the writing is terrible the acting is the plot is as well not only is the dialougue unrealistic but it was also dry and badly portrayed by the actors whom have no chemistry
Jan 22 2017,positive,loved this movie cant wait to see the next 2
Jan 17 2017,positive,they stayed pretty true to the book its definitely not a movie i would have gone to theatres to see but overall i thought they portrayed it well
Jan 15 2017,positive,as a lover of the books i have to say i loved the movie even though i would have loved for them so have gradually came the fist love seen as in the book i also wish there would have been a few more love scenes like if the would had put the full bathtub scene like the book or the silver balls haha but i still loved it any over of the book whom reads it for the actual story and not just the erotic part would love the way portrayed the amazing book
Jan 15 2017,positive,hearing that a sequel to fifty shades of grey was going to be coming out this february i decided to see this movie but i really didnt know what i was getting myself into because its got the universal reputation of being really bad but you cant expect a great film based on a dumb ass erotic book in result its not so terrible its full of sex which is always cool its got some nerve thats for sure but what the fuck was the ending supposed to mean i hope that its connected to the sequel cause without it it means nothing
Jan 10 2017,negative,this is the kind of blockbuster that makes me lose all faith in humanity
Jan 8 2017,negative,im no no thank you never again
Jan 8 2017,negative,one of the worst movies i have ever seen shouldve made a movie loosely based off the book because the writing in the book  in all honesty wasnt that good i believe the only reason it was so successful is because it wasnt the normal run of the mill romance novel too much like the book imo boring  bad acting along with the bad writing  horrible  just skip it  youll be better off 0 stars
Jan 5 2017,negative,i rated halfstar 
Jan 2 2017,negative,more like 50 shades of boring acting and screenplay was somewhat comical at times entire movie felt too fake
Jan 1 2017,negative,i wont even get into why the novel sounds like utterly asinine stuff and concentrate why the movie is probably a lot more tame and also nothing to get excited about sure there are some entertaining and amusing parts and of course a few sex scenes that show a lot of johnson but once the whips are whipped out things get really repetitive until there suddenly isnt much of an ending and the film just stops especially the last 15 minutes with all the crying are really boring and annoying avoid and watch porn instead
Dec 27 2016,positive,edit 2 4k is pretty still 3 stars edit just watched the unrated versionnot too differenton second watch acting is pretty bad throughout just better than i expected when i heard worst actor and actress and chemistry between mains for 2015i still enjoyed itprobably because i liked the books once i got past the first book first half of the movie was surprisingly good then the quality just went downhill sad
Dec 25 2016,negative,yes i watched it no it wasnt very good
Dec 10 2016,positive,terrible romance hilarious comedy
Nov 30 2016,negative,blander than the coffee they serve with take out
Nov 21 2016,negative,well i finally watched it id read the book and it was just disturbing no not because of the content which is just normal erotica but by the horrendous writing el james is a talentless hack the popularity of this book is just sad on many levels ladies there is much better erotica out there in fact im quite sure i could write my own better erotica in any case while the first 1520 minutes stuck to the book thats what made me almost turn off the ridiculous thing seriously stupid dialogue with absolutely no character generation at all just straight into it however id like to at least point out the positives one im so glad they used an actual writer for the screenplay kelly marcel changed up quite a bit especially toward the end that made the movie pseudo tolerable while jamie dornan had the arrogance down i expected a taller blonder more nordic look to christian and while dakota played the timid girlturnedsubmissive quite well i honestly expected someone more attractive yet given the crappy content they both made it work as best it could i admit i liked the ending much better than the book as it leaves anyone enjoying the film yearning for the followup which was really the intent all along
Oct 14 2016,negative,terrible representation of bdsm with bad acting shit story and cringeworthy dialogue the only plus this garbage actually has is a few seconds of dakota johnsons ass getting whiped gently  once
Sep 18 2016,negative,fifty shades of grey is suppose to be a controversial subject but the film is so average that it just comes across as another run of the mill chick flick
Sep 16 2016,negative,i think ive done most of the stuf in the movie  only never wipt my girlfiend for 6 times with a wip on her ass  if the the book is the same as this movie i dont understand why woman did get turned on by this  dont have to go to scool to learn this my idea  simple
Sep 16 2016,negative,fifty shades of grey2015  starring dakota johnson jamie dorman jennifer ehle eloise mumford victor rasuk luke grimes marcia gay harden rita ora max martini callum keith rennie andrew airlie dylan neal rachel skarsten and emily fonda  directed by sam taylorjohnson  review  mr grey will see you now  hello kiddies your pal the cupid critic here and you know what i hate try mixing twilight with porn it equals crap now make that crap into a movie and you get something much worse this movie  this film is based off the popular novel by el james which was started as a twilight fanfiction turned into a novel became a best seller somehow and now its one of the worst movies of this year but guess what its made money so were going to have to sit through the next two sequels that will probably be made the film is about anastasia steele who does an interview for her friend kate who is sick but after ana comes back from the interview she feels better miraculously for some reason ana has to interview christian grey who is a young and very successful billionaire she has the hots for him for some reason and is being asked to sign up to be his submissive to explore her sexual side  the film has the goal of appealing to its demographic i am not among that demographic but as film that is meant to have meaning or be enjoyable or fun even it most certainly does not succeed all the characters feel like one dimensional realworld twilight characters you got the female lead who is in love with the tough guy who is dangerous for her youve got the completely different friendroommate and good friend who is in love her which sets up the love triangle  you probably want to know what i thought about the bdsm sex scenes their there and i was not aroused they are just filler and a plot device to tell this story your girl might take you to see this but will make you delete your porn history the acting in the film is alright from dakota johnson i feel she could be doing better if the dialogue want so horrible the direction is actually kind of good too but as a whole this movie is fifty shades of crap im giving it one silver ball out of five if youve read the book youll get the silver ball reference
Sep 13 2016,positive,wow movie is fantastic a definite eyebrow raiser perfectly filmed i cannot wait for the next movie all ready read the book and loved it
Sep 10 2016,negative,this sort of crap which shows women as sex objects should not be allowed to be on general release despicable
Sep 4 2016,negative,the worst there casted the worst actor and actress
Aug 24 2016,negative,one word  pornography
Aug 15 2016,positive,emotionally disturbing
Aug 13 2016,negative,garbage same as the book and its monstrosity of a writer  condones sexual violence and glorifies it would rather rub pepper into my eyes than watch any more of this series
Aug 12 2016,negative,fifty shades of grey isnt one of the worst movies of the year but its still far from anything really great think of it as twilight without the vampires and werewolves and just a lot more sex the film is filled with cheesy dialogue and bad acting the cinematography is wonderful though as is the musical score i dont find the movie to be very romantic either or believable if youre a fan of the book may like it more but for me it was kind of a snooze fest overall
Aug 9 2016,negative,this movie is a fanfiction story of the twilight booksmovies that statement alone can determine whether this is a good movie or not
Aug 5 2016,negative,this movie glorifies sadism sexism and rape culture  it is sick sick sick
Aug 2 2016,negative,how can someone waste time and money making this
Jul 30 2016,positive,the hype about the movie while misplaced is certainly not misrepresented unlike the book it is based on the film is no longer mere erotica while it obviously contains explicit scenes they are merely complicit to the story and are not the foundation of the plot thanks both to the quality of the filmography as well as the brilliant talent of the cast fifty shades of grey has evolved from a novel of sexual deviance into a gripping tale of the struggle between unfulfilled passions and overwhelming desire while its suitability for family movie night may be questionable it is without doubt a great way to spend two hours and nine minutes with your loved one or a close friend enjoy
Jul 30 2016,negative,this is one of the movies that wabted to make romance movies mixed with sex scenes which it fails in bad acting with bad screenplay bad directing the only good thing in it was the cinematography and soundtrack you will feel  as if you wanna kill yourself will watching it
Jul 25 2016,negative,72016 this whole thing is pretty stupid  why doesnt she just tell this guy that he sucks  anyway it took us 3 sittings to actually finish the film and the end really offered nothing except a really that is the end  so that pretty much sums it up  as erika said about the book the whole hype about this story makes no sense
Jul 23 2016,negative,better than tinder and snapchat
Jul 20 2016,negative,really really really bad
Jul 20 2016,positive,stylish not bad for those whove never read the book  the cast was good in my opinion  kinda looking forward to the sequel
Jul 18 2016,positive,best valentine movie ever if you want to see the whole different scenes
Jul 17 2016,neutral,such a horrible movie that i actually had fun watching it
Jul 16 2016,negative,boring excruciatingly slowpaced badlyacted badlywritten uninteresting umm shall i continue far from sexy not very sexual easy to laugh at for the most part yet from a point on even that one small joy is denied as you have to witness one more tedious conversation and one more halfarsed bdsm sex scene im really stretching it here by calling it that i cant really think of any redeeming quality other than the fact that ive seen more awful films its still pretty shite though
Jul 16 2016,negative,ugh i went to see the 5 buck movie and still wanted my money back nothing good about this even if you read the books dont see this
Jul 12 2016,neutral,i expected more it was missing a 
Jul 7 2016,negative,a star for the pretty interiors
Jun 29 2016,positive,a porno without being a porno i love it  they took love and added sex with some bdsm
Jun 29 2016,positive,this beautiful live story
Jun 29 2016,positive,in fifty shades of grey jamie dornan and dakota johnson sizzle and i like the soundtrack too not for kids     one concern that i have is that some young people watching this will think that an extreme sort of power imbalance in a relationship is idyllic no its not
Jun 29 2016,positive,this is very interessantes its a 5 sat er
Jun 29 2016,positive,there were a lot of negative comments made about this movie but i loved it  just not the end
Jun 29 2016,positive,you have to read the books first to understand whats going on for real
Jun 29 2016,positive,amazing movie i love their love story
Jun 29 2016,positive,its best to read at least the first book before seeing the movie that way things can make a lot more sense and you can understand it a lot more
Jun 29 2016,positive,exceptional movie screw the haters loved it
Jun 29 2016,positive,amazing leaves one breathless
Jun 29 2016,positive,mr grey should come see me now
Jun 29 2016,positive,the movie seemed to be rushed  the storyline  could  have  been  more in depth but otherwise  it is  like  the  book   im glad  it wasnt  overloaded  with  sex scenes  like the  book 
Jun 29 2016,positive,love  the extended version is much better 
Jun 29 2016,positive,great movie loved everything about it
Jun 29 2016,negative,im not impressed with how the movie danced around the issue of the abused and the abuser issue  this psycho dominant and submissive relationship is not about romance and definitely was not romantic too many women are victims of abusive relationships and trying to make it glamorous is a shameful way to get money out of the pocket of moviegoers  the fact that the movie is a flop is not surprising
Jun 29 2016,negative,ughridiculous depiction of a lifestyle as with the books the story could have done with some research on an actual bdsm relationship the author never even entered a scene and it shows the very least the actors could have tried i am legitimately sorry this story and movie exists let alone was widely received i just see an abusive relationship and a sexually confused perpetually orgasming which is extremely confusing like shes not a porn star she doesnt need to come continuously to propagate an image girl who is an annoyingly meek dud
Jun 29 2016,positive,so great to see such a great book make it to the big screen
Jun 29 2016,positive,if you know about poetry you will understand this movie well at least thats how i feel about it
Jun 29 2016,positive,i thought this was an excellent movie stayed pretty close to the book recommend anybody sees it
Jun 29 2016,positive,complicated love story with a dash of kink to keep the story juicy i loved the book but the movie delivered fairly close it is ultimately a love story but the movie cannot provide all the back story so if you feel a little confused on why the characters are the way they are read the book i couldnt put it down i watched with hubby at home and he enjoyed it but i had to fill in a few gaps good stay at home with significant other and remember it is not you got mail 
Jun 29 2016,positive,seeing the movie only made me want to reread the books again and they were better the third time around dakota  jamie really bring anastasia and christian to lifeim waiting anxiously for the next two books to be made into film so much more happens with all the characters in books 2 and 3 it will be truly a fast action ride
Jun 29 2016,positive,great movie to follow an amazing trilogy excited for the next two
Jun 29 2016,positive,i dont know why so many people are not liking this movie but i think its pretty good granted i saw it without reading the book first just give it a shot you may end up liking it
Jun 29 2016,positive,omg i loved this movie
Jun 29 2016,positive,great love story especially if you have read all three books as the story progresses  the characters are beautifully developed and have depth  there is a great story here not just sex anyone who says this promotes abuse against women has not read the books or seen the movie he really loves her he changes for her he has weaknesses she is strong not a door mat or a poor little girl who is easily manipulated is this a story that will really happen no but neither are most of the movies we see do men or women especially men orgasms multiple times in one hour no but it is a movie people it is fantasy something to take you away from real life have fun with it
Jun 29 2016,positive,doesnt quite reach the intensity of the book but still good cant wait for darker to come out
Jun 29 2016,positive,love this movie cant wait for the next 2
Jun 29 2016,negative,not nearly as good as the book

Jun 29 2016,positive,omg when is the next movie coming out
Jun 29 2016,positive,love the movie wish it followed the book more but good movie cant wait until the others come out
Jun 29 2016,positive,some might find it uncomfortably funny but i enjoyed it
Jun 29 2016,positive,they did a great job keeping with the book and filmed in a way that was classy yet still incredibly sexy and arousing in my opinion
Jun 29 2016,positive,i loved this it was sensual without being distasteful cant wait for fifty shades darker
Jun 29 2016,positive,not terrible but not good either 
Jun 29 2016,positive,the ending not what i expected
Jun 29 2016,positive,my new favorite movie  so close to the books great  job
Jun 29 2016,positive,if you were a big fan of the book series you will be very happy with the movie
Jun 29 2016,positive,it is a great movie alltho i do recomend reading the books first  there is some things that where left out of the movie i would have liked to have seen but if you read the books it kinda fills in whats left out
Jun 29 2016,positive,loved it cant wait for the next three
Jun 29 2016,positive,loved it almost as much as the books
Jun 29 2016,negative,surprisingly this was just about watchable enough not to get the fifty shites of shit review i thought id be giving it but let me be clear having struggled to read the appalling book gave up around page 50 my very low expectations probably contributed to my not hating it when it turned out to be yknow okay
Jun 29 2016,negative,fifty shade of boring starz channel spartacus had more action
Jun 29 2016,positive,it was sooooooo much better than the book i never read past the first but now i wanna know what happens
Jun 29 2016,negative,only because i couldnt give a zero rating
Jun 29 2016,positive,loved it great couple movie
Jun 29 2016,positive,amazing movieloved it
Jun 29 2016,positive,i really liked this movie  the book is even better
Jun 29 2016,positive,loved this movie cant wait until next one to come out
Jun 29 2016,positive,love this movie cannot wait for darker
Jun 25 2016,negative,you could have almost heard the public groaning when it was announced that the el james erotic novel was being turned to a movieas expected everything was bad about it including the writing and the acting even the sex was bad in the end the movie was ripped apart as for being an excuse for middle aged women to watch bdsm
Jun 16 2016,positive,fuck these people who are rating it three stars or lower this movie was amazing
Jun 15 2016,neutral,this movie was really very bad the acting was terrible the love story was barely believable and the whole thing just fell flat the only truly beautiful scenes were the love scenes which i found to be artistic and sensual other than that this was a major bomb
Jun 13 2016,positive,its more like a love movie with more sex part shooting beautifully looking forward to the 2nd one
Jun 13 2016,positive,it was pretty okay i cried why did it end like that they were supposed to be in love he was supposed to change anastasia christian bam help me let me travel forward in time to the sequel what is to come of them in conclusion i dont like reading so im not gonna read the book i will simply sit in the corner and cry for a year
Jun 12 2016,neutral,no idea what this was about going into itlol
Jun 10 2016,positive,i read many reviews from other critics i was very surprised i was late watching the movie because i havent had the time but when i did get the chance to see it i became rather fascinated by the characters my interest went beyond the sex scenes i loved the fact that there was a certain depth to the character of christian and how anastasia wanted to understand more about him i felt as if it drew me in deeper    the only problem i have with the movie is the ending but i do understand it makes the viewers want more which is good for the sequel   i believe that the movie was well written performed directed and e all of the above
Jun 8 2016,positive,loved every minute of it
Jun 4 2016,negative,this movie does not do the book justice in any way shape or form i was actually angry that i watched it
Jun 4 2016,neutral,not gonna lie but this actually wasnt half badat least not as most critics make it out to be sure theres a lot of sex scenes but this was basically a somewhat interesting chick flick that didnt fall back on stupid clichés although on that note its far from perfect the relationship the two lead characters had was a bit annoying at times and kind of eye roll worthy also that ending made me laugh big time i mean what hahah as for the sm and bonding stuff thats just weird as hell in my opinion just fyi
Jun 3 2016,positive,this was a far better movie than given credit by some  i sometimes think there are a few moralists out there that think they gain points with st peter by slamming movies of this genre  this movie was well written with strong character portrayal
Jun 3 2016,neutral,his amorous advances are at first accepted until he starts to condition it with his sadistic control that demands a submissive partner sad  lonely ending after all
Jun 2 2016,positive,i loved the movie and the actors that protrayed the characters
May 28 2016,negative,not as bad as i thought it was going to be still shit though so cheesy i was laughing at how stupid it was
May 27 2016,negative,a romance novel by the numbers
May 26 2016,negative,this movie was more like fifty shades of blah with poor performances and lack of chemistry  i just dont get why or how grey would be seeking bondage or any other explicit act  there was no general direction and didnt know where it was going  dont bother with this crap of shit
May 24 2016,negative,horrible acting static scenes nothing real at all just a filler for the fucked up women generation today
May 21 2016,negative,i skim watched it for absolute curiosity i was bored as hell and the sex scenes they were so breif i was only mildly aroused in any sense of entertainment its just so awkward to watch visually it is great narrative is terrible and the sound track i think thats the best bit i have never said that about a film before id rather wath titanic again and thats 9 hours of my life i will never get back
May 16 2016,negative,the worst movie i ever seen no more
May 14 2016,negative,the best thing about this movie is the soundtrack period the story dialogue and characters were noticeably forced and faked and empty its like an irrational soulless movie that inexplicably put together plot points so they can be immediately broken and left to the viewers acceptance maybe this is the point but if so its the biggest flaw f
May 11 2016,positive,i thought this movie was filmed with taste
May 7 2016,negative,one of those movies that i wanted to stop watching but kept it on hoping it would get better  personally didnt like the casting anastasia particularly wasnt believable the script or the acting
May 1 2016,negative,total wastage of time 
Apr 30 2016,negative,like a terrible cinemax movie but for the big screen  what a pointless plot with no ending in sight
Apr 26 2016,negative,the lack of romance made this movie seem like an abusive relationship im sure the book is better than the movie
Apr 25 2016,negative,play full movie fuck face
Apr 20 2016,neutral,i have not read the book nor will i ever read it  however i think that dakota johnson does her best to keep a very badly written story somewhat interesting  ultimately it is pointless and cliche  the sex scenes are played very safe from a visual point of view  mehi couldnt really care any less about this series moving forward
Apr 19 2016,negative,this film is terrible in every way imaginable it is a disgusting  misrepresentation of bdsm bdsm is founded on an emotional romantic  connection between partners there is no romantic connection between  christian and anna christian is very vocal in how he doesnt want a  romantic relationship he doesnt do romance or dating     the characters are horrible and annoying christian grey is creepy  controlling and possessive and anna is just whiny and irritating     the dialogue is absolutely awful and made me cringe so many times i  dont make love i fk hard and im fifty shades of grey had me  crying tears of laughter    read my full review here 
Apr 15 2016,negative,i havent seen anything this fake before they all seemed to be acting on a long dull commercial awful     and that ms dakota johnson she needs to be banned from appearing on the screen ever again shes beyond fake and overdoingit
Apr 12 2016,positive,i had seen this movie at least twice and at first i wasnt interested in watching this movie until i decided to give it a go before i give my own opinion     hmmm hmmwell for starters i cant really say its bad or what not but ill just say that its too much of sex and bondage stuff im not a fan of bondage because it would make me cringe every time i look at it i mean its about a young 21yearold woman who fell in love with a 27yearold entrepreneur who wasnt looking for love and had her sign a contract on becoming a submissive and all that jazz not really romantic if you ask me      it wasnt really that much of a plot if it has too much erotic scenes of them boinking and such its full on porn but ill be honest i watched it again and i just cant help but watch it over and over i own four books of the series and i usually like to read books more than watching the movies    overall its a good average movie ill be looking forward to fifty shades darker  by next february
Apr 5 2016,negative,one of the worst movies ive ever seen it was even worse than the book its like they tried to be awful
Apr 3 2016,positive,loved the books this movie however good on its own does not do justice to the book by any means too many details are left out and the sex scenes everyone waited for where nowhere close to the intensity of the book i hope they step it up all the way around in part 2
Mar 25 2016,negative,this was the least sexy sex movie i have ever seen it was lame from beginning to end it was a date night moviechosen by my wife that couldnt even be saved by nudity
Mar 18 2016,negative,who knew that a movie about s  m could be sooooo boring the acting soooo bad the story is sooooo stupid
Mar 14 2016,negative,boring plot boring movie
Mar 13 2016,negative,robotic acting and generally not my cup of tea
Mar 12 2016,negative,fifty shades of fucked up
Mar 10 2016,neutral,what the fuck are you expecting it is a movie based on an erotic  novel it is some kind of romance that makes people horny yeah its  fucked up but it emphasizes how fucked up people are and shit if you  like sex youll love this movie the book is obviously shit so maybe  this movie isnt all bad so theres a lot of sensual shit in this  movie but it aint porn because im a sexxxpert when it cums to that if  you like really hardcore sex go watch a porno or some shit if youre  a romance fan you will probably hate this but i work at jacking off in  the box as a full time blow job if you are a movie purist virgin or  some stuff run quick but if you want to watch a lot of sex cum along  and enjoy the ride most say its painful but i say its long and hard  but fun to watch who knows maybe ill cum and watch the sequel in theaters
Mar 7 2016,negative,this movie is nothing but a flash in the pan no character development no conflict no nothing
Mar 6 2016,positive,this was actually better than i thought it would be lol i did not have high expectations it was pretty entertaining and shot very well with decent acting ridiculous sure but its a fun guilty pleasure regardless
Mar 6 2016,positive,not as bad as the book but nothing special either the actors seemed somehow fake and artificial
Feb 29 2016,negative,crap somehow worse than twilight i know how because its twilight fan fiction
Feb 28 2016,negative,can i give this zero stars  bad casting poor character definition horrible ending
Feb 26 2016,negative,could this thing be more boring no i dont even want to call it a movie i literally started to text in the movie theatre and i never do it
Feb 24 2016,negative,this movie is so  up
Feb 24 2016,negative,fifty shades of grey is an embarrassing excuse for a romance film and for a film in general while the technical aspects of the film such as the cinematography and original score are admirable they are completely lost among the putrid aspects of the narrative at hand leads dakota johnson and jamie dornan give it their all the former managing to be borderline adequate but they just cant find a way to create a sense of chemistry between these two dull characters completely lacking development the fanfiction origin of this story becomes apparent as the film progresses as characters spout off horribly written lines that often lead to cringing even the bdsm elements that the story relies so heavily on are too tame to be effective and become quite tedious once the film hits a dead end and has nowhere else to progress the plot to perhaps with a stronger source material with characters that actually have character arcs and chemistry this could work as a decent drama but unfortunately that just isnt the case with fifty shades of grey
Feb 23 2016,negative,literally the worst movie ive ever seen the acting on both parts if horrible and the connection is barely there this entire movie is him buying her things and her boobs and the ending is so obvious she falls in love and he says no wow what a twist seriously awful if i could go back i would use that 2 hours to do anything else
Feb 22 2016,negative,honestly it has been a long time since ive watched such a bad movie    the script is just  stupid and the dialogues even worse the characters are not believable i mean when you watch twilight you just swallow the whole thing because it is fantasy and  ok it is just a stupid vampires story but this is just toooooooo bad    ive not read the book but i suspect the fail is not just in the movie but that it is adapting something that is already bad from the beginning    the worst is that i kind of liked dornan in his role in fallen but this movie has made me realize what a short range of performing resources he has dakota johnson is not too bad though the acting is ok it is just that you hate such an stupid character    one more to my very narrow list of movies in which i have seriously thought stop watching by the middle of it i wasted the second hour too though
Feb 21 2016,negative,christian grey seems to be a psychopath he shows no emotions for ana and he just buy her stuff to show his love and she seems okay with it because shes dumb or something the movie sucks
Feb 18 2016,negative,this was the worst movie ever wow
Feb 17 2016,positive,loved it cant wait till the next one
Feb 14 2016,negative,sitting through this film was like watching a shakespeare play reenactment by costumed kittens  a professional dominant that falls in love with a cheeky virgin and constantly trembles in the knees around her is the least convincing lead character ive seen on screen in a decade  the disneyappropriate soundtrack doesnt help  neither does all the white wine drinking in the scenes that are supposed to build tension  the movie crawls at the pace of two turtles trying to cross the road and falling asleep in the process  its about as sexual as the notebook  youd be better off rewatching dangerous liaisons i hope you dont drink white wine while doing that
Feb 14 2016,negative,there arent enough positives to save this film  its a bit like watching a train wreck in slomo  with nude passengers despite the inevitable carnage one still hopes for the ride to end
Feb 13 2016,negative,lucky watch it free on cable not even worth 12 star just rubbish i actually want a refund for my time
Feb 12 2016,positive,similar to the book
Feb 9 2016,negative,its a simple nudity movie without some structure in her script
Feb 8 2016,negative,the whole reason the book is called fifty shades of grey is because of a catch phrase that they invented in the movie a very weird movie
Feb 7 2016,positive,todays forecast calls for record heat in this ballstothewall romance this film is not for the faint of heart but neither is viagra i would urge everyone to handle with caution   this film has proven to be the dominant in the box office and it will make audiences at home bend over too with the dvd release what is all the hype about well put your muzzle on and let me tell you you dirty pervert   anastasia steele is a young intelligent college student with an awkward nature that will melt your heart when her roommate falls ill on the cusp of a rare interview with the powerful christian grey anastasia reluctantly takes her place what transpires on that day changes her life forever  christian grey played by jamie dornan is not surprisingly a deep and perplexing character he is in good shape and yet you see him eating simple carbs and drinking wine throughout the movie the film does not insult your intelligence in this regard however instead it lets you infer that he is captain america how else can he run a multibillion dollar corporation maintain a physique to olympian perfection and most importantly court the elusive anna  at least onethird of the films eroticism comes from danny elfmans score the dulcet tones recall shades of pee wees big adventure which is another erotic masterpiece   in all i believe that fifty shades of grey will go down as the greatest family film in history just wait for the kids to bed and then call your cousins your aunt and uncle your mother her cousin and maybe even your grandpa just  make sure theyre old enough to watch the erotic hijinx ensue
Feb 6 2016,negative,with unintentionally hilarious dialogue terrible writing bad plot and just about everything being a disaster fifty shades of grey is nothing more than a porno with piss poor storytelling and dialogue though to be honest most pornos have better stories than this disaster of a flick best part were getting 2 more of these yay please dont waste your time with this movie
Jan 29 2016,negative,though the depiction of a bdsm relationship as solely abusive is ridiculous and the characters are bland cardboard cutouts some of this i actually enjoyed it makes fun of itself occasionally and can actually warrant a laugh visually this film is pretty well shot with balanced eye catching frames and beautiful visuals of the seattle landscape the soundtrack and songs were really tonally perfect though i didnt see the film as a love story so much as an offbalance depiction of an already degraded and misunderstood group of people
Jan 25 2016,negative,what did i just watch
Jan 25 2016,positive,want to see
Jan 22 2016,negative,this movie sadly is about abuse im going to keep this simple a woman telling a man shes fallen in love with her after she allows him to beat is not a good message for anyone and somehow the movie goer is to believe his massive torture chamber is a playroom for gentle spankings and feather tickling was ludicrous ana entertaining the slightest of abuse in hopes of expecting love in return was equally as bad as christians sick desire to hurt her two thumbs down for this twisted prince charming story
Jan 21 2016,negative,this movie is ridiculous a womans fantasy of doing anything for a rich guy christian is completely creepy and there is no chemistry between them
Jan 19 2016,positive,more like 50 shades of suck  im actually embarrassed that i watched the entire movie  shame    the only good part of this movie and by good i mean funny was when ana asked christian what butt plugs were  lolz
Jan 19 2016,negative,fifty shades is fascinatingly bad  its clear right from the getgo that a lot of effort went into this movie talented people were involved in making it  the opening shots of seattle are quite lovely and the music is nice and moody all things considered the movie looks and sounds great  but then the characters start talking and it all goes to hell  christian grey is one of the most profoundly boring characters ive ever seen in a movie  he talks like a robot with nothing interesting to say and every woman who gets any screentime cant stop talking about how hot he is as if that gives him character  he has a moderately interesting backstory involving some childhood trauma but then the movie tries to use this as an explanation for his controlling nature and fascination with sm which is offensive to both survivors of abusive relationships and people in the sm lifestyle all of whom by the way have disowned this story as bs  his decisions make no sense when in one scene hell tell anastasia to stay away from him and that hes not right for her and in the very next one hell give her some extravagant gift  either hes a manipulative dick or hes just a poorly written character and im not sure which is worse  anastasia steele isnt much better  i really have trouble saying much about her even shes your stereotypical clumsy shy girl but to such a degree my forehead became sore from all the facepalming it caused  and thats all i can say about her shes boring  her chemistry with christian is simply nonexistent  the erotic scenes they share have no hint of eroticism  things are happening that i recognize as supposedly sexy things but they simply arent sexy  truth be told i was more bored by the sex scenes than i was by the character scenes at least those could provide a few unintentional laughs  fifty shades of grey is like a porno with too much story and all the sex taken out as written by someone whos never had sex in their life and only has the loosest idea what eroticism is  the story originated as a twilight fanfiction which doesnt surprise me in the least but what does surprise me is that it was written by a middle aged woman when it feels more like it was written by a 12 yearold just learning what sex is  its a bad movie and an embaressment to sm sex and relationships in general  i will admit that it is very well shot the colors are nice and when the characters dont talk there are some very lovely moments  but you can cover a turd in diamonds but it will still be a turd
Jan 18 2016,negative,the script is so laughably bad the characters are atrocious the story is boring with the majority of the film about contacts and whether she will sign or not but then mr gray says to stop about the contracts  isnt redundant  yes that is what i have been saying the past hour and half and for a film about sex there isnt that much and when it is of a poor girl being beaten up and wiped while romantic music plays     dont waste your time with this piece of pornographic filth
Jan 16 2016,negative,i felt that anastasia steele needed a resounding slap and man the fuk up bitch intervention worse than the twilight series
Jan 15 2016,negative,im actually laughing because there are fans who hated this movie they claimed even the sexy parts were boring and in my head i was thinking how can you make the most interesting parts boring  well this movie so this is why im even giving this movie half a star aside from that lame at least everyone agrees
Jan 15 2016,negative,worst movie ive ever seen in my life wanted to burn my eyes out  as a woman i dont understand how any other self respecting woman would watch this or read the books considering she pretty much contracts herself for the sexual exploits of another person  disgusted
Jan 14 2016,positive,come on the books were outstanding the movie followed the book well  yes it was not as erotic as we all hoped it would be it was had a bit more class  that does not make a bad movie  the acting was great and if it had been as erotic as the books most of us would have been escorted out of the movie for inappropriate sexual behavior in public  try not biting your lip or heavy breathing or near orgasmic expressions as you read the damn book at the gym  its embarrassing when you realize youre doing it
Jan 11 2016,negative,it read like an erotic novel oh wait  the music was good though also happy that they toned down the ridiculousness but it was still very cheesy
Jan 11 2016,neutral,not a very good movie at all  the book was better the sex scenes were pretty toned down for the actual film  i remember leaving the cinema and there were a lot of disappointed people walking out especially the women
Jan 10 2016,negative,i cant believe i even rented this trash that even deals with s  m at least it didnt cost me anything except my time dont bother with this toxic waste of a movie
Jan 9 2016,negative,dakota johnson is charming at times despite abuse victim dom boyfriend but the script is obviously horrid and stale
Jan 8 2016,negative,well at least its better than the book seems to be the only positive comment ive been hearing about this movie but i disagree at least the ridiculousness of anas narrative her subconscious and the sex scenes in the book gave me a good long laugh god i wish i could insert quotes so i can only speak fondly of it i cant say the same for the movie summary it was eh slow drab with not very much of anything going on the kinky sex scenes what got this series famous in the first place not very kinky or sexy dakota johnson played the part as well as she could have i suppose and since james portrayed christian grey as a god walking among men in the book i think anyone would have disappointed ill give dornan some credit for not being as creepy as the christian in the book so if youre looking for sexy go elsewhere if youre looking for a good laugh you can go elsewhere too because as much as possible sam taylorjohnson removed all the weird in an attempt to make a decent movie but the funny thing is as much as we all ridicule this series we still read the books we still watch the movies feeding el jamess pockets and undoubtedly encouraging her work sooo that doesnt say very much about us either does it
Jan 8 2016,negative,i watched this movie even though i heard it wasnt great and yet everyone was right in saying it was terrible  a very boring movie that had bad acting and no story whatsoever
Jan 8 2016,negative,it was awkward what virgin has that much awareness so quick about her sexuality where she blindly gives it away and indulge in that type of relationship
Jan 8 2016,negative,provocative performance from the submissivegrey was as bland boring  colourless as his namesake suggests yepneexxxt ughhand me the bucket
Jan 7 2016,negative,wanna see something controversial watch cannibal holocaust wanna see a terrible movie watch dragonball evolution wanna see something darkly sexual watch basic instinct wanna be bored out of your mind 2 hours watch this
Jan 7 2016,negative,where to begin i could start with a pun like fifty shades of boring or i could start with a joke by saying ive seen more intimacy between a brick and a potato than the two leads either way fifty shades of grey that global phenomenon is an overlong hunk of sleezy junk about glorified abuse disguised as empowerment fifty shades of grey follows a young college graduate as she starts a relationship with a mysterious man for starters let me say that yes there is definitely more intimacy between a brick and a potato than there is between leads dornan and johnson it was well known that these two didnt get along on set but wow there is literally and i mean literally in the textbook definition sense of the word zero chemistry between them their lines of passion come of as extremely awkward which is perfect because the whole film is just awkward the sex scenes laughable the characters one dimensional laughable caricatures the writing laughably juvenile as for this being a story of female empowerment yeah not really this is about abuse because no female who feels empowered would ever sign a contract handing over her basic human rights while agreeing to be a sex slave really empowering stuff right there this all comes off as being overly critical but there isnt anything worth recommending in this film and the absolute worst part of all the film did gangbusters at the box office so now we have a new franchise
Jan 6 2016,negative,there was no slideshow on 50 different colors of grey
Jan 6 2016,positive,not sure what all the fuss was about seemed pretty vanilla to me   shrug   if ya like yer bdsm served up lame and tame this is it
Jan 5 2016,neutral,i dont know what all the fuss was about as it seemed much tamer than i had expected frankly if it aspired to be a teenage girls wish fulfillment fantasyit pretty much succeeded it did prompt me to look into criticisms of it from the bdsm angle  and i was left believing the more controversial stuff that was in the book was left out of the movie
Jan 2 2016,positive,you need an open mind to truly appreciate this film
Jan 1 2016,negative,the book was dreadful and this was only marginally better i thought it was nicely shot though
Dec 31 2015,positive,i love this film so eat it haters
Dec 30 2015,positive,such a great movie the book was even better a must see for a romantic movie night such a great love story
Dec 29 2015,negative,i spent most of this films run time wanting to kill myself now if that sounds like your ideal emotion while watching the biggest and possibly most offensive film of 2015 then please go right ahead and do both 50 shades of shit for those of you who have been smart enough to hide under a rock is the film adaptation of the book by the same name which hilariously became a trend a few years back now i havent read the book i dont intend on either but if this film is any indication of even a fraction of the books potential i truly believe there may be something wrong with the demographic which went ape shit for it the story follows a young english student who while filling in for her sick friend she isnt really sick she clearly just has a case of the cant be fucked falls head over heels literally for some twat with money now after a few encounters that would make any normal female run to the hills the twat and the girl then proceed to become invested in each other and while doing so she discovers that he likes to be a bit of a dominatrix and he wants her to be her submissive fill in the blanks for the rest you know them honestly there is no twists or turns just fill in the blanks so where do i begin with this boiling hot turd well lets start with the concept so fifty shades concept is that a man who has spent his adult life being into bdsm falls in love with a girl who is a virgin the rest of the material is about how they both try to change each other for their own personal benefit on concept alone if this is what we are condoning as respectable behavior what have we become and im not shunning the bdsm this is essentially packaged as a love story okay ill go with that fifty shades decides that love is something that can just be obtained by being hot and having lots of money and indeed that it is acceptable for men to be only attractive if they have a 6 pack a lot of cash in their back burner and decide to whisk you away from your friends in a helicopter if you cant tell by the sarcasm and disdain in my writing then i dont agree with this one bit so moving on to script is it good not in the slightest literally fifty shades has the clunkiest dialogue you will hear in hopefully quite some time there is nothing quirky or smart about it it doesnt ooze sexuality and even the referencing of sex sounds like it has been written by a 12 year old primarily unaware of what goes on in the bed room this is not helped by the fact that not only do mr twat and girl have zero chemistry but give 2 of the most stone walled performances i have seen by professional actors jamie dornan is an acceptable choice he is good looking fits the age range and of course if you had seen the bbcs excellent television show the fall you would understand solely why he was picked then again apparently not as he either cannot be arsed or the fall was just a fluke girl is played by dakota johnson and yet again she seems like the kind of person who the director is trying to cast but yet again its just painful to watch her try and do anything ill give them credit they both try and act the atrocious script out and god only knows how difficult that must be but seriously they are hopefully looking back at their careers and questioning this completely stupid choice this film is ball brakingly boring honestly its 2 hours and 10 minutes of just nonsense which it then has the audacity to sequel bate at the end i dont know anyone who will be interested in any follow up to this but if you exist go and throw yourself off a bridge the film just drags and drags and drags mainly between a will they wont they will they wont they will oh who fucking cares i dont feel sympathy for either party but if i had to choose it would probably be mr twat he openly and continually reminds girl about what he is what he wants and continually brakes and bends his own rules to cater for her yet she continually moans and groans about it not in a good way and tries to change who he is first of all didnt you hear him repeatedly tell you what he wanted and if you never agreed why on earth have you gotten this far into it he hasnt bullied her okay maybe stalked her but thats nothing a quick phone call to the authorities cant sort out it honestly doesnt make any sense why this continual situation needs to go on for over 2 hours of film time and by the looks of the ending even longer oh whoops i just spoiled it oh dear did you know that danny elfman produced the score for this no thats okay because i actually never heard a single song by him unless of course he was the one that remixed the god awful beyonce track and im highly doubting that i honestly could go on for days but i will not give this garbage any more of my time its overly long boring lacking any charisma it isnt sexy it isnt provocative it has zero emotional weight this film will no doubt find itself as a firm staple in a quantanamoesque style prison camp in years to come so if you were thinking about being a terrorist just think i may be subjected to this shit on a loop for days on end the thought alone is making my hand reach for a noose stay away
Dec 29 2015,positive,much better than the book for sure
Dec 28 2015,negative,dakota johnson oh i mean anastasia steele works at a hardware store before letting this stalker guy whip her 6 times because he bought her a macbook and they live in canada
Dec 28 2015,negative,it is not news that a book so viral with so many sales at the end of the day make a film about this i want to say that i did not read the book but in terms of adaptation and censorship i guess they had to cut too many sex scenes some extremely stupid so that this film would at least a rated r or c in mexico but in the end remember that i sat at the computer and i said to myself will see this film without the need to look for cons or intending to criticize but this not hard or 10 minutes the film is a total mistake first of all doesnt fit me in the head the idea that this movie is romance and love which isnt it because i only see a gloomy dark stupid full of sadomasochism or masochism atmosphere when women come to a sick man mental attraction do not understand it would be because it is a millionaire do you have luxury cars i have no idea fifty shades of grey tells the story of anastasia a shy virgin student who will interview christian flock for a work of her roommate the interaction of jamie dornan with dakota johnson is flat do not feel real anastasia always has the same face orgasm sadness orgasm anger orgasm  the relationship of these two is silly boring and uninteresting both characters do not provide anything about charisma become tedious and annoying for example   christian grey give away you a car a computer books and everything what your want to do you will be my submissive    anastasia no dont want to see you again spend 2 minutes i love you   for the love of god this movie is trash with regards to sex scenes they promise more than they are so do not go with the idea that sex scenes really extremely explicit and controversial    sam taylorjohnson does what it can in this film it is not her fault that the film would not work in fact looks to put all its effort to be at least passable fault history has it and of course the writer james sl a story boring nothing interesting mediocre and with little originality would forget to mention that this is twilight with sex all forgivable here is the soundtrack by danny elfman does will not be a masterpiece but it is the only decent thing has this film this is you can call movie this term does not fit here    review en español  no es novedad que un libro tan viral con tantas ventas al final del día realicen una película sobre esta quiero decir que no leí el libro ni lo leeré pero en cuestión de adaptación y censura supongo que tuvieron que cortar demasiadas escenas de sexo algunas sumamente estúpidas para que esta película lograra por lo menos una clasificación r o c en méxico pero en fin recuerdo que me senté frente a la computadora y me dije veré esta película sin la necesidad de buscarle contras o con la intención de criticarla pero esto no duro ni 10 minutos la película es un error total en primer lugar no me cabe en la cabeza la idea de que esta película es romance y amor el cual no lo es pues yo solo veo una atmósfera tétrica oscura estúpida repleta de sadomasoquismo o masoquismo desde cuando las mujeres ven a un hombre enfermo mental atractivo no lo entiendo sera porque es millonario tiene autos de lujo no tengo idea fifty shades of grey cuenta la historia de anastasia una estudiante virgen tímida que va a entrevistar a christian grey para un trabajo de su compañera de cuarto la interacción de jamie dornan con dakota johnson es plana no se sienten reales anastasia siempre tiene la misma cara orgasmo tristeza orgasmo enojo orgasmo  la relación de estos dos es tonta aburrida y poco interesante ambos personajes no aportan nada de carisma se vuelven tediosos y odiosos por poner un ejemplo  christian grey te regale un auto una computadora libros y todo lo que tu desees seras mi sumisa   anastasia no no quiero volver a verte pasan 2 minutos te amo  por el amor de dios esta película es basura con lo que respecta a las escenas de sexo prometen mas de lo que son así que no vayas con la idea de que veras escenas sexuales sumamente explicitas y polémicas   sam taylorjohnson hace lo que puede en esta película no es culpa de ella que la película no funcionara de hecho se ve que puso todo su esfuerzo para que al menos fuera pasable la culpa la tiene la historia y por supuesto la escritora el james una historia aburrida nada interesante mediocre y con poca originalidad olvide mencionar que esto es crepúsculo con sexo lo único perdonable de aquí es el soundtrack por parte de danny elfman no es que sea una obra maestra pero es lo único decente que tiene esta película esto se le puede llamar película este termino no entra aquí
Dec 26 2015,negative,a film surrounded with outrage turned out to be mostly boring despite a decent performance by johnson fifty shades of grey is as bad as we all expected
Dec 26 2015,negative,beyond awful cliched and wooden terrible dialogue and already looks like a bad tv movie from the 90s laughable
Dec 24 2015,positive,umm it is what it is really  bit slow
Dec 20 2015,positive,not as good as the book but still interesting
Dec 20 2015,negative,if i could give this film a 0 star review i would this film is horrible the acting the writing everything about this film pretty much represents what is wrong with hollywood and the film industry and the author of this book if you can call her that should not be praised for this horrible story a waste of time
Dec 19 2015,positive,i thought the film version was better than the book  i wished it had more depth but im hoping the next one clears that up
Dec 18 2015,negative,is it a great movie no is it great for late night watching and perving yes not a cinematic masterpiece but brilliant for some eye candy definitely for women and gay men if you are either one of these then i recommend mr grey will see you now will he will he really why hello mr grey how kind of you too see me wink wink
Dec 18 2015,negative,firstly im not quite sure how i feel about the movie in all honesty i have read the book and i can safely say the movie is far more toned down and hence more compelling to watch than it was to read yet i felt like the sex scenes were never quite sexy just really awkward and hence my confusion with this movie because when its not showing a sex scene the movie was actually quite comedic and dakota johnson kills it adding far more layers to the onedimensional ana of the book jamie dornan on the other hand can be quite wooden pun not intended okay maybe it was ha and doesnt necessarily catch the tortured soul of christian grey i mean lets be honest here the books are complete shit so theres not much working for the movie from the beginning and secondary characters are given about a minutes screen time each and hence totally underutilised its beautifully shot and welllit and props to the actors for being comfortable to strip down next to nothing but the movie lacks substance and doesnt explore the psychology of bdsm culture in summation i think dakota johnson was the highlight of this film and i hope she finds better work as she has the acting chops this review feels awkward sorry 25
Dec 17 2015,negative,what unique poop miscast afthough still better than the piece of toilet paper masquerading as a book
Dec 16 2015,negative,the least offensive sm film that couldve possibly been made and yet the most offensive antiwoman film that couldve possibly been made i havent read the books but my sense is that the whole e l james enterprise is a culturally bankrupt sad sorry mess
Dec 15 2015,negative,well lets just say curiosity never does quite kill the cat i actually sat through the uncut version whatever that means was this as bad as people described it as no am i deeply disturbed by christian grey yes is it because whips and chains dont excite me not at all were told to fall in love with him to sympathise with his somewhat cold exterior as if its a cute human flaw we can all grow to adore were supposed to root for him and anastasia to work things out but all i can see is a manipulative cretin that cant take no for an answer this reeks strongly if the tone of the movie was observing grey s attitude as wrong i could be more understanding
Dec 11 2015,negative,boring pathetic implausible crap  why
Dec 11 2015,positive,not long enough and the director made a shed load of mistakes cut esential scenes and added crap not nessasary thank god they ave replaced her for the next two
Dec 10 2015,positive,curiosity will keep you intrigued for the first half of the film and for someone who hasnt read the books that just might be enough to be satisfied thanks to the solid chemistry between the lead actors
Dec 10 2015,positive,rarely does a movie make me sit down and think afterward but this did  an intriguing and unique perspective on what is love but i conclude the moral of the story to be love is a twoway street
Dec 9 2015,negative,like and extended episode of red shoe diaries
Dec 7 2015,negative,this movie denigrates women
Dec 6 2015,negative,unwatchable dornan is an expressionless zombie johnson sold out wayyyy to early in her career the dialogue is a chimera of soap opera and porn it got 15 minutes of my life then i walked
Dec 6 2015,negative,i dont agree with those who say the performances were dull the material is just dull and stupid fifty shades of grey does for bondage and dominance what twilight did for the vampire genre        which means its corny and takes itself too seriously i think in anything the else the actors have potential dakota johnson especially does the best she can with what she is given to do while no i am not just talking about her being naked and moaning lol however making three of these movies wont do her career any favor
Dec 3 2015,positive,its addicting once you start watching you cant stop
Dec 2 2015,negative,love jamie dornan and he played the character wellbut his real accent kept coming through and there was literally no connection or chemistry between him and dakota
Dec 1 2015,negative,she was sexy thats it and thats all
Nov 29 2015,negative,fifty shades of grey is a laughing mess first the dialogue is uncomfortable and mostly boring as the acting of both leads is stiff ha secondly yes there is a lot of nudity but its hardly erotic until mr grey gets his tools out and even then its more shocking than appealing thirdly the soundtrack is unoriginal and out of place fourthly the movie drags on and many of the scenes feel repeated if the second film doesnt improve dramatically this trilogy is going to be brutal
Nov 29 2015,negative,if i want to see a xxx movie i would rather go ahead and watch that instead of this bullshit movie
Nov 27 2015,positive,much better than expected i enjoyed the books and thought the movie was a faithful interpretation of the first
Nov 27 2015,negative,didnt read the book and really wish i had not watched the movie
Nov 27 2015,negative,im not a prude but i was getting so bored that eventually i started fastforwarding through the sex scenes to try to get to the story but there was very little in the way of a story the ending was a big disappointment all in all a waste of two hours
Nov 27 2015,negative,for a supposedly erotic film with a bit of s  m on the side this is surprisingly tame and not overly erotic it is like watching 9 12 weeks but their fridge is defrosting i didnt find the film as bad as i was expecting but it is all a bit pointless nice innocent girl falls for a modern mr darcy he reciprocates but with a twist she toys with him and tries to change him he waivers but maintains his stance she throws a wobbly and leaves in between there a few tame scenes showing us some of his kinky pleasures blindfolding hands bound spanking and some whipping for a less romanticised look at this world maitresse the story of o and the image are far better and far more erotic
Nov 26 2015,negative,quite dull despite the subject matter    a young university student anastasia steele played by dakota johnson interviews a young billionaire christian grey jamie dornan  their relationship develops but it turns out his idea of a relationship is not that conventional    quite formulaic predictable pointless and dull  you would think that a movie that involves bondage and sadomasochism would have some level of intrigue and watchability but strangely it does not  for all its titillation it is quite lifeless and perfunctory      maybe its because the characters are not developed  maybe it is because the actors just seem to be going through the motions  maybe it is because this is really just a tad perverse romantic drama and even on that level it fails as it goes nowhere    no nothing good about this  avoid
Nov 24 2015,positive,welcome to my world    anastasia steele gets the opportunity of a lifetime when she gets to interview a young successful and eccentric billionaire christian grey  christian is a tormented young man due to a unique sex filled lifestyle that now leads to him living an eccentric and distant lifestyle  they instantly hit it off and christian asks anastasia to join him on his strange sex filled journey however anastasia is limited in her sexual experience and has never felt this way for a man before  will she cave in to christians sexual demands     im used to getting my own way  must be very boring    sam taylorjohnson director of nowhere boy delivers fifty shades of grey in her directorial debut  the storyline for this picture is very interesting unique and unpredictable  the conclusion is a bit abrupt and could have been done better but the characters themselves are fascinating and well executed  the cast delivers very solid performances and includes dakota johnson jamie dornan jennifer ehle eloise mumford and luke grimes    i dont make love i fuckhard    i recently saw this was added to hbohbogo and decided to give it a shot especially when my girlfriend was excited to see it  we found it very entertaining and fascinating  this was far from perfect but does have a unique feel and intensity  overall i recommend seeing this once if you dont mind the content    i heard hes gay    grade c
Nov 23 2015,negative,what a horrible movie i ended up chuckling to myself because not only because the acting was so bad but there was just no substance to it the women that made this book a best seller must really be lonely sad and unfulfilled horrible movie
Nov 22 2015,neutral,fifty shades of grey is one of those films i was curious about seeing i heard mostly negative reviews not gonna lie i gave it a shot watched a few nights ago im going to be honest this is one of the those films that might be my biggest guilty pleasure ever yeah i didnt mind the film this was actually good in my opinion acting is solidgood from the two leads this film is cheesy and i laughed a few times awkward moments in here yes definatly the cinematography was excellent the soundtrack is good fits the film i guess the character motivations are questionable but yeah thats all i gotta say im guessing this film is accurate to the source material but overall its a 35 stars a b
Nov 22 2015,negative,admittedly i have only seen the last 20 minutes but what a piece of sit
Nov 22 2015,negative,acting terribal    plot terribal  music not bad
Nov 22 2015,negative,dont waste your time if you have read the books
Nov 22 2015,negative,quite frankly this movie has very little going for it outside its book reputation dreadful script weak acting very little chemistry between the lead actors and sex scenes that are more amusing than anything elsein fact i was more excited opening my bag of minstrels   if you want to see this type of film see 9 12 weeks with rourke and basinger
Nov 22 2015,negative,well i finally watched it id read the book and it was just disturbing no not because of the content which is just normal erotica but by the horrendous writing  el james is a talentless hack  the popularity of this book is just sad on many levels  ladies there is much better erotica out there  in fact im quite sure i could write my own better erotica  in any case while the first 1520 minutes stuck to the book thats what made me almost turn off the ridiculous thing  seriously stupid dialogue with absolutely no character generation at all  just straight into it  however id like to at least point out the positives  one im so glad they used an actual writer for the screenplay  kelly marcel changed up quite a bit especially toward the end that made the movie pseudo tolerable  while jamie dornan had the arrogance down i expected a taller blonder more nordic look to christian  and while dakota played the timid girlturnedsubmissive quite well i honestly expected someone more attractive  yet given the crappy content they both made it work as best it could  i admit i liked the ending much better than the book as it leaves anyone enjoying the film yearning for the followup which was really the intent all along
Nov 21 2015,negative,this movie made me soft
Nov 21 2015,negative,i found the first 45 minutes of this film to be intriguing its very flashy and the actors are prettybut then it becomes more intimate and gets cheesy and silly and just sort of boring i suppose that straight housewives enjoy the mild kinkiness but really it just sort of comes across as an r rated made for tv movie of course i say this as a gay man who really doesnt appreciate the heterosexuality of it all i did like the soundtrack though
Nov 20 2015,negative,not nearly enough bukkake
Nov 19 2015,positive,i have readed the book before and the movie its exactly who ive readed it 
Nov 19 2015,neutral,great comedy woohoo   couldnt stop laughing   how is he considered sexy please enlighten me
Nov 18 2015,negative,one of the years very worst movies to everybody involved in this movie you should be ashamed of yourselves 05 stars
Nov 17 2015,positive,its inevitable to mention that fifty shades of grey is one of the best films of 2015 it was not as painful as everyone thought     undoubtedly jurassic world  star wars  avengers age of ultron and furious 7 marked path at the box office and critical overall but this year fifty shades of grey boosted by its valentines day release have been recordbreaking     globally this film has attracted attention for the exciting and strange love story between english literature student anastasia steele and billionaire businessman christian grey     the erotic trilogy of books left speechless the whole world and the film was not far behind its quality to capture every detail of the book in real life was more attractive to attract the attention of fans and nonfans     dakota johnson daughter of actors don johnson and melanie griffith she was pleased to execute the anastasia steele character she has done it a perfect way  showing virginity  innocence and sweetness of a woman who had never been in love she was about to graduate had the pressure of final exams had to jose hounding her and was about to go to a world full of dangers alone     jamie dornan after playing a serial murderer in bbc two the fall comes as a replacement of the first elected charlie hunnam  the question is  would have done much better charlie as christian  i doubt itjamie made an arduous and difficult work  fully achieve the character and that was evident     significantly relationship anastasia  christian was moderate and closely linked to aspects of the bestseller but the relationship dakota  jamie has fuelled speculation that the two stars can barely stand each others company so taylor  johnson responded openly    the films biggest single asset is dakota johnson gone is the books blithering simpleton      interestingly  despite controversy between sam and james  low public confidence in this project  the low apparent affinity between the main characters and the difficulty of bringing to the screen a book that revolutionized the world fifty shades of grey achievement to be one of the best films of 2015  so fifty shades darker  2017  will not have an easy road because sam will not direct the sequel james foley who will be in the directors chair     the films single biggest asset is johnson who has worked hard with marcel and taylorjohnson to perform a threewoman salvage job on the character of anastasia gone is the books blithering simpleton with her arsenal of holy hells and double craps and oh mys her inner goddess is thank goodness nowhere to be found or heard she is at no point a quivering moist mess and doesnt make the ruinous error of thinking the word f is an epithet     grey for obvious reasons is much more likely to anastasia for intimacy and mystery with which it has on the books     personally  this film from start to finish was excellent  showing an introduction of a fairy tale  a totally aggressive and an end that surprised us  e l james books are enigmatically catchers for the public but the film is undoubtedly the best of the best     the sex scenes are intense thermometer  which threatens to get red hot but not reach the topand with more participation dakota that what jamie you could say that the submissive from all angles captured is about to undress while the master is not sufficiently dominant achieving momentarily deflect the camera toward her even when grey with his riding crops and catoninetails and red room of pain would claim otherwise these sequences stay well within the bounds of vanilla mainstream taste     anastasia is no walkover here and sometimes gives as good as she gets if not better the funniest scene  debatably the sexiest too  has the duo sitting at either end of a glass boardroom table while ana whips through the contract for their experimental relationship scratching out everything she wont consent to the script isnt afraid to call a spade a spade here find anal fisting strike it out     its amazing boom that had the soundtrack of the movie taking on its lists ellie goulding  the weeknd  sia among others music is a quiet and elegant journey that distorts good way every erotic moment of the film making them much more tolerable to hear groans and hits constantly      the punishment of the inner goddess is very worrying and surprising  and the pain she feels  makes us mourn everyone  one two three four five six     the end of the movie is the best leaving an open end and shaking us all with a simple  no this ending is much better than the book     there are no more words to praise the project sex love drama  romance  controversy  music  fame  pen and other things around to fifty shades of grey
Nov 2 2015,neutral,its hard to think of another film in recent times which has caused more headaches for film fans than fifty shades of grey long before its release cruelly and cynically timed for valentines day the internet was flooded with more casting rumours whingeing fans and craven speculation about how raunchy it would be than you would get at a decades worth of comiccons in a frighteningly short space of time e l james trilogy has become allpervasive in our culture its been embraced overindulged parodied and run into the ground in everything from greetings cards to books about sheds    as film fans we always strive to wade through the augean stables of illdeserved reputation while many in the media are content to wallow in meaningless hype we aspire to rise above it and approach any given offering with a refreshing dose of perspective we may not always be the rivers that can wash away all the filth from said stables but youd be surprised what a few little streams can achieve in the case of fifty shades of grey the biggest surprise is not how far it goes on the contrary the films biggest problem is that both narratively and sexually its pretty tame    before we dive into the sexual politics of the film it is worth addressing the reputation of the film within a wider context an awful lot has been written about the book and the film purporting to encourage or condone abuse towards women something which can never and should never be excused for the sake of entertainment the concerns of campaigners like natalie collins who say that the film romanticised and celebrated domestic violence should be taken seriously we should not try to devalue or demean real victims of abuse just because their life experience doesnt gel with our attitude towards a piece of media equally however it is possible to have a positive experience of the film while being mindful of these concerns as well as noting those voices like star dakota johnson who believe that there is an emphasis within the story on consent and empowerment    people i have encountered who have read the book including my fiancee have led me to believe that anastasia enjoys more agency in the source material than is immediately evident on screen they hold that there are more sequences of her saying no to christian without it resulting in punishment with more emphasis being on the boundaries put in place by mutual consent this suggests that fifty shades of grey primarily fails because it is a poor adaptation rather than anything else certainly the final scene between our two protagonists is bizarrely cut short but considering the unintentional hilarity that results from much of the dialogue and its delivery i have a hard time believing that the book is a masterpiece by comparison    as with many films which tread the fine line between erotic drama and straightup pornography fifty shades of grey wants to market itself on the raunchiness of its sex scenes  and like most of these kinds of films it comes up short whatever is described in the book the fact that these kinds of scenes generated such a furore is more a damning indictment of how prudish our society remains than anything else the sex scenes in basic instinct or even goldeneye are steamier than anything here and in most cases they are better written too there is nothing that james attempts here that wasnt handled a hundred times better years earlier by the likes of d h lawrence and anais nin    no matter what the trailers would have you believe there isnt a great deal in fifty shades of grey which merited it being seen as a topend 18 certificate notwithstanding the false advertising on the part of the studio it is good that the film is at least trying to focus on drama and character development rather than just knitting together a series of sex scenes with pointless dialogue but all the scenes where flesh is present are shot all too tastefully with little full frontal nudity or associated swearing far be it from me to demand more flesh on screen in a culture already sexualised to the hilt but if a film claiming to be this risqué can be passed uncut then its clearly not worthy of its reputation    another big hollywood problem which lumbers the film is its lack of understanding regarding how sm relationships work hollywood has consistently misunderstood the dynamic of sm believing that the sadists job is to beat the living shit out of the masochist while the masochist just takes the pain and does what they are told regardless of whether they benefit the reality is that the submissive partner is always in control whether through safe words or prearranged routines and the pleasure is more mutual and evenly spread to this extent the film does rob anastasia of some agency we get the contract scene but too few other examples of her exerting the influence which she technically possesses    because of both its relatively tame sex scenes and its lack of sm knowledge the film fails to be a meaningful or compelling examination of sex and its role in relationships in my review of the look of love i said it is possible to make a film which will arouse an audience in more ways than one provided that said arousal is supported by a discussion of the issues that surround it but instead of using its reputation or characters as a means to discuss sexual issues the film just sits there giving us more of the same for an hour and a half without a clear sense of direction to its action this is to the look of love what the da vinci code was to the ninth gate wellmeaning incompetence rather than active contempt    much has been made of the fact that this film unlike basic instinct or other erotic films of note was scripted and directed by women sam taylorjohnsons debut feature nowhere boy had a lot of interesting features and screenwriter kelly marcel did a great job on saving mr banks but while its interesting from an industrial standpoint the film doesnt consciously reflect the talent behind it it still feels like a film made by a committee who were both afraid of hurting the fans and coy about the subject matter    despite marcels good work elsewhere the script for fifty shades of grey is downright risible some lines are laughoutloud poor such as ana asking what are buttplugs during the negotiation but most of the time the dialogue is laughable because of how inept and dull it makes the story both dakota johnson and jamie dornan are clearly trying to make something out of a script which gives them precious little in terms of character construction and little development outside of the bedroom but even then they seem awkward and lacking chemistry with all of johnsons lines being delivered in a irritatingly breathy whisper and dornan being inconsistent in his temper and charisma    one aspect of fifty shades of grey which hasnt been so widely discussed is its relationship to vampire fiction the fact that james work started out as twilight fan fiction has been picked up by many wanting to make a cheap joke about its quality or lack thereof but the connections run much deeper than this with both the book and the film having unintentional undertones which tie them very strongly to dracula    both bram stokers magnum opus and taylorjohnsons film have exactly the same character dynamic a rich aristocrat or other wealthy figure who preys upon poor vulnerable and virginal women in awe of him cementing a bond which costs both parties fifty shades of grey seems unaware of this comparison but because it fails to properly depict a balance of power between the characters these similarities do come to the fore the references to thomas hardy are also very telling tess of the durbervilles uses a similar dynamic of the rich cynical urban man having his wicked way with the simple rural woman in both a literal and metaphorical rape of the countryside suffice to say taylorjohnson doesnt attempt any detailed analysis of this and the film lacks the political depth that paul morrissey achieved on andy warhols dracula    with all of this taking into account you have to give taylorjohnson credit for what she has managed to salvage the film still looks very sleek with a cold metallic quality nicely contrasted by all the exterior shots full of foliage the soundtrack is pretty good too though annie lennoxs rendition of i put a spell on you is far more spellbindingly memorable than ellie gouldings contribution most importantly taylorjohnson strives to keep the characters central to the action even if the performances are not the most convincing we always get the impression that this is a film about people and not entirely about sex    fifty shades of grey is a surprisingly tame and somewhat disappointing adaptation which neither delivers when it needs to nor turns out to be sobaditsgood taylorjohnson strives to keep the characters central and tease out development and intrigue where she can but shes fighting a losing battle against poor dialogue flat performances and a peculiar coyness about the subject matter whatever happens with the sequels this remains a subpar effort which doesnt linger long after viewing
Nov 2 2015,positive,they tried to make a chick flick out of this  its ok much tamer than i expected  worst part was the lame ending but supposedly theres an alternate ending which i didnt get to see because i rented the dvd from redbox    if you like this sorta thing may i suggest secretary and from an earlier age last tango in paris
Oct 29 2015,negative,as much as i hated this movie i must also confess its a good representation of the overall relationship between men and women most of us hated this movie just like we hate a relative who keeps telling us how shit we are at everything it has very little  to do with how true their words are
Oct 28 2015,positive,a guilty pleasure if there ever was one
Oct 20 2015,negative,i did not like this move as it left a lot of gaps from the books if you want to see this move dont read the books first as you be very disappointed 
Oct 19 2015,negative,its disgraseful its shameful its disgusting and its one of the worst things anyone can see or read for that matter its a disgrace and should be ashamed for daring to even call itself a romance while its clearly not not only is it one of the worst films and books out there but its also a horrible influence towards women of all ages and all over the world telling them that it is ok to be tortured whipped beaten up and being sex experimented with but all for the sake of being with the one they are so stupidly crazyly in love with also after seeing how stupid women proved themselves to be and how horrible and abusive men are shown to be i just want nothing to do with love or romance seriously it just made me feel that i am way too smart to be in love    i would probably give it more credit if it had a good story with sex scenes that are shown in a more erotic way but with such idiotic characters and such stupid story and disgraceful message it gives ill have to say that twilight might end up actually being a better love story yes i said it twilight makes a better love story than this because aside from being also really stupid and also being a disgrace of a love story twilight at least had some sparks of romance at least in first two twilight movies the guy cares about his girl and he tried to protect and save her most notably in the first twilight movie that shows that the guy somewhat cared and calling it romance and love is somewhat justified  here the guy is an ignorant and abusive bastard who doesnt give a single crud about the girl at all because if he did he wouldnt do the sexual experiments on her at all he would treat her like a woman he loves which he doesnt also the girl is clearly stupid enough to agree to be abused for the sake of being with him and some point youd expect her to stand for her rights to say she doesnt enjoy it all or even call the police after that or even after finding out he did the same thing to a bunch of other women before her but she doesnt do anything about it sometimes making it worse for her  and dont get me wrong twilight is an awful series both film and book the characters are morons and they had some stupid s such as making the vampires glow in the light a whole bunch of other f however in terms of which one of these two is closer to what love and romance is im sorry but fing twilight got closer that had at least some elements of romance this is a shame and disgrace to even be called romance f that s  and just to make it all worse they had this released on valentines day a real slap no a real punch in the face towards true romance and love   also women are hypocritical when saying this movie and book are s why because they say its horrible while in actuallity once it came out they all ran into the theaters just so they can desperately see it    so overall this is another one of those things in life that are not suppose to exist yet it does and normal people believe me when i say normal have lost faith in humanity because of it and finding out it was sold well in both mediums it just make me want to do the same thing tom and jerry once did which is to sit down on train tracks and wait for the train to run me over because this is one of the proofs that it would appear that nowadays it is a trend to make a film adaptation of ever piece of crap that has been written whether people like it or not also just because the guy is handsome yeah i put it in quotes because i do not find him good looking at all doesnt mean the movie is good looks dont make the movie it is the talent good acting good directing and especially good writing that make a movie that can be enjoyable  this is one of those that has non of those things and considering that theres more of that s to come in about two years its enough for me to pray that women being disappointed after watching this crap got some human sense knocked into their heads which would help normal people to get this to disappear as soon as possible and be gone in a pit of obscurity with other bad movies like jurrassic park the lost world garbage pail kids the legend of the titanic and most movies that came in 2013
Oct 16 2015,negative,there are just some films that are not for me to watch ever but i love movies and i love ranting about bad ones but this movie oh this movie i dont know how to start seriously    out of curiosity i watched this movie and my goodness i got what i thought it was trash sorry that was bad but christian grey was too get it hehe theres simply no logic to this movie when i was watching this movie i kept asking my friend was she just dreaming about all this because seriously who would act like what she did who would react so blandly to supposedly extreme situations what smart woman would dare do what she did who wrote this story what did she take when she was writing this piece of blah    theres nothing to gain from watching this garbage i can picture my feminist friends going super saiyan 3 while watching this oh well if the writer or the director for that matter wanted to show that women lose their wit and fall helpless in front of a hunk however smart and subtle they are then they have succeeded in showing that big round of applause    i will never watch this movie again i even want to forget that ive seen this which is very easy
Oct 15 2015,negative,fifty shades of grey is a movie that both me and the wife wanted to watch together and we both were amazed at how ordinary this film was not in fact of all the strange things that mr gey wanted to do but on how the whole thing was a psychological mind game becuase the guy mr gey and both me and the mrs agree on this fact that he had some major childhood drama and some not conventional relationships that made him act the way he does now  we were disappointed and will of course watch part two to see how bad and worse this gets  not suitable for the kiddies and anyone that is not open minded
Oct 15 2015,positive,i watched this film not only because i am taking a course at my college msu which centers around it but also for the fact that i am mostly interested in movies with a romance theme i was not disappointed in fifty shades of grey although it touts a populist view of certain kinds of sex which has been shaped by the porn industry it doesnt do so in a particularly offensive way if you read the book and are expecting a xxx movie that slipped through the ratings discretely the hollywood rating system bestowed a much deserved r rating on this movie  the book on which the movie is based could easily have been serialized in playgirl magazine with much success i suppose to those partial to that kind of thing and the lack of the xxx sex scenes makes the movie seem like something is missing im beginning to think that this movie is a first step in pioneering a trend that was paved in literature by henry miller and james joyce and now has become de riguer in most recent publications of including at least one xxx porn description peter benchleys novel jaws even has just the one graphic sex scene and that scene could be used as script for a  porn movie much easier than speilbergs adaptation of the books violent parts  i dont know if this is a good trend for more quantities of more graphic sex to be included in popular entertainment but like violence it seems to be the path now followed
Oct 13 2015,negative,without its passion fifty shades of grey is just a bad performanced stupidly dramatized bdsm story
Oct 8 2015,negative,just like the book fifty shades of crap
Oct 7 2015,negative,didnt even finish it it was that bad
Oct 7 2015,negative,twilight fanfiction need i say more fifty shades of grey may have some nice camera work every now and then but it is nowhere near close to making up for the absolutely cringeworthy dialogue terrible characters and flaccid attempts to translate el james awful novel to film format
Oct 6 2015,negative,literally the worst film ive ever seen  the only thing that vaguely resembles wood is the acting 
Oct 4 2015,negative,lame nothing more than a softcore porno movie at best
Oct 2 2015,negative,nonsense film making  i have never seen an actor jamie dornan go through the motions like this before
Sep 30 2015,positive,ok the wife got me to watch it and its a decent movie did not read the books fyi and no interest to but the movie was good
Sep 28 2015,negative,i walked into fifty shades of grey not having read the book but knowing largely what to expect i didnt expect to love it but i walked in with an openenough mind that being said i was explicitly let down dakota johnson and jamie dornan are so stale i havent seen johnson in much but i have seen dornan in the fall and i know he is capable of delivering i fault the creative team that adapted the book to the film after all i heard i was surprised how dull the interactions between the two were and how tame the sex scenes were this movie shouldnt have been r if they wanted to hit that target audience full force they should have gone for nc17 the one saving grace here is the soundtrack the weeknd ellie goulding and sia all contributed stellar new songs in addition to classics by frank sinatra and the rolling stones it is honestly probably my favorite soundtrack of the year too bad its supporting one of the worst movies of the year
Sep 24 2015,negative,watch secretary instead
Sep 23 2015,neutral,yikes for all the hype it sure was a let down i expect so much more from dornan
Sep 23 2015,negative,i havent read the book but i dont think that should make a difference in being able to enjoy the movie of which i did not there is just absolutely no plot here i wouldnt even say the sex scenes which are supposed to be the hook of this movie werent very eyebrow raising its mostly an audience of repressed women i know i work at a movie theater that was predominantly the audience thats ok i guess but at least try to make it a little entertaining youre just making people waste their money i also had a bit of a problem that she was only he one getting beaten its the 21st century it should be a mutual thing if you like sm she should be able to be dominant  dont send a message to women that is how it should be i think the guy although pretty cute is a scoundrel and needs therapy in all reality something happened in his psychological development that went askew and he is pulling this poor innocent girl into this neurosis  i heard the book expounds on that whole thing but that is not my problem i dont care enough to find out and i already expended too much brain power on this boring movie
Sep 22 2015,negative,its basically skinemax with really high production value
Sep 22 2015,negative,every time i think about how much i like this movie all i can remember is that love me like you do song seriously its the only good thing about this movie it should have been so much better someone tell the writer they suck
Sep 22 2015,neutral,maybe im naive but i was hoping for a little plot  if you are looking for soft core sex in a mainstream movie you are in luck
Sep 21 2015,negative,so bad  i do not think i can say anything else about this movie to be fair i didnt finish watching it
Sep 17 2015,negative,christian  i dont make love i fuckhard    a movie full of kinky sex and dirty talk yet so painfully dull sums the whole movie up pretty welland some blind retards who called it a romantic movie need to first read and know more about domestic violence   because thats what it looked like to me  where a kind hearted soul is holding on to a relationship for the sake of hisher love and expectingread hoping to change the other person without that persons own will end up in only one thing  disasterwith quite a bit of tearsand this movie just glorifies that thing only    a big dud  watch only if you are a sucker for movies with sexual content but not brave enough for a hardcore porn   why did i watched it because one of my silly friends made quite a big hype about it and suggested it to me long time back before its release even 
Sep 17 2015,negative,the erotic romance novel that took the world by storm has now been transformed for the big screenâ or in other words people that arenât bothered to read the novel can feast their eyes on moving pictures yes this transition generated even more hype than the novel for fans are now able to actually vividly witness the erotic fantasies that tickled their fancy in the first place el jamesâ novel fifty shades of grey topped bestseller lists around the world has been translated into 52 languages and has defeated the negative feedback of critics and reached global popularity thanks to the people and this is essentially down to its controversial topic of bdsm bondage discipline sadism masochism but the real question is could the film adaptation replicate the same controversial sexual depictions on a visually less discreet level unfortunately fifty shades of grey is the biggest disappointment of the year and considering it is only february that is saying a lot there seems to be a shortage of the eroticism that made the novel popular perhaps taylorjohnson wanted to retain some female dignity despite the awful treatment of women but all in all this adaptation flops on every single level     fifty shades of grey revolves around anastasia steele a 21year old undergraduate at washington state university near vancouver washington due to her roommateâs inability to interview a wealthy 27year old entrepreneur anastasia agrees to help her out but as soon as christian lays his eyes on her her life changes completely christian seeks her out intently arousing the curious anastasia in the process but as they grow closer christian reveals that he cannot ever be in love as he prefers controlled bondage anastasia is more curious than disturbed but how long can she really live this fantasy and not experience the true darkness of christianâs cravings     christianâs interest in a subculture relationship where he can be the dominant and ana the submissive allows the film to explore the territories of controlled bondage however the lack of bondage is alarming for a film that sold itself on the disbelief of its perverse love story ana and christian actually make love at first straight after revealing that he only âfucksâ and at this point you wonder if youâre watching the right film after this rather unexpected moment there are only a handful of bondage scenes to choose from and then again they are so unrevealing and brief that just because sexual tools are being used doesnât mean it will heighten the sexual intensity by what fifty shades tells us bondage is simply tying a person up with whatever you can find and punishing them like a child it is pretty sad viewing because there is no meaning behind the story sexual fiends like grey should not be allowed a place in cinema if fifty shades were sexually gratuitous then it possibly would have been fine because its fame is indebted to that but because taylorjohnson attempts to find the love in something so unloving makes fifty shades of grey such a confused film that doesnât know how to express itself there is hardly anything for us to call the film a sexual thriller as even the music is used at wrong moments especially the sexual ones the song âearned itâ by the weeknd is perhaps the only song that deserves its place within the movie for its sexual overtones are immense but it is used for a car journey fifty shades of grey is so unsexual that you can describe basic instinct as a whole lot worse but last tango in paris puts this film to shame     dakota johnson stars as anastasia steele the literature student whose sexual life takes a whirlwind evolution first of all johnson deserves kudos for even wanting to be shown to the world as a sex slave and secondly she is the best thing about the film she captures the vulnerable innocence of ana at the beginning but as she is enlightened to this whole new world she develops a tough side under that susceptibility of hers that makes the story far more interesting than it should really be jamie dornanâs erotically extreme christian grey is perhaps the most depraved character to appear on screen in the past few years dornan may have the physical appeal to fill the role but he seems too robotic to play the desirable pervert as he fails to offer any sort of dimension to his personality everyone else donât matter because no one really knows what their relationship is about but the shocking cameo from rita ora requires a mention for she now has two films to her name with fast and furious 6 already as cringeworthy as you can get she wasnât even a singer until a few years ago how dare she think she can be an actress too     fifty shades of grey suffers terribly from the awfulness of its script characters are introduced but we donât really care about them or anything they do the relationship between ana and christian is irritating because it needs more moments of conversation they hardly speak and this forces us to deduce their relationship based on the acting and the acting isnât that good so weâre hopeless passengers that are unable to identify with the story scenes are also overlong and fruitless in grabbing our attention all we want is to see and be shocked by the eroticism that has gripped the world but fifty shades of grey promises to deliver only 20 of your wildest expectations you begin to question what is the point of this film as christian just wants someone beneath him so he can smack her and do all sorts whilst she falls in love with his ways but at the end he smacks her one smack too far and then that is it at the close of an elevatorâs door it endsâ the film is a complete waste of time nobody should bother seeing unless you want to be dissatisfied     just because fifty shades of grey tells an intensely sexual tale doesnât mean the tale is worth telling it goes to show that our society desires a sexual edge to everything fifty shades of grey the novel may have been seriously steamy to generate a global hoohah but the film has destroyed any sort of popularity the book had as it was too unsexual to not disappoint grossing over 527 million just a few weeks since its release demonstrates how its popularity has attracted peopleâs curiosity yet it also discloses the tonnes of people the film has let down this is down to the fact that the director and author clashed a lot on how the film should be executed taylorjohnson has proven that she was not up to the task as she poorly utilises the source material causing her to end up with something that lacks any sort of sexual bite to have an impact fifty shades of grey is the most hyped up film of the decade and boy did it let everyone down     the verdict     utterly underwhelming to say the least fifty shades of grey is a droning sexual affair that has failed to live up to its overhyped buildup     ââââââââââ        210
Sep 16 2015,negative,not the disaster i was expecting and surprisingly well directed but theres still no story here or characters made of anything other than cardboard the sex scenes are standard cinemax softcore stuff i guess the aspect of the movie that stands out the most is this is fantasy porn for women and made for the female perspective which is in itself sort of rare fifty shades of grey is the male equivalent of all of the movies that regular dudes get a highly beautiful or interesting woman interested in them as a matter of routine i guess the movie gets points for not being the norm but thats about all i can positively say about it besides being competently directed and being a merely meh movie the two main characters are both terribly boring and as theres very little plot or story to speak of it makes for a very plodding character piece
Sep 16 2015,positive,if youre a fan of ironic humor this is definitely the movie for you its so bad its fantastic there were moments when i legitimately laughed out loud hysterically much to the annoyance of everyone else in the theater     if you enjoy laughing at bad movies look no further than this
Sep 15 2015,negative,this movie is just terrible this movie suffers from cheesy dialogue a terrible script and characters that you dont care about this movie does have a good performance from dakota johnson who is good to look at but her character is  boring  and just has nothing interesting or caring about her same thing goes to the male character who was in this movie who was boring and not interesting the actors performance was just okay for me to notice but i didnt really care because his character was just dull overall this movie was shot well and had an exceptional performance from johnson but the movie suffers from characters with no meaning plot holes and a terrible script even though the dialogue was terrible i still had a good laugh
Sep 15 2015,negative,the ironic thing between the visit and fifty shades of grey is that while i didnt really want to see the visit i actually wanted to see fifty shades of grey only to see how hilariously bad it can be so i rented it with my own money and watched it only to realize that not only did i regret paying my own money for this movie but i also regret watching this terrible film lets get to the good stuff already dakota johnson is really good and brings out some of the humor from the dumb lines that she says the soundtrack by danny elfman is really good which i was actually looking forward to that in a good way and it didnt disappointed me  the shots for the movies are good including the sex scenes and thats all the good stuff i can think of jamie dornan is terrible and just bland in this film i was looking forward to seeing singers like rita ora act in this but she was very underused which was pointless that she was even in this i was very disappointed of how the script went but i dont blame kelly marcel for it because i heard some sources that she was very disappointed of what the final result of the film was and there were a lot of disagreements between her and the author herself the writing is very dull with not much laughable lines in there the chemistry between anastasia and christian is terrible and doesnt seem to be going anywhere the plot is awful as there isnt a plot at all i was curious to see what the sex scenes are like as the book is famous for those and the terrible writing but the sex scenes are very safe and just very standard the characters are forgettable although one of the things i hate is that the movie portrays women very negative in that in order to get the man she want to be with she has to surrender and weaken herself to the man do what he says and if she keeps it up thats when she gets him the ending was so brief and so terrible that i was just glad that the movie is over its been a while for me to be sick of a movie as while fifty shades of grey is not the worst film ive seen its definitely one of the worst romance films i have seen its actually a bit worse than twilight which astounds me to a degree and when theres going to be sequels coming up im gonna be groaning as im probably going to watch them too
Sep 13 2015,positive,i seen it an i own it i love the music    he needs to be a bit nicer i hate when he punishes her cause he had a bad life she didnt sign the contract so he had no rights she said how they love each other he dont have a heart to love anyone she loved him his past is what messed him up
Sep 12 2015,negative,poor casting of christian everythings else fails due to that huge miss
Sep 12 2015,negative,makes you feel ashamed not just because of the source material but because you realize you are wasting two hours watching a movie about nonexistent characters and pointless plot points it is about as artistic as putting a fork in a blender and about as enjoyable as putting your hand in with it    i hate this movie
Sep 9 2015,positive,very good movie can not wait for the next two
Sep 5 2015,positive,i loved the movie looking forward to fifty shades darker
Sep 5 2015,negative,kind of interesting but i did not care for it
Sep 5 2015,negative,50 shades of why the fuck did i watch this movie    tommy wiseau and lisa had more fucking chemistry than these two    i nearly cried of laughter when this song was playing during the helicopter ride this movie was almost worth the watch because of that scene alone quite possibly the cheesy moment ive seen in cinema of alltime it was truly hysterical
Sep 2 2015,negative,fifty shades of grey is more or less a poor movie nonetheless one cunningly trashy enough to make me wonder why it couldnt be more exciting or interesting or even sexy
Sep 2 2015,negative,so many wtfs in less than two hours
Aug 31 2015,negative,dull uninteresting and poorly acted and horribly scripted fifty shades of grey is one of the worst movies of the year and one of the worst movies in recent memory
Aug 29 2015,neutral,the movie was made by the scenes of seattle reminded me when i lived in wa state it reminded me of the whole gloomy state and the music is amazing that it made the movie other than that i cringed at some of the lines and of course it was soft p because the book is horrible not even a movie can save it
Aug 28 2015,positive,probably received low ratings because subject matter embarrassed theatre goers  seen on the small screen the movie can be better appreciated  dakota johnson pulls off a bravura performance  its very suttle and most viewers probably miss the fact that ana is in charge most of the time sure christian looks in charge but consider he never leeps with anyone  yet the first t2 times with ana he sleeps with her  christian never makes love  he fcks yet the first time with ana he makes love  everything he says he never does he does with ana  she brings out in him the hidden desire for love  in the opening interview she challenges him on every point and forces him to examine his positions she frustrates him at every turn finally when the ten minutes alloted for the interview are up he cancels the next interview to spend more time with her     dakota nails every facial expression and nuance of the script to perfection her performance is extremely demanding for a young woman haveing to appear nude and show an intimate side of herself that few actresses could do  i salute her for her near perfect timing and gracious efforts
Aug 28 2015,neutral,thankfully i didnt read the book or this film would have been much more of a disappointment than it was  the filmmakers should have went with a nc17 rated film to do the story justice what the r rating left us with was a mostly vanilla bdsm story that bored most 21st century savvy audience members cdw
Aug 26 2015,negative,just when i thought id never see an instance where i couldnt say still a better love story than twilight here comes fifty shades of shit
Aug 26 2015,negative,a film that is so cheesy over the top and badly acted that you have to laugh at it  it is one of those films that unlike fantastic 4 that is so fun to watch because how awful it is   it is a two hour commercial with two attractive people attempting to sell this outrageous relationship   us guys have our super hero movies i guess this is what women havewe all need our own escapism right
Aug 25 2015,positive,it was the feel good romcom of 2015
Aug 25 2015,negative,at the end of the day its fifty shades of grey anyone going into this movie should know what to expect only spared by the soundtrack cinematography and even a few acting performances fifty shades of grey like its female protagonist is a slave to its erotic source material
Aug 25 2015,negative,dull tedious poor pacing  seems a whole lot of nothing do not bother watching unless you are a fan of the books
Aug 25 2015,negative,laughably bad perfect for drinking games
Aug 23 2015,negative,super awkward with such bad actingi wouldnt recommend watching it sober
Aug 23 2015,positive,not as good as the book but worth seeing anyone who hates the movie probably never read the book definitely worth the cost of a dvd rental
Aug 23 2015,positive,i really enjoyed it and thats good enough for me
Aug 23 2015,negative,2 hours of my life i will never get backwhy did i bother
Aug 23 2015,negative,what a load of    very disappointing a boring film which was pretty much the same the whole way through for 2 hours
Aug 22 2015,negative,basically a montage of sex scenes with no plot whatsoever
Aug 22 2015,negative,if someone told me to describe 50 shades of grey with one word id say boring the characters were boring the sex scenes were boring the plot was boring the performances were weak and boring 50 shades of grey belongs to the club of movies that you will watch only once the sex scenes not only are boring but there are not even close for a r rating these are pg13 sex scenes i dont see any strong sexual content as the rating says the rating mislead us so we can watch it only the soundtrack works for this film 
Aug 20 2015,negative,this movie hurt me in all the wrong places triggered ptsd that i got from the book a childlike fairy tale for sheltered children
Aug 20 2015,negative,this movie was horrific i read all three books twice and loved them but this movie missed the mark big time both the main actors delivered whinny childlike performances chirstians  physical appearance was not even close to what was described in the book nor in my head he should of been so attractive that the majority of women who saw him would swoon on spot not a scrawny nerdy child they chose the movie was rushed and hustled along with out a second thought it seems there was no build up or 4 play in the sex scenes at all you have no hint to what is going on in there heads which is a huge part of the book because lets be honest they cant act worth a shit there is not chemistry between these two i would love my money back or better yet try again hollywood just pretend this movie never happened and so will i
Aug 18 2015,negative,utterly dumblike watching a clown drink himself to deathall hypeno substanceabout as much plot as a pornobut wo the sex scenes 2 make it worth your timeif u like idiotic conversationsabsurd stereotypesboring sex this is the movie 4 uthe sheltered cul de sac typesexcellent sleep aidzzz
Aug 18 2015,negative,does a 2 hour long sex montage constitute a movieno it really doesnt
Aug 18 2015,negative,basically just a porno from the director the writer the production quality to the music and the acting

Aug 11 2015,negative,atrocious watched this against my better judgement and there was literally nothing redeeming
Aug 11 2015,positive,the dialogues are rather bland and the plot is a tad predictable but overall the suspensebuilding is quiteamusing
Aug 11 2015,negative,best thing about this film soundtrack music was definitely better than the film itself i really was expecting something more i guess disappointing modern fairy tale about being sex slave to young hot billionaire without character banal dialogues unrealistic plot boring
Aug 10 2015,negative,the controversy was the theory which is only a romantic comedy with breasts the laughter comes involuntarily truth be told unfortunately you can not take seriously dornan and his inespressivo face dakota johnson is a good revelation
Aug 10 2015,negative,yes i had heard the hype around the books no i was not interested in seeing the movie after perusing a couple of pages and slamming the book shut it really is just cheap erotica i had hoped that the makers of the film version of fifty shades of grey would attempt to improve on the source material i was hoping it wasnt as bad as people said it was those people are also not fans of the series my suspicions were confirmed fifty shades of grey is every bit as awful frustrating angering and unromantic as i thought it would be     director samtaylor johnson whose teen john lennon meditation nowhere boy i enjoyed very much is able to inject some style into certain scenes with some help from the production design and the director of photography and on the plus side the soundtrack is nifty     however the movie does not work if you dont have the right people playing these characters and though dakota johnson and jamie dornan are talented attractive individuals they definitely look good naked and physically can get through a sex scene passably they are totally wrong for these parts there is no chemistry to go along with the heat however little heat there is their discomfort with the material is evident from the beginning johnson unintentionally plays up anastasias awkwardness and sadly a lot of the supposedly romantic scenes become funny in a bad way jamie dornan on the other hand is not awkward he unfortunately enhances christian greys creep factor with all of the menace of a psychopathic yuppie out of american psycho and only paints an even worse picture of the character than i already had     but thats not the actors fault the blame really lies on the source material and kelly marcels insufferable script which comes loaded with cringeinducing dialogue fifty shades of grey is not romantic in any way it is not a hot steamy love story for the modern age what the filmmakers and the writers refuse to admit is that the interaction between mr grey and anastasia steele is ultimately abusive and manipulative nobody is in love here its one giant sm fantasy that author el james and screenwriter marcel should have done more research on
Aug 9 2015,negative,it was better than the book but that isnt saying much i read the book to see what all the fuss was about and i watched this to see how the hell they were able to make it into a movie without it just being porn the answer is a lot less sex christian grey seems like less of a psychopath in this than the book but he is still in my opinion an abuser i also still dont buy the relationship between him and anastasia i just dont believe a women would go from being a virgin to being in a bdsm relationship just like that one welcome change is that you do not hear anas thoughts constantly hearing about anas inner goddess in the book got on my nerves
Aug 9 2015,positive,i didnt read the original book however as a movie it is quite enjoyable
Aug 8 2015,positive,yup i saw this movie and i have no regrets while everyone knows whats up with the book and no i didnt read it but did got the gist of what its about its just that while the story was interesting the sex scenes were there but in brief yet romantically and visually i guess those parts played a big role and its not like other movies where the two people just engaged in sex because theyre attracted to each other and all that stuff blah blah blah this movie was exploring deep not the sex but the relationship between grey and ana theyre at a different wavelength but while more in the same zone this movie can be interpreted in so many ways but i really think its showing how two people have more than one trouble not each other but for themselves as well greys characteristics tells me that he doesnt want what ana wants and something or someone is preventing him to do so this kind of story isnt the first thing down the line there are similar stories out there that shares similarities in a situation that grey and ana are having  and some of those stories didnt end well suffice to say this movie was actually interesting and it has some cheesy and weird moments it really focus grey and ana a lot and of course the characters were treated just like any other supportingmiscellaneous characters in a typical formula of creating a story but thats okay im totally okay with that i didnt realize that this movie was a planned trilogy when i found the book has two more so i guess ill find out myself what happens next since i irrevocably started it
Aug 8 2015,positive,so hottt hot hot hot
Aug 8 2015,neutral,the actors can only put so much effort towards a crappy script
Aug 6 2015,positive,i enjoyed this immensely its very shady and keeps you guessing and enthralled his personality is violent and intense
Aug 5 2015,negative,probably the dumbest movie i have ever seen what a waste of 2 hours
Aug 5 2015,negative,another complete disappointment  waste of time and money
Aug 5 2015,negative,this movie gives sm a bad name unfortunately from the way it ended and the book there will be another drivel of a sequel to this dont know which is worse the acting the stupid dialogue laters babe or  everything  least the soundtrack is interesting
Aug 3 2015,positive,book is much better after reading a book i expected much more from the movie a lot of missing details that was in the book and worth showing it in the movie
Aug 2 2015,negative,quite possibly the worst movie ive ever seen i couldnt even finish the whole thing its just two solid hours of a look inside the life of a poor innocent girl and her relationship with a sadistic abuser
Aug 2 2015,negative,nothing like the books disappointed
Aug 2 2015,positive,good attempt at a film version the actors had decent chemistry onscreen making it funny yet believable

Jul 31 2015,negative,its twilight without the vampires and werewolves but with nudity
Jul 29 2015,negative,i gave myself a headache from rolling my eyes too hard
Jul 28 2015,positive,im not gonna lie i went into this film with the lowest possible expectations but upon viewing it in the cinema i would go as far as to say that this is nothing less than a cinematic masterpiece at first i felt a bit uncomfortable watching the sexy bits with my nan sat  next to me but as the film progressed i started to care less and less about the old hag and accepted my awkward arousal i proceeded to cum in my pants but i didnt care this film is life changing and my nan can fuck off if she thinks shes gonna stop me from having this wonderful moment of pure bliss would definitely love to see this again hopefully in an empty cinema so i can pop my man meat out and blow my load all over the rows in front and would recommend everyone who hasnt seen it yet to do so now
Jul 27 2015,negative,rich guy seeking to sexually abuse and humiliate young inexperienced college student i dont understand how any strong woman can find this as anything but offensive repugnant and revolting  why does he get all the power and women give in so easily for a pretty face this is not a romance but once again proving how weakminded and weakwilled women are perceived to be
Jul 26 2015,negative,awful the movie was better written than the chemistry with these two and if you guys read the book youll know what i mean
Jul 26 2015,negative,just like what they did with tattoos soccer moms will make porn uncool because of this movie
Jul 24 2015,negative,about as bad as i expected and i refuse to believe its not a straightup comedy on how its delivered jamie dornan is of big of a vapid void as ive ever seen it looks sleek and polished aesthetically so at least its got that
Jul 23 2015,negative,no one watches this movie for its cinematic value or aesthetics purely for the semienjoyable smut it wasnt an awful movie it just wasnt good
Jul 22 2015,negative,there is literally no plot in this movie and if this guy was not rich he would have been arrested about 8 times utter disappointment
Jul 22 2015,positive,loved the books  this first start of them is amazing i cant wait for other two movies 
Jul 22 2015,negative,2 hours ill never have back
Jul 22 2015,positive,if you watch this movie and watch jamie dornan its a completely new experience  he does an amazing job with his range of emotions while trying not to show them  very much a christian grey move  its very beautifully shot and fun while being sexy  personally i think peoplecritics wanted this to be bad so they decided it was before ever even watching it  watch this movie again sometime  keep a close eye on mr dornan  hes good
Jul 20 2015,neutral,it could be much better with this kind of material its a big loss that they didnt execute it in an oustanding way
Jul 20 2015,positive,the wait was worth it the castes it perfectly the beginning they left a lot out but that happens a lot with books going into movie form i enjoyed it stellar soundtrack
Jul 20 2015,positive,not what i expected totally but was so romantic in the end
Jul 19 2015,negative,how many times can christian say im not into the boyfriend thing seriously if they took that sentence and variations of it the movie would be half as long
Jul 19 2015,negative,a crappy script covered with high budget sweeping shots the two main characters had no chemistry and they decided it wold be fun to glamourize an abusive relationship ethics aside its still a terrible film you cant polish a turd even if that turd is regrettably on new york times bestsellers list
Jul 19 2015,positive,theres only so long one can shy away from discovering what all the hype is about and i must say i can only assume the book must have been some read to generate this much talk as the film is relatively average not having the patience or desire to get my head stuck into the book i opted for the visual presentation which could surely create a more gripping engagement with its audience through all the seduction eroticism and sexual tension that was portrayed the relationship between the two lead roles was this movies greatest asset the inquisitiveness and innocence of one against the dominance and bluntness of another watching her sweet mind pick holes in this mans seemingly impenetrable need for control was intriguing resulting in him slowly questioning his desires in the bedroom could she shape him into the man she wants or would he get his way as always  that was the question which i was tuning in to find out the graphic nudity was not as arousing as the book may have portrayed perhaps leaving some disappointed it was also very repetitive the first encounter involved some sensual stripping of one another but so did the second and third and fourth scenes there was the odd moment of wham bam thank you mam inbetween but it was certainly the verbal interaction that took the forefront over the physical side the conclusive scenes of ultimate punishment were somewhat anticlimactic after she received a couple of strikes with the belt but i like to think that that was just the lead up into the second film rather than the poor ending of the first yes im glad ive seen it if purely for the fact that i can now join in every conversation women are having in the workplace or outside it most appear to have similar opinions to i by way of this being a minor let down but in fairness theres not much more this showing could have done without turning it into tasteless pornography it was well acted well built up and the dialogue between the leads gave this a great deal of credibility there was clearly barriers to how far this film could actually go and it has possibly suffered from the over erotic literary content that has got womens expectations and juices flowing too freely
Jul 19 2015,negative,this is the tamest kinky movie ever unrated cut watch only if you take masochistic pleasure from being bored to tears
Jul 18 2015,positive,simple plot and some of the dialogue is barf but they did a surprisingly good job given what they had to work with
Jul 18 2015,negative,this is probably one of the worst movies ive ever seen the only positive of this film is the cinematography the entire film is just straight boring i almost fell asleep a couple times the acting isnt that great the actors dont put any emotions in their character their just boring and not that interesting the chemistry between jamie dornan and dakota johnson doesnt work if dakota johnsons character doesnt like what mr grey does to her then why didnt she just leave him in the beginning instead of waiting dakota johnson has the potential to be a great actress but she needs to be in the right movies the writing for this movie is laughable and very cheesy there were some parts that i laughed because the lines that were delivered were so bad that i had to laugh at a lot of people were defending this film by saying most of the stuff in the film were in the bookthen why was it in the book in the first place fifty shades of grey is so far one of the worst films of 2015 so far and probably one of the worst films ive ever seen
Jul 18 2015,negative,i put off seeing this film because of the hype and my wife and a lot of women crazing over it i finally gave in and watched it i feel the film is rush the girl is in love with mr grey after around 2 minutes of the film and a story never materialises i feel the character is far fetched and appeals to a female fantasy rich successful good looking good physique then can suddenly play the piano and fly helicopters all in all very strange i would say though i felt jamie dornan played the lead very well as it was a tough job to do with all the hype
Jul 16 2015,positive,like your xbox and stuff
Jul 16 2015,positive,i thought the movie was amazing very true to book honestly when i saw the trailer i was really disappointed i thought the choice of both main characters was way off i know we all imagine things very differently but either way apparently i was very wrong it was entertaining and sexy i think all the bad reviews are from people who did not read the book which was dumb and its not for everyone like uptight prudes or when you are watching with family
Jul 15 2015,positive,pretty mucho liked it
Jul 13 2015,negative,dumpster fire that is all
Jul 13 2015,negative,awful like basic instinct remade by people with no sense of humour some of the worst dialogue ever to appear on film and no narrative or plot to speak of
Jul 13 2015,negative,ok the movie wasnt the worst thing ive ever seen but it became something of a joke christian as played by jamie dornan seemed like a pedantic little geek from high school who never got laid but now has a lot of money and is trying to get laid as much as possible perhaps trying to make up for lost time dakota johnson is cute thats about it she didnt seem to portray anastasia as in the book i agree with other reviewers that there simply was zero chemistry between the two making for a long banal movie
Jul 13 2015,positive,love love loved it i cant wait for the next movie
Jul 13 2015,positive,haw do i watch the movie
Jul 12 2015,positive,gr8 mix of slick photography and good music
Jul 12 2015,negative,boy meets girl girl meets boy boys wears gray a lot nervy and gaga girl prances around boy in gray boy tries to convince girl to enter sm relationship girl balks boy keeps trying girl balks boy keeps trying girl balks lots of sex in between though boy says anastasia from outside elevator girl says christian from inside elevator film ends  mercifully
Jul 12 2015,negative,dull boring and apparently much better than the original book  there is no character depth and no chemistry between the main characters
Jul 12 2015,negative,this was a horrible movie the hype was not worth it
Jul 12 2015,negative,terrible predictable boring
Jul 11 2015,negative,dishonest juvenile and plain not even titillating for 1986 when 9 12 weeks was released  who cast this dude in this movie
Jul 11 2015,positive,this movie was so much more then sex
Jul 11 2015,positive,the movie is ok in it on way but the  book is better in more ways they should have another director the that will go a little closer to the  book
Jul 10 2015,positive,i think it was a good movie although it didnt show a couple parts from the book it still followed good and i think the actors were perfect for their spots
Jul 10 2015,negative,it really wasnt that good i got roped into watching it and the plot was slow unrealistic and it wasnt as graphic as it was hyped up to be
Jul 10 2015,positive,true to the book but still not my cup of tea
Jul 9 2015,positive,i hoped for more of a story hopefully the next one will dive more in to the characters not just the bondage but good movie
Jul 9 2015,neutral,okay the acting was good dakota jonhson has a lot of potential the music danny elfman what was also good the cinematography wins story so very nope overall it isnt good definitely not great but for not many reasons a bit worth a shot
Jul 8 2015,negative,for a movie that takes itself very seriously this movie is downright hilarious
Jul 8 2015,negative,i did not read the book      i rented this movie  trash  i dont know what women see in this movie  i hope the book was better  it usually is  my only guess is they had to mute the really good stuff women wanted to see    dakota is supposed to be like 21  she looked 30 something  not sexy as all    utterly boring and pointless story  i have read some things about this sub master world and it is nothing like this  if this is what women like then i dont want to hear anymore complaints when i smack them on the ass  this is worse than soft care porn  at least those people are sexy
Jul 8 2015,positive,i did not read the book i did not like the ending i cannot imagine watching this in a crowd grin but it was a cool story and an interesting look into the bdsm lifestyle
Jul 8 2015,negative,it wasnt just awful but i certainly wouldnt watch it again it definitely wasnt at all what i thought it would be jamie and dakota just didnt go together to me they didnt have real chemistry i also think it wouldve been better had jamie kept his irish accent personal opinion 
Jul 6 2015,negative,i was excited about this due to the abundance of rave reviews from the novels unfortunately this film lacked in everything an hbo series had more entertaining porn scenes then this film they made christian grey seem like a psychopath abuser
Jul 6 2015,negative,the cream the white the offwhite the bone or the 50 shades of beige a dully loyal and flaccid continuance of the books hype the woefully inflated first 50 shades franchise instalment is limp failing to stimulate    the 50 shades formula spired from water cooler lore of naïve girl meets   emotionally unavailable boy fixing his woes while embracing her own somewhat risqué sexual proclivities needs little plot description or reiterations     congratulations on a valiant effort by dakota johnson to capture the naivety one miss anastasia steele however jamie dornans incomparable mr christian grey was simply laughable lacking the strength or commanding presence the character demanded shame on you mr hunnam for pulling out    the film also does little justice for the practice of bdsm the timidly explored and misconstrued red room of pain was meekly translated     the verdict vanilla     published  canberra weekly magazine  date of publication  26022015
Jul 6 2015,positive,could have been better  i had very high hopes  anastasia was great but a different betterbetter looking actor could have been chosen for christian
Jul 5 2015,positive,3  5 starring george clooney hugh laurey         movie night with ricky not bad had higher hopes for the storyline thought there would be more action than there actually was
Jul 5 2015,negative,before anyone gets defensive because i know a lot of people have read these books let me just say for the record i dont get it when the books came out everyone was talking about them at school and work like they are salacious and as ive said i love trash so i picked up the first book and i use the term book loosely it was horribly written i think even those who like it know that i stopped early on because the book offended me and not with steamy content but with its message to young girls regardless of the fact that mostly middle aged women were the target audience the main character was sexually inexperienced yet performed like a pro on her first outing i think this fantasy is damaging in that it leaves young people with the impression that sexual prowess is something youre born with rather than something that develops over time and with experience however those facts aside i wondered if the movie would fix some of the errors i couldnt say if it did or didnt all i can say is i dont know why on earth anyone finds this story enthralling i found it dull and maybe thats because i dont find the premise of a billionaire whisking me off to meet his family while i consider a legally binding contract to be his sex slave appealing personally but there are plenty of films that do not reflect my life dream or fantasy relationship that i still nonetheless enjoy watching to those in the audience of my local theater including my friends that went with me i apologize for my snoring i know it must have been awful because i woke myself up a few times    have a different take tell me about it      
Jul 5 2015,negative,well this is one of the rare times where the movie was better than the book and it was not nearly as bad as i thought it would be but that isnt really a good thing its just kinda boring honestly dakota johnson and her wit  comedic timing is probably the best thing about it jamie dornan tries his best i guess but just comes off really bland it was just overall blah
Jul 5 2015,negative,so weak what a dud of a film
Jul 5 2015,neutral,i wasnt one of the millions of people that read the book  with that being said i didnt find the movie to be as dirty as everyone was clamoring about  i figured there would be some downplaying of scenes  it wasnt a bad movie  a bit predictable  i was really curious when they started grey out to be a stalker but then when a different direction  this really reminded me of a lifetime flick
Jul 5 2015,negative,i gave this movie half a star because it has some worth if you riff it or watch it while playing a drinking game  calling it kinky is disrespectful to the word kinky  its boring  watch it with your mom
Jul 4 2015,neutral,cheesy nonsense but still a nice bit of fun to watch
Jul 4 2015,negative,the plot refuses to make sense less than halfway through the movie the acting is mediocre at best the script is horrifying theres nothing relatable or much of anything to attach you to these characters there almost no legitimate chemistry i mean the only thing truly good about this movie is the cinematography dakota johnson offers a convincing performance  its a bad movie that got overmaketed most people watched it because they knew sex was a big part of it
Jul 4 2015,positive,very corny but with a lil wine it was captivating then left me hanging
Jul 3 2015,neutral,pretty hot way better than the book
Jul 3 2015,positive,it was was a good movie but compared to the book it was a huge dissapointnent
Jul 3 2015,negative,i cant even be bothered to put words together to describe how stupid and ridiculous this film is
Jul 3 2015,positive,anticipation sexual tension and erotic music done right  i did not think i was going to like the film  i was surprised by how much i did  the music was spot on
Jul 3 2015,negative,this was an all out waste of time with very few redeeming qualities one is the fact that the directors husband is aaron taylorjohnson who is kickass and quicksilver but honestly this was awful jamie dornan should have stayed as an underwear model seeing as he never had to convincingly deliver dialogue and as it turns out he never did honestly dakota johnson was one aspect that was alright unlike jamie i do look forward to seeing her in other roles in the future that do not involve this series given the fact that this story is very similar to twilight i imagine that it attracts the same audience i have heard many times since this released that it is nothing like twilight ignorance is bliss i guess anyway other than dakota the one other aspect of the movie that was decent is the cinematography though it is not a marvel like birdman it makes drudging through the painfully long never ending boring movie a slight bit more enjoyable for fun when i watch movies i often times like to grade them in my mind when jamie dornan belts out that one magnificently terrible line when questioned why he is the way he is i could not control my laughter and thought how does he know the title of the movie is this just a common phrase he uses if it werent already at an f it would have dropped a full grade mark in the end if youre a teenage girl who enjoyed twilight or other films of this nature youll enjoy it and its not my place to criticize you for liking what you like but if you  in my opinion enjoy quality movies skip this one
Jul 2 2015,negative,huge improvement over an unreadable  book
Jul 2 2015,positive,it will leave you   amazingly brilliantly utterly speechless
Jul 1 2015,negative,no excitement at all just seemed everything was moving at a snails pace
Jun 30 2015,negative,with 30 mins left in this movie i was still waiting on it to start great last shot in the elevator though
Jun 30 2015,negative,not only does it waste a cast and crew who are clearly trying their hardest not only is it aggressively chauvinist in just about every aspect not only is it not even remotely sexy its just a bad story with bad characters
Jun 30 2015,negative,stick with the book it was much better
Jun 29 2015,positive,fair depiction of the book honestly it was fine thats it
Jun 29 2015,negative,awful storyline and the acting is just wooden and cheesy
Jun 29 2015,positive,i found this movie to be a great love story with great cast which caused me to read all four books with even greater enjoyment cant wait for the sequel
Jun 29 2015,negative,its really terrible like watching cardboard cutouts act out what sm relationships are not terrible its as bad at being a movie as miss steele is at being a submissive its script is as tortured as mr greys cigaretteburned soul its really really terrible
Jun 28 2015,negative,review  what a load of rubbish after all the dominating talk about what hes going to do with her with his weird and wonderful toys he ends up falling in love with her and realises that he cant live without her so what is the point of this 2 hour long movie the storyline is extremely simple basically woman meets man man  woman fall for each other man has a weird sex appetite they get it on simple i thought there was going to be some major twists or some extremely explicit sex scenes but it was two hours of watching two people falling in love i can see why women might have liked the attraction to a really warped minded man and intriguing billionaire but from a mans point of view its boring and pointless the acting wasnt bad because i was intrigued about the individuals background but i cant help feeling cheated maybe its better on paper than it is on the big screen anyway it certainly took a lot of money at the box office so theres obviously an audience for this type of movie but i really didnt get why there is so much hype surrounding it terrible    roundup  for a movie that is based around two characters falling in love i really cant see were the 40million budget went jamie doman has only really starred in tv series except for his role in marie antoinette so he was a weird choice for this major blockbuster dakota johnson has starred in quite a lot of movies like 21 jump street need for speed the social network and black mass starring johnny depp and benedict cumberbatch so shes obviously got a lot of experience on the big screen personally i havent heard of her before so i thought that she was a newcomer anyway the director samantha taylorjohnson has only directed 2 other movies in her career which are districted nowhere boy maybe her lack of experience is what makes this movie so bad its been reported that she wont be returning to make fifty shades darker or fifty shades freed so theres a possibility that they might be much better than this rubbish    budget 40million  worldwide gross 570million wow    i recommend this movie to people who are into their romantic movies about a woman who falls in love with a billionaire who has a weird sexual appetite 210
Jun 28 2015,negative,dumb is the first word that comes to mind followed by punctuation if you have never lived in a city like san francisco paris los angeles new york or other places where craigslist casual encounters ads are the mainstay for actual bsdsmers this movie show ought to represent the koolaid version of that bunch the dialogue comes off like it was translated from a foreign language and written in a boys locker room by a bunch of football jocks and high school cheerleaders who just climbed out of the back of school bus and are about to go home to their dinner table with mom and dad and then sneak off to texting each other under their blankets before bedtime the actors were not really attractive once they open their mouths whatever this is it is not bdsm and not even close to being romantic stunningly dull by the end of it you will feel like you just woke up from dental work on nitrous and novocain otiose cheap zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Jun 28 2015,negative,not sure how they could classify this as a romance
Jun 27 2015,negative,couldnt rate any lower than a half star if i can i would  waste of my time
Jun 27 2015,negative, what is this movie about
Jun 27 2015,positive,so good and true to book
Jun 27 2015,negative,believe it or not the asylums answer to this piece bound i think its called is much more watchable in terms of sheer entertainment it has a plot line and everything
Jun 27 2015,negative,another two hours of my life gonesigh
Jun 27 2015,negative,id give it a minus rating if i could
Jun 26 2015,negative,not as terrible as i thought it would be but not exactly great i suspect it is better if you have read the book first perhaps it deals with the sped up character and relationship development and fills in plot holes    she is a little odd like the weird library girl with glasseschristian is seriously messed up in the headmany films have ludicrously rich guys going into secret rooms turning on the lights and they have state of the art tech for taking down bad guysbut mr greys room has floggers and butt plugs
Jun 26 2015,negative,with hopes of finding a movie so terrible that it was entertaining the internationally recognized fifty shades of grey sounded like an ideal fit for the criteria    i say that because almost everybody on the internet in the western world would know about the source novel that is fifty shades of grey and it is known for being originally a fan piece based on the ridiculouly terrible twilight series and for being one of the most commercially succesful erotic novels of all time the writing style has been often lambasted by critics as have the thin characters and so it sounds like this is one of the few times where a text would honestly work better as a film than in its original novel format this seems to be the general consensus with critics and in all honesty the film was not as bad as i was expecting nevertheless the story itself is just so poor that it drives everything down  as the fifty shades of grey novel itself is notable for a mix of poor writing and high pressure sexuality there is little to expect from its film adaptation and since the film is not a pornographic adaptation but rather an extensively promoted commercial film this severly limits the level of sexuality that can be depicted the nudity is tasteful but it hardly hits any effective level of eroticism explained in the novel i pretty much expected that but i was more frustrated by how little nudity there was in the film since fifty shades of grey has to pretend that its story matters it has to be more balanced with the sex scenes in the film being moderated but there are no genitals yeah none there is a sporadic amount of butts and boobs but nothing else i just knew that there would not be one penis on screen in the film and that was right it may have come close in one scene but for an entire film about sex there is no dongs i expected this much because of hollywoods inability to handle depiction of penises on screen but the lack of vagina is also pathetic the fact is that fifty shades of grey is extremely tame with its nudity and frankly that makes it hard to masturbate to i will admit that the sex scenes in fifty shades of grey were captured in an erotic sense with smooth moving cinematography gently timed editing and a soundtrack composed of atmospheric covers of lessthan stellar songs from recent years this illuminates that the film has a sense of style which is consistent throughout the film as the colour scheme is consistent with the narrative and the cinematography captures everything nicely which does not apply strictly to the sex scenes in the film but to the entire experience throughout however the styly cannot compensate for the story  because the sexuality in fifty shades of grey is so tame the dull nature of the narrative is made all the more clear beneath the style of the film the story itself has characters who are not interesting and a relationship which is just confusing as it goes between being about obsession sexual desires and even possession without any consistency what goes on between anastasia ana steele and christian grey is uncreative and dull writing and no amount of style or acting can save the fact that the film is about a relationship which starts nowhere and goes in circles which leaves it ending in the same position the actors may have chemistry but there is nothing to learn from the film viewers will most likely walk away from fifty shades of grey with no understanding of the relationship shared between the couple at the heart of the story e l james really is not a person who knows how to make characters and i cant imagine what it would be like to read through this dull and directionless story when watching it is boring enough i will admit that the style of the film caught be off guard occasionallyt which served as a sporadic distraction but when i actually thought about the kind of film that i was watching i realized that it was the same pathetic romantic drama made by everybody else ever only with a creepy male character and a slight sense of style the story in fifty shades of grey is not one that needs to be told and that is all there is to it  i will admit that the cast of fifty shades of grey performed better than i expected  dakota johnson delivers a fine leading performance as anastasia ana steele in fifty shades of grey ive never read the source novel before but i am aware that the character has often being criticised for being ridiculously idiotic and saying oh my more than george takei dakota johnson approaches the role well enough so that it is not idiotic but in such a way that the character is somewhat naive albeit passionate she takes the material very seriously and manages to play the character with strong sex appeal and a powerful grip over the drama in the more hard hitting scenes of the film dakota johnsons leading performance transcends the incompetent writing in fifty shades of grey and paves the way for a potentially strong career  jamie dornan is also effective as christian grey also stuck in the part of a onedimensional character jamie dornan captures a mysterious edge for the character christian grey and puts on a hardedged facade to bury things inside but there is a genuine sense that he is hiding something and not only playing the role as a shallow character particularly in the way that he interacts with dakoata johnson the relationship they share is poorly depicted but jamie dornans ability to capture both a sense of passion for her and for the idea of possessing her is intense jamie dornan makes a good effort in fifty shades of grey by capturing a darkly sense of charm and sophistication with a touch of madness which becomes more apparent as the film progresses    so fifty shades of grey benefits from the performances of dakota johnson and jamie dornan as well as sam taylorjohnsons ability to capture a sense of style but with the narrative being so incoherent stupid and repetitive it drags everything else down in this overlong and tame excuse for a film
Jun 26 2015,positive,not sure why so many people rated robinsons or didnt like the movie im thinking they didnt read the book or had no idea what the story is about  the fifty shades series was excellent to read and this movie is a pretty great adaptation of the first novel the actors portray the subjects of the novel very well regarding their personalities and interactions  once youve read the book you catch more of what is happening in the movie which makes it more enjoyable  id say the actors who portray anastasia steele and christian grey got it spot on
Jun 26 2015,positive,when i got home i received a devilish look from my gf as she picked up a belt send help
Jun 26 2015,positive,i would really love to see this movie
Jun 26 2015,negative,3rd worst movie ive ever seen i was waiting for the fbi to consult with dr lector to help bring this guy down alcohol couldnt help it either
Jun 26 2015,neutral,the steamy scenes are intense but its a weak plot and the acting is blahish
Jun 25 2015,negative,awkward pretentious not enough dick she gets her tits out he needs to reciprocate no fun
Jun 24 2015,negative,so far i think this is the worst movie of the year for me  i just had to see what all the hype was about  for starters it was not the raunchy sexy movie it claims to be  secondly it is evidend that it was written on a blackberry which a twilight fan sat in the movies watching twilight films like she admitted  thirdly there is nothe kinky in this film without indending to boast ive done stuff in the bedroom far more extreme than anything in this movie  the writer is clearly a lonely lady who is inexperienced sexually and romantically  its ending makes you feel like you wasted your time it constantly wreaks of effort and leaves me wondering if these are the things women truly fantasize about  the characters are so unbelievable that they are almost parodys of themselves  this movie is a steaming pile of cow dung that could not arouse a 13 year old boy in the girls locker room  fail
Jun 24 2015,positive,i heard so many bad things about it i was expecting it to be so bad that it was easy for it to actually be enjoyable p im glad i watched it perfect cast
Jun 24 2015,negative,as a satire of modern fleshy relationships in the corporate world of lustful desire and an overall comedy it may have worked out pretty well for what its trying to be however    
Jun 24 2015,positive,was expecting more but was a good movie would love to see the next one
Jun 24 2015,positive,excellent movie not as graphic as the books which was a good thing good cast would recommend watching this if your a fan of the books
Jun 24 2015,negative,if i could give it less than half a star i would  el james really needs to go back to researching what it truly means to be a part of the sm culture  the character christian grey is an abusive egotistical sociopath and borders on psychotic  poor acting not sexy not convincing and not worth watching the sequels
Jun 24 2015,positive,my wife loved it and was left wanting more
Jun 23 2015,neutral,surprisingly i liked this even though its more aimed at females the acting and story was successful enough to keep me hooked
Jun 23 2015,negative,fifty shades of grey is truly porn for women for some women this is there version of porn male domination women submission and the game of it thats cool by me the problem here is that its a movie and its written like bad porn
Jun 22 2015,positive,loved it wished it followed the book more but cant wait to see the next one in 2017
Jun 22 2015,positive,i actually really enjoyed this initially i wasnt happy with the actors chosen but they did the roles justice
Jun 22 2015,positive,its actually a very good movie people rating are close minded its the modern day pretty woman welcome to 2015 everyone wake up
Jun 22 2015,negative,garbage i dont know what was all the fuzz about
Jun 22 2015,negative,fifty shades of horrible
Jun 22 2015,positive,the none theater version ending is soo oooooo frustrating
Jun 22 2015,positive,i dont understand why everyone hated this movie so muchâ they cant show porn in movie theaters the female actresses supposed to be plain innocent looking
Jun 21 2015,negative,i watched the movie because a friend brought to my home it was a creepy movie i am giving 12 star for the cinematography this book was written by someone who probably inspired on venus in fur and copied the idea to trash it the film is not about sensuality it is about a psychopath taking advantage of a naïve woman i cant believe people bought the book and watched it this is pure crap
Jun 21 2015,positive,i actually liked the movie despite the mixed reviews looking forward to the other two
Jun 21 2015,negative,horrible lousy and boring
Jun 21 2015,negative,even the sex scenes were dreadful
Jun 20 2015,positive,im so upset to say it but i thoroughly enjoyed this movies acting wasnt great but honestly i felt like there actually was romance and omg the soundtrack was so good
Jun 20 2015,negative,wow who in their right mind would watch this heaping pile of garbage the plot has nothing to it the actors are horrible and dull the movie itself cant even be pornography because its rated r rated r movies are not meant to be pornos thats what porn is for if they make a sequel to this movie im ignoring it and using all the books as toilet paper
Jun 20 2015,negative,maybe anastasia should have read a little less jane austen and should have consulted the internet about bdsm a little more before falling in love with a millionaire dom called christian so she could have found out by herself that she is not a sub that would have saved us 50 shades of movie by the way really are six blows with a belt on her evil bum the worst he could do in the last ten minutes of the movie where did the good old hot candle wax dripping on the skin go
Jun 20 2015,negative,this movie is just as bad as the book when did we as movie goers accept trashy movies adapted from poorly written trashy novels everything from anastasia chewing on a grey company pen to the biting of her lip leaves nothing to the imagination dakota johnson looks like a prepubescent boy while jamie dornan is much hotter with his irish accent yes there is a butt here and a boob there but this is absolutely no sexual chemistry between these two actors in my opinion stick with movies like basic instinct and wild things to get no only great sex but a real story to go along with it
Jun 20 2015,negative,well at least its better than twilight
Jun 19 2015,positive,well made and well acted film with a great use of music which surprises me as the plot and story is weak
Jun 19 2015,positive,i liked this movie but the book was way better
Jun 19 2015,negative,the book was tedious so the movie just followed suit
Jun 19 2015,negative,trashy and exploitative fifty shades of grey is a provocative piece of escapist fantasy  in this dark and sadistic tale a young woman named anastasia steele is drawn into a controlling and abusive relationship thats cloaked in eroticism  both the story and the characters are poorly written and the performances by dakota johnson and jamie dornan arent very good  also the sex scenes dont feel congruent with the tone of the rest of the film which undermines the development of the characters and their relationship  and while theres an attempt to make anastasia empowered shes really isnt and is emotionally and physically abused to break her of her puritanical views of sex and romance  fifty shades of grey is a vapid and pointless film that tries to get by on shock value
Jun 18 2015,negative,its horrible very horrible
Jun 18 2015,negative,i fell asleep during this movie  i havent done that since twilight new moonand that was in the theater  while i will say dakota johnsons acting did get a tad better towards the end of the film this thing is just awful to watch  yea its got sex and nudity but johnson is so skinny you see her ribs whenever she is naked thats just gross  i heard this is based on someones twilight fan fiction  so if you make a story based off a crappy storymovie youre going to get an even crappier storymovie hello  if you like this movie just unfriend me  no hard feeling but i cant associate with someone who likes this movie
Jun 17 2015,negative,i actually fell asleep at one point the first 5 minutes i felt the story and screenplay had potentialthen the 6th minute past   at times the acting felt like i was watching a high school play  but of smut
Jun 17 2015,negative,maybe the worst thing i have ever seen
Jun 17 2015,negative,boring snoozefest for me
Jun 17 2015,neutral,wrong choice of actorsbook was better
Jun 16 2015,negative,this is one of the worst movies ive ever seen it does not have a good story line acting is terrible and very unrealistic the only people who will like this are women who are lonely and hard up
Jun 16 2015,positive,interesting look into a world that i am unfamiliar left me wanting more to the story and more to the relationship
Jun 16 2015,positive,interesting story with lots of tension and insight but too commercialized and made out to be something completely different than it actually was i feel like the only reason this was a huge blockbuster was the spectacle of seeing near pornographic images in entertainment and shock value and few except for me and others who dont really care about nudity try to see anything beyond that though there still isnt much to ponder over anastasia reminds me way to much of kristen stewarts bella and i just kept on making parallels between the two films the only thing that saved the sloppy script were the two leads but as ive already said weve seen this before and though i liked the tone pace and some of the vulnerability it showed 50 shades of grey did not explore a lot of territory that we havent already seen before and the ending leaves you empty and wanting more but what i can say is i was mostly entertained till the end
Jun 16 2015,negative,film review fifty shades of grey or gidget gets a whipping  
Jun 16 2015,negative,thank god this was so terrible so i dont have to be made watch the other ones
Jun 15 2015,negative,quite possibly the worst movie ever made i actually couldnt even finish it zero chemistry among the actors the scriptwowlike a teenage girl in remedial literature class showing off their diary sickening
Jun 15 2015,positive,a billionaire with an exclusive penthouse condo private helicopter private jet over a half dozen expensive luxury cars ceo of his own company  very plausible  a 27 yearold billionaire with all of this already in place even though he was adopted at age four by a wealthy family not so plausible   compare  in 1987 gates was listed as a billionaire in forbes magazines 400 richest people in america issue just days before his 32nd birthday  between the ages 15 through 21 christopher grey spent six years as a submissive to a married woman who was his dominant  then consider that he had 15 submissives in the one particular play room we see in the movie  the book says that the standard submissivedominant contrasts were for three months and that he had four long term relationships in his life  if you do the math fifteen submissives each lasting three months is 375 years 45 months  some of the submissives lasted more than three months  we arent told when he started his company or when his net worth hit one billion but this information suggests that he had roughly six years give or take to accomplish this level of wealth  im assuming that perhaps he went to college and either dropped out like bill gates did or he graduated at age 21  how many bill gates are there in the united states  even if he did not attend college its not too plausible that grey could be a billionaire  maybe the point was to make him unquestionably powerful influential extraordinary and sexy to anna    annas character is more conceivable   she was a virgin at age 21 or 22 no prior boyfriends graduating with honors thesis notes in english literature with no definite plans upon graduation except for moving to seattle with her friend and roommate   just so happens that mr grey resides in seattle  she fell hard for grey due to her vulnerability and because she was not attracted to any of her peers  enter the knight in shining armor and she cannot resist him no matter what     there were so many telltale signs that she shouldnt get involved with a man who tells her point blank that he does not do romance he only fuckshard  he warned her three times  she is lucky that grey did not destroy her when he reconciled the condition of her virginity  in this respect grey is confusing as to what he is being that he could make love on this one occasion  it could be that he decided that a woman with zero experience was an opportunity he shouldnt pass up         aside from the fairytale of a 27 yearold billionaire the problem with the movie is that it confuses the issue as to what christian grey really is  if the information provided by wikipedia is accurate he seems to fall under one of the four classes of sexual masochists rather than one of the four classes of sexual sadists  yet anna says to him youre a sadist and he does not really respond or deny her labeling  is he in fact a sadist because of the type of punishment he administers such as whipping women with a belt and having them count each time they are struck  not until i saw that only people who must engage nonconsensually could be a killer rapist or a dominant that inflicts serious injury was i convinced that grey was not one of these people   and there is doubt that only is accurate  i would have preferred that annas research on bdsm covered this ground because the movie producers and directors have a responsibility when dealing with sensitive topics with main stream audiences   secondly wouldnt annas character who leads a very constrained life have this very concern that her life might be in actual danger      when grey and anna had a business meeting in a conference room at his office to negotiate the terms of the sd contract it seemed that some viewers could easily confuse some of the practices that can be deemed nonbdsm with bdsm only behavior     how was grey able to control his actions and how was he able to respect the limits set by his submissives  he was sexually abused at age 15 having been seduced by an older woman to become her submissive after all  isnt that statutory rape  and this is on top of abuse in the first four years of his life by his biological mother a drug addict and prostitute  remember he tells anna that if he told her why he must punish women so severely she would not have anything to do with him  part of the reason he had some selfcontrol might be because he needed to win the trust of his female submissives which he needed in order to maintain the consensual relationships  the answer might also have to do with the doctor probably a psychologist that he confided in and the paid sex he utilized in his training to become a dominant according to the book   the movie should have touched on these aspects of mr greys behavior as the issue was left wide open  having formal written contracts does not imply an ability to have selfcontrol and the capacity to respect for anothers limits or preferences  without selfcontrol the contract terms can be easily breached        the good thing about the movie was that the sex scenes although ive read that they are covered in 20 minutes roughly 18 of the movie were kept minimal in number and filmed or edited to give the audience a brief view of the actual sexual activity so that our minds can fill in the rest   the romance story was the emphasis rather than a full exhibition of soft porn     im not sure what the movie intended to say about bdsm  even if there was no intentional message it does send out some harmful or distorted messages
Jun 15 2015,negative,dont waste your time watching
Jun 15 2015,positive,my favorite part was when he banged her right in the butthole
Jun 15 2015,negative,a coming of age tale where two star crossed lovers meet over a unrealistically hotinnocentshy print media journalists interview as the journalist asks the first 27 year billionaire that isnt mark zuckerberg questions he stares at her in a pedophile manner that doesnt make her uncomfortable when the billionaire shows up at the journalists second job at the hardware store and stares at her again in a creepy manner she is yet again not phased that he has most likely beheaded someone but has gotten away with it so what does she do the only thing she knows how to doset up a photo shoot where he stares at her in such a way that hes imagining what her skin would look like as his new coat next she agrees to a coffee date this aint your lets talk about our lord and savior jesus christ standard coffee date  he leaves awkward after staring at her again probably to go eat human flesh to satisfy his desires a sexual relationship starts there are a few misunderstandings that could be settled quickly by calling the authorities but im doing giving away spoilers for those who hate spoilers i love plane rides and cities with a general population of over 100000 people so i have to give an extra star for that footage
Jun 14 2015,positive,when i finally got past the random stuff christian would say out of no where and really got into the movie it went off  i will watch the next one but i dont have high hopes for it
Jun 14 2015,negative,50 shades of grey is one of the worst pieces of trash i have seen the direction shows promise but the script acting and characters show nothing the whole movie anastasia steele is talking to a wall jamie dornans performance is that of a piece of shit that gets put into your freezer and you are now stuck with it      510
Jun 14 2015,positive,i found this film adapted from the book of the same name to be surprisingly entertaining high movie production values and an excellent director were evident in this racy but classy drama i myself have not read the book adults only  810 rev 209
Jun 14 2015,negative,anastasia steele fills in for her sick friend interviewing the billionaire christian grey for their student newsletter after the initial meeting and other brief encounters christian finds her drunk and takes her home to take care of her while unwell which is the beginning of their relationship     based on the erotic fanfiction for twilight it is no surprise that the terrible story it was based on translates to an even worse story for this film comparable events that were stupid in twilight become even more idiotic once the supernatural element is taken away most of the plot revolves around the signing of a contract for their sexual adventures to go forth but then it is later disregarded having no meaning one of the main plot points has zero meaning story is only one of the many problems this movie has with the prime thing being the script if you are alive then you would gag at how terrible everything anyone says is just utter drivel actually to be fair it could have been spun as a comedy and then the script would be spot on onto the acting which was not just bad  it was awful jamie dornan could be a nice guy in real life but as an actor in this film he was the worst just the delivery of every line is unbelievable and as bland as sugarfree cheesecake the constant lip biting which was focused on made it not sexy at all also a little thing but why does she have a flip phone just why    moving on to what you really want to hear about how well does the film portray the erotic moments of the book as you may be aware the infamous tampon scene was cut what was left in was a few sex scenes similar to any other movie and then after 90 minutes of a 2 hour film they enter the playroom once inside not much of what is shown would be even slightly steamy not helping the fact is the utter lack of chemistry between the two leads     not only does fifty shades of grey lack any deep exploration into the discovery of bdsm and its psychology it fails as a simple movie that has a couple falling in love and having sex the music adds more emotion then any character or plot point in the film it fails as everything but perhaps a comedy half a point because it made me laugh
Jun 14 2015,neutral,this one was a bit different for me its going to definitely be a bit stranger to people that are locked up in their rooms or have been hiding under a rock but fifty shades of grey wasnt as shocking as i thought it would anastasia steele dakota johnson is a college student that is filling in for a friend to interview businessman christian grey jamie dornan they meet and immediately christian is drawn to anastasia soon enough he starts popping up at anastasias work grabs coffee and they both have a pretty sure thing attraction to each other theres more to it though with christian eventually revealing to anastasia that hes into sm he wants anastasia to sign a contract agreeing to all these things between them which he can and cant do anastasia seems to want it at first but is really looking for more of a romantic relationship something that christian has told her he doesnt do the film continues on exploring their relationship and how controlling christian ultimately becomes i will say right off the bat johnson and dornan have a great on screen chemistry they work off each other well especially during the more intimate scenes and they seem believable unfortunately the films writing is atrocious dialogue seems off and wooden at times and unbelievable the films pacing is also really bad its only a 2 hour film but it almost feels like three theres a lot of the movie that could have been cut down and edited for pacing purposes especially the last half where i felt scenes were just repeats of what had happened already overall a different kind of film that women will more than likely enjoy more than men its a rent regardless to see if it sparks any kind of interest
Jun 13 2015,negative,equivalent to an episode of red shoe diaries
Jun 13 2015,negative,there wasnt a minus 5star rating probably the most expensive soft porn movie ever made i watched it out of curiosity and because i like jamie dornan who was sadly below the pathetic line in this film i am sure all fans of the film will cry out that the book is so much better  but i wasnt compelled to read the book the fact that it gained such a following can only mean the sad state of affairs in the female psyche evidently the world has forgotten about 9 12 weeks years ago  again about a welloff suave and good looking man and the some what screwed up relationship he has with a hapless female the dominant and submissive themes in that relationship was portrayed as well except  the sexual tension in that film was 10 times more intense than this sorry excuse for erotic literature turned into a film     it is sad that many years on women have seemingly not advanced why did she have to be a history graduate and not engineering or quantum physics so she gave her virginity to a screwed up multimillionaire  but no surprises either given the fact that her role model ie her mother spent so much time in and out of relationships     i am saddened that so many women bought into the trilogy  enough that some studio thought it would be a good idea to make movies out of them     just terrible the worst movie ive seen in a long long time
Jun 12 2015,negative,112 of these stars are awarded for the smidgen of jamie dornans peen i saw  otherwise it was just as terrible as you expect
Jun 12 2015,negative,it follows the book  but felt like a teenager directed and casted
Jun 12 2015,negative,this movie has rotten banality right from the start film makers try hard to force feed grownups a cliched and lousy romanticism there is no substance just snobbish high end italian made pianos so much money so little workand all other shit that is needed for a modern day grown up cinderellas dreams strongly recommended avoid it is such a waste of 2 hrous
Jun 12 2015,negative,oh jeez you knew it was going to bad right the good news is it could have been worse but ultimately fifty shades fails because the effort is tepid and unwilling to fully embrace its trashy origins     fifty shades of gray and its sequels are megaselling novels with worldwide success written by 50ish brit el james  the author made up this pseudonym to avoid judgment from her friends a wise choice  fifty shades was conceived after she fell in love with the twilight novels james even desired to have robert pattinson play the role of christian gray wtf     most readers with discerning taste will tell you that those fifty shades books make the twilight series read like shakespeare that is not a ringing endorsement of the material so is the movie better certainly but it still doesnt rise to the titillating levels of classic trash like wild things 9  12 weeks and showgirls its a little too selfconscious probably because a soft rrating had to be required by any studio seeing dollar signs i still expected more from a female director especially one who in her 40s bedded hot actor aaron taylor kickass avengers 2 and had two kids with her boytoy so jamie dornan the enigmatic serial killer on netflixs the fall  everyone should be watching this is a cool emotionally vacuous christian with just a hint of danger when he should exude a lot and dakota johnson daughter of hollywood royalty melanie griffith and don johnson is adequate as anastasia steele but shes so whiny he states clearly want he wants even writes it in a contract and she still bitches it makes their torrid bedroom play  including flogging bondage and guilt  seem like a typical contentious relationship he wants it his way and pays for it but she still wants more the things money cant buy  like love respect humanity     two more of these are coming to theaters in the near future my suggestion recast anastasia with someone more game than the amateurish johnson and double down on the sex it sells
Jun 12 2015,negative,there are some good parts to the movie but the overall story is terrible
Jun 11 2015,negative,disgusting piece of shit
Jun 11 2015,positive,i def didnt hate it i mean it extra stupid but having said that i loved dakota johnson she sells the shit out of her lame dialogue and shes very charismatic i kinda just wished she was on screen the whole time he however was extra stiff and i didnt buy him ever as this dominant he just scowls at her the whole time i think it helps that a woman wrote and directed it the sex never seems degrading and sleazy the film is well directed and shot beautifully its just so  silly most of the time however i was never bored and i liked watching it and i loved johnson so ill stick around for the sequel to these ridiculous stories
Jun 11 2015,negative,pretty dull considering the subject matter  so this is about english major anastasia steele dakota johnson  she fills in for her friend to interview the mysterious billionaire christian grey jamie dornan  her life is about to be turned upside down when he asks her out on a date and she soon learns about his sordid bedroom activities  it has been confirmed this was originally conceived as twilight fanfiction  talk about setting your sights low speaking as somebody who has seen all five twilight movies i can rightfully say those are stories that dont need additional exploration  its a series that is already stretched as is who needs to see the further adventures  these are different characters sure but you wouldnt be able to tell from the female protagonists both bella swan and anastasia steele are equals as far as being complete blank slates  theyre both not terrible looking but they are not dropdead gorgeous to the point that guys should be fighting for them if either one of them were playing hardtoget i promise you any guy would just move on  this series is wildly popular and i really havent been able to determine why  i have not read the books but my wife confirmed that they are amateurishly written overusing the word clamor more times than she could count  whats frustrating about this material has very little to do with the depravity of it all it is grating because the characters are so inconsistent  as smart as anastasia is supposed to be she freaks out when christian does his usual activities  that is literally what she signed up for and i do mean that a contract is drafted  at the same time christian repeatedly says i dont do romance and then proceeds to take anastasia on helicopter rides plane rides and out for family dinners  apart from having a dark streak in the bedroom the guy does nothing but romance  both of them do nothing but send mixed signals which would be frustrating in any relationship never mind in a movie  this is also really creepy and again it has very little to do with the kinky flair this story has to it  christian is essentially a sexually scarred bruce wayne throughout this and he appears out of nowhere at anastasias place of work to surprise her with a date  he also apparently has tracking hooked up to her bal because the moment anastasia has one drink too many he again appears out of nowhere  he has so many sociopathic tendencies that it would cause red flags to go up for anybody but anastasia remains oblivious throughout  you can watch this as an unintentional comedy and have a movie to laugh at and make fun of all of the melodrama much like the boy next door but thats really the best i can say about it  this story will lead women to believe that you can change your man to be the guy of your dreams which is not a message females today really need to be hearing  bottom line both of these characters need to get over themselves and i promise you will feel the same way if you choose to watch this
Jun 11 2015,negative,pathetic movie rarely any implementation of the book after the beginning straight creepy porno shot by a very good production company trash movie doesnt give any interest to watch the second part that will come out
Jun 11 2015,neutral,theres an actual interesting story here but jamie dornan lacks the abilities to make grey a believable character
Jun 11 2015,negative,throw it out becuase it stinks
Jun 10 2015,positive,it was not what was expected i was happy that the critics were wrong
Jun 10 2015,positive,lots of nippies  liked this more than i should have  the ending sucked
Jun 10 2015,negative,didnt really care much about this movie
Jun 10 2015,negative,terrible actingno chemistry and really boringthat about sums up the entire movie
Jun 10 2015,negative,50 shades of lame ive seen more interesting stories and soft porn sex scenes on skinemax this movie was based on sex and it couldnt keep my interest in the least its a mix of contracts begging boring sex scenes over the top panting and moaning fairy tale dates and boring story in the middle the end wasnt satisfying and left re opening for the sequel which im dreading already
Jun 9 2015,positive,im totally obsessed with this movie
Jun 9 2015,negative,this film lacks of sexuality the characters do not transmit any sexual code and they look like actors posing for a fragrance ad rather than an erotic movie
Jun 9 2015,negative,bad chemistry between actors comes through on the screen big time
Jun 9 2015,neutral,much better then i remember the book being
Jun 8 2015,negative,not nearly as erotic as you would expect based on the reaction to the book version while the characters are somewhat interesting its not enough to really suck you in by the end of the film i didnt care if they got together or not and it didnt really garner much interest in seeing any sequels which you know are coming regardless of how the first film is received
Jun 8 2015,positive,missed some key information from the book but was overall satisfying
Jun 8 2015,negative,ummm speechless movie
Jun 7 2015,positive,the book is better but the movie is not bad if u see it first
Jun 7 2015,negative,this was horrid  sad and pathetic the actors were subpar the main characters were unimpressive the was the biggest snooze lamefest of all time i didnt read the book and sad as hell i wasted over an hour on this ridiculous movie this was not convincing not at all
Jun 7 2015,positive,weird and vulgar but exactly like the book
Jun 7 2015,negative,terrible its not erotic provocative original or interesting its like watching opposite day the movie some of the worst writing ive ever sat through
Jun 7 2015,negative,such a basic ass storyline not impressed at all but then again i wasnt expecting much
Jun 7 2015,positive,i loved the books so i loved the movie but im rating this as if i never read the books just based on movie acting etc i think many things were left out that readers of frog would know already but without the advantage of reading the books christan may seem very stiff or seem like an ass also the way they left the end way confusing for many
Jun 7 2015,negative,bout as good as the booksslightly better
Jun 6 2015,negative,i couldnt even finish the book
Jun 6 2015,negative,fifty shades of total fucking shit
Jun 6 2015,positive,i know people fussed about it sort of slow moving not too graphicor pornographic ill watch the second one
Jun 6 2015,neutral,i found fifty shades of grey only strung on bdsm and a clearly plain moral but the strange and artistic way it takes the story surprised me it only gets 2 12 stars from me because of the clearly playboyisticks of christian and the unintrested reactions from anistasia this movie was boring to the core but not unforgettable it was bad but not terrible final verdict 2 12 stars and a 3 out of 10
Jun 6 2015,negative,as someone who has not read the books and does not intend to i wasnt sure exactly what to expect while watching the movie the characters are pretty shallow and slightly unbelievable in a realworld sense and the motivations seem very contrived this movie was just barely entertaining and it seems difficult to comprehend how this can develop in to future sequels i guess ill just have to wait and see
Jun 6 2015,positive,the book is wonderful im just wondering if the movie is going to be the same way
Jun 6 2015,positive,fifty shades of fuckedup
Jun 6 2015,negative,this is pretty much like a soft porn movie you would find on either skinemax or playboy tv late at night only with a bigger budget it comes complete with atrocious cringe worthy dialogue never read the book and i dont intend to in order to determine which is better dakota johnson wasnt too bad to look at though
Jun 6 2015,negative,me no of this is very believable  wife like the walking dead is  me boobsin my head  movie ends  me thats it  wife i think they were more focused on the soundtrack than the story
Jun 6 2015,negative,bad movie bad actingnot more to say about it
Jun 6 2015,positive,dont really get the movie  but it sure knows how to catch audiences
Jun 6 2015,negative,save your time rent a real xxx movie  any xxx plot makes more sense
Jun 5 2015,neutral,ok been there  saw that  got the t shirt
Jun 5 2015,negative,the good parts was shit and the bad parts was worse it was mediore at everything it tried to accomplish  bad chemistry between dakota and whats his face
Jun 5 2015,positive,ok ok soooooo just watched this and i have to say we all could use a little christian grey in our lives lol this movie was very sexy that all i did was smile the whole time hahahaha  i guess i like bdsm
Jun 4 2015,negative,this movie is for people who have not a clueabout what to do in the bedroom  if you think this is thrilling then you have a problem lame
Jun 3 2015,negative,so awful worse then the book if thats possible
Jun 3 2015,negative,boring annoying and so bad
Jun 3 2015,negative,i cant believe all that hype this movie has received great pr stunt about nothing  about as much plot as a porno but without the sex scenes to make it worth your time these characters are basically stick figures  one dimensional the protagonist is a nothing little girl nothing to say nothing to do with scene after scene after scene of her trembling and trying to decide whether or not to have sex with a billionaire if you like idiotic conversations absurd stereotypes and very humdrum porn this is the movie for you if you look for some story or semblance of genuine emotions stay away  for the most shallow audience members  the sheltered cul de sac types  this will be one of their favorite films after all every chick flick sizes up a man by what he owns and his social status this movie delivers on that mr perfect who gives extravagant gifts drives fast cars has a penthouse can fly his own helicopter but doesnt know how to love only how to tie girls up and spank them this is no 9 12 weeks i never felt any  chemistry between the characters nothing was believable the movie just plotted along once it finally got momentum it was over awkward ending this is a movie without a purpose    rentstreambuy etc something else
Jun 3 2015,positive,lets get something out of the way there is a movie like this that comes out about every decade fatal attraction basic instinct jade these films brought racy stuff back then and this film brings exactly that only this time it has three parts for intro its not bad jamie dornan does look like a serial killer but i am told hes like that in the book till part 2 will see then
Jun 2 2015,negative,worse than twilight  its just wtf
Jun 2 2015,positive,apparently its attractive to be a stalker and a sadist as long as you are good looking and rich
Jun 1 2015,negative,theyre not too many movies that scar me for life this one however was an exemption i dont know what was worse the movie or the acting el james you murdered the art of cinema and not in a good way either
Jun 1 2015,negative,absolutely terrible i was looking forward to some intense sex scenes but any physical contact was justboring the acting is horrible as well save your time and watch anything else instead i get more excited watching judge judy
May 31 2015,positive,the greatest obstacle here is that people expect a monumental cinematic love story to be constructed from the pages of a dirty novel  considering the nature of the source material sam taylorjohnsons fifty shades of grey is about as good of an adaptation as any director could produce
May 31 2015,negative,worse than the twilight movies combined
May 31 2015,negative,a cliche parade with a very softcore approach to bdsm the only redeeming quality of this movie is dakota johnson
May 31 2015,negative,the book isnt better than the movie and the film isnt better than the book their both the same in terms of awfulness
May 31 2015,negative,this movie was awful i didnt even bother to finish it slow and boring then just an awful to portray women
May 31 2015,positive,it didnt follow the book as much as i wanted it to it was very romantic though and i dont think people should judge its just a movie not as much real life as what people think
May 30 2015,positive,was surprisingly good if you like romances i read the book and didnt finish it because it was just about the sex i thought the movie would be the same but i think condensing the plot points made it much more engaging and the actors had mesmerizing chemistry
May 30 2015,negative,saved by the soundtrack
May 30 2015,positive,i had very low expectations however it had much more plot than i expected
May 30 2015,positive,it didnt follow the book but it still kept my attention i would like to see the trilogy on screen
May 30 2015,negative,after so much hype about the books which i didnt read  i was very disappointed with the movie
May 30 2015,negative,poor acting poor script and the sex was unreasonably boring
May 30 2015,positive,loved the movie the ending didnt leave me wanting more
May 30 2015,negative,i loved the book but this movie sucked  the things that killed it bad acting wrong choice actors for characters not enough content
May 29 2015,negative,its not even sobaditsgood at least the cinematography is nice
May 29 2015,positive,bad but in that good way fifty shades grey didnt turn out to be the worst film ever based on the worst book ever in fact it turned out to be the almost opposite its bad but in that so good its bad way the dialogue is hilarious the sex scenes are softcore at best and yet i enjoyed it one of those dont always believe what you hear movies
May 29 2015,negative,possibly good by soft porn standards but seriously lacking if you were looking to watch an actually movie like the secretary  dont watch for the ending it is far worse that the rest of the movie
May 29 2015,negative,although not as bad as the book the film was overhyped and the plot was thin and had no substance the actors did their best but even that couldnt save the film on top of all this the abrupt ending did nothing to anticipate the sequel
May 28 2015,negative,like watching a clown drink himself to death
May 28 2015,neutral,only felt like only 2 acts of a three act movie
May 28 2015,positive,not a movie i thought id like but i loved it and cant wait for the next one
May 28 2015,positive,this is one movie that if you read the book you would was probably satisfied with the movie stayed with the story it was no extras and veered to away from the story it was a pretty good movie i liked it
May 28 2015,positive,love love love this movie
May 27 2015,positive,great movie it was really cool to see everything i had visioned reading the book cant wait for the sequel
May 27 2015,positive,this film can only function as a date movie thats all looking at it from any other perspective is a waste of time and energy with this being said enjoy the great soft core pornography
May 27 2015,negative,flat w no directionzzzzzzz i hope the book offered more excellent bestscore by dannyelfman hes still the best 50shadesofgrey 410
May 27 2015,negative,total waste of time nothing sensational about it
May 27 2015,negative,what a stinker i leaned over while my wife was on board the book obsession to try to understand the phenomenon i get it its erotica for people who arent supposed to be into erotica this movie failed to captivate the book reader and non book reader and we both left the theater saying there was nothing hot about that movie and it wasnt even watchable  the performances were laughable and the writing worse im saddened that theyre going to make more of these thankfully we will not be seeing them
May 26 2015,negative,if this does it for you ladies more power to you or not as the case may be  seemed pretty flimsy to me
May 26 2015,neutral,not entirely bad it wasnt sexy you watch it and think there is sex on the screen and that is about it also it was cheesy so cheesy that i am constipated from watching the moviein summary it was entertaining in the same way that cheesy soft core late night cinema pen is entertaining
May 26 2015,positive,fantastic bring on the 2nd movie please
May 26 2015,positive,fantastic movie cant wait to see fifty shades darker
May 26 2015,negative,utterly dumb and horrible movie the book itself is like someone wrote together all the bdsm porn they watched the book is stupid but to make a movie out of it is just dumb
May 26 2015,positive,its a very steamy weird romance if youve read the books you will be extremely disappointed as you will  expect more from the movie only to be let down
May 26 2015,negative,not bad or unintentional hilarious enough to be guilty pleasure nor is it good enough to be a decent movie fifty shades of grey wastes it slick direction breakout role by dakota johnson and a fantastic soundtrack and instead is rather tame dull and meandering turning a great opportunity into what will soon be known as the saw franchise for valentines day
May 26 2015,positive,i havent read the book because its not my genre of interest i thought a 2 hour film would be more bearable but it failed to impress me or excite any enthusiasm to read the book perhaps the book is better but i cant imagine the storyline differing greatly the film started off promising but then it started to repeat and drag on with little substance along the way would delve further but then i would give it all away managed to get through the 2 hours but wouldnt do it again
May 25 2015,negative,bad acting even worse story telling
May 25 2015,positive,not the sexfilled porno everyone wanted but a decent story and good acting gets this some stars however not enough was revealed i personally think but only just not enough
May 25 2015,positive,watched this with my missues and shes read all the books and believes this dosnt even touch at how good the books are from a movie point of view on someone who hasnt read the books this wasnt a bad film just unsure if they could make two more films but twilight managed it
May 25 2015,negative,its actually a better film then id thought it would be as the cast is actually pretty good the problem comes in the form of poor direction and a poor script when you film sells itself of being sexy and risque dont fill most of  it with talk via contract negations and weird monologues movies like basic instinct ad 9 12 weeks had the same sexual content and managed to create far better overall films
May 25 2015,positive,something different wasnt that bad
May 24 2015,negative,its hard to believe this was ever conceived not to mention how disappointing it is to see the waste of resources that took to produce this steaming pile of horse shit
May 24 2015,negative,excellent sleep aid   all hype no substance  awful movie  dont believe the hype  if you have seen the trailers you have seen the best parts the book wasnt a great novel just most peoples quilty pleasuremyself included but the film didnt even do justice to the story words words words all talk hardly anything exciting  the two main characters had the sexual chemistry of a brother and sisterwhich equals to zero and they seemed as reluctant to be acting in this film as i was watching it   how can anyone make a sex movie boringwell they managed with 50 shades of snore and more snoreit took 2 hours to say nothing  robotic bad acting weird camera angles robotic bad acting ohh did i forget robotic bad acting  i couldnt even sit through the first 30 minutes without the urge to hit fast forward i know that i am not the intended target audience since i turned 18 just four days ago but this film sucks arse the guy they cast as christian was a zombie with the acting skills of a fence post   i have read some of the 5 star reviews and all i could think of is it might be high school kids who thought this was such an amazing movie right up there with twilight lol   if any anyone is saying this movie is higher than 2 starstheyre lying to you
May 24 2015,negative,the best thing about this film is that its quite clear director sam taylorjohnson has talent its clear she knows what shes doing implores excellent cinematography and the music by danny elfman is riveting as always whats sad therefore is how depressingly dull and bland this film feels the reason why this may be is that the director had the mammoth task of adapting the utterly diabolical novel into a feature film which wasnt helped by the authors constant need to intervene whats worse the director will not be continuing to the films sequel rather the author will become more involved as a screenwriter     the problem here is that the authors words are as eloquent and sophisticated as a childs dribble something that doesnt transition well on screen from the beginning its clear taylorjohnson tries to fight this apparently cutting much of the authors ridiculous dialogue and numbingly repulsive torture sex and attempting to focus more on character development whilst i applaud this truly there are a couple of problems that arise as a result the first is that the film becomes exceedingly dull given 80 of the authors book is just well porn and with her limiting capabilities as a writer most of the character development is either barely apparent or barely passable this means that for johnson she struggles to truly create a sensual film the next is that myself excluded many will see this film for the same reason they read the books its an erotica story but this film is not erotic failing to live up to its most useful purpose    then we get to the central romance now admittedly both actors somewhat struggle with the screenplay given some of the grammatical inaccuracies get transitioned to film making the foreplay much less interesting yes this film does this however what truly sinks this film is the chemistry between the lead actors dakota johnson is actually a very fine actress and she really endevours to work with the terrible script and muddled story even in the first scene her meeting with mr grey she excels in the scripts comical a nice touch by the director elements and shines in the vulnerable moments unfortunately johnson is not matched well on screen jamie dornan is wooden uninteresting and frankly dull as a troubled mr grey he fails to become a truly engaging character and ruins the possibility of the film being even a guilty romance     worse still the film has a terribly unsatisfied rushed conclusion that leaves many threads unresolved this means that you have to wait another year just to see if they get together again which they will as its so damn predictable but i must firmly digress nothing is achieved by having unresolved endings to a film where it doesnt add further intrigue to the ongoing story fifty shades does not do this it leaves you feeling cold and cheated i would be more inclined to have viewed this film if i knew the author had no involvement and the romance was not as shitty    this film achieved the impossible by making erotica boring like the transformers franchise its baffling how something so creative or steamy can become so bland and uninspired with help from the lead actors wooden behaviour shoddy dialogue ridiculous and unrewarding sex scenes an unsatisfying conclusion and the fact that its adapted from e l james miserable novel bury this film beyond hope of redemption whats more ironic is how the films title fifty shades of grey epitomises how youll feel after the credits roll
May 24 2015,negative,this movie is awful the script is terrible that contains cringe worthy dialogue the pace of the movie is horrible the leads bring nothing to the characters and have zero on screen chemistry
May 24 2015,negative,what an utter pile of poo utterly shallow and unconvincing characters whose motivations remain a mystery right through to the unsatisfying ending
May 24 2015,positive,absolutely loved it could have represented the book a little more unseen version is much better
May 24 2015,positive,great to see in theather
May 23 2015,neutral,not that great of a moviedont see what all the fuss was about
May 23 2015,neutral,funny how everyone seems to think this is a movie about sex what i saw was the story of an emotionally damaged man who uses sex as a drug but when he finally experiences what true love is he has no idea how to react to those emotions the story is focused on the drug he chooses when it should be more directly centered on his psychological issue then maybe it would deserve a better rating
May 23 2015,negative,super slow going acting was meh and of course it was nothing like the book 
May 23 2015,positive,better than i thought
May 22 2015,positive,may 22nd 2015  april 7th 2016
May 22 2015,negative,what a terrible movie besides the bad acting
May 22 2015,negative,shockingly cold and sterile
May 22 2015,negative,after all the peoples comments around me i thought it would be better than thisinstead i chuckled more than i watched lol
May 22 2015,positive,even thought they missed so important parts of the movie i still enjoyed it alot i cant wait until fifty shade darker is out
May 22 2015,positive,after 1st hour it became really uninteresting
May 22 2015,negative,superficial soft porn about a try hard dominant  his virgin submissive who reluctantly agrees to be spanked so this idiot will date her zero chemistry
May 21 2015,negative,omg this movie not good the sex is not good 
May 21 2015,positive,i must confess that i enjoyed the book series  are they wellwritten  are they actually literature  no  but they were fun to read  i was worried about the film especially the casting  i did not get to see it in theaters i watched at home  i really did enjoy the film and i thought jamie and dakota had the heat needed  i was not fimiliar with either actor before this but i am now a fan of both
May 21 2015,neutral,ehbet the book is better
May 21 2015,positive,is it really a compliment to say the book was better
May 21 2015,negative,there are probably 50 things wrong with this movie but to summarize its got a nonexistent plot the steamy scenes are alright its got a run time of around 2 hours but you wish it gets over much sooner its probably a fair reflection of how terrible the novel is
May 20 2015,negative,there really isnt anything of interest in this waste of 2 hours i found myself laughing at almost every aspect in this movie
May 20 2015,positive,good movie only if you have read the book otherwise some parts would not make sense
May 20 2015,negative,not good wouldnt recommend to anyone they left a few important parts out that made somethings confusing
May 20 2015,negative,my friends and i watched this film as a joke expecting to laugh at it the entire time we wound up being disgusted and infuriated by it not from the visuals but from the cruel and idiotic characters such an awful film if i could give it zero stars i would
May 20 2015,negative,almost as terrible as i expected it to be
May 20 2015,positive,love it  i have also read the book 4 times
May 19 2015,positive,good movie but a lot of the sex parts where cut out so you have to read the book to know what actually happened 3 out of 5 stars
May 19 2015,negative,the movie was dull and did not live up to the hype a great example that not all popular books should become film adaptations
May 19 2015,negative,50 shades of boring
May 19 2015,positive,fifty shades of grey  was a decent depiction of the book i felt like the actors were holding back on their performances but the material of the book may have had something to do with this what will hollywood allow on screen i didnt sense the passion between the two actors that i felt the characters had in the book i wanted to feel this surrender on both sides that led to their bond the movie does follow the books timeline accurately the story beings when anastasia steele covers for her roommate  best friend to do an interview of christian grey who is a billionaire  publishing giant anastasia  christian immediately are attracted to each other during the interview christian decides to pursue her as christian shows up at her job unannounced  slowly reveals her is not quite the typical businessman anastasia becomes drawn to his dark sexuality when christian reveals his specific sexual tastes anastasia is intrigued  against her own red flags decides to take on this journey of exploration with christian when he shows her a contract he has her sign and a room where she would be staying the formalness of the arrangement sinks in i think the movie should have less focus on the sm relationship as it not considered a psychological illness it is a choice between two consenting adults what is interesting is the psychological journey of both characters how they got to this place in their lives and their need for completion
May 18 2015,negative,should have been a porno
May 18 2015,negative,50 shades of grey has a modest sense of humor but its potentially harmful to the ya audience who are either readingwatching this twilight or divergent the teen pregnancy rate is bound to increase from this overlyerotic piece of crass melodrama
May 18 2015,negative,utter crap with some nudity thrown in to keep people interested
May 18 2015,negative,terrible performances weak story boring and irritating
May 18 2015,positive,i gave in and watched it even though reading everything about it seemed stupid but it could have been worse but now that i seen the first one i want to see the others cause ending was sad  but it was ok i hated the whole butting lip thing all the damn time but it was basically twilight just a little better
May 18 2015,negative,a very over talked about film the film could not bring out the confused state of mind of the characters even though brilliantly shot but the bad fleshing out of the characters make this film an very very average film
May 17 2015,positive,a little on the slow side but an okay movie
May 17 2015,negative,holy hell movie even worse than the book and i didnt get past chapter 1  its almost like porn without the sex zero storyline not a fan of the lead female actress  acting is not convincing in audio only at all  listened to the described movie 
May 17 2015,positive,read the book and the movie version to me wasnt as good not that it isnt good but that it can be better i hated that ending and it makes sense now why people who have never read the book have had the reaction they do this is about a love story but people dont get that they heard about the play room and judged the book by the cover literally since its been awhile since i read the books i felt the movie left some important details out that the viewers who had never read the book needed to be aware of its clear how possessive and narcissistic grey is and that hes got a troubled past he wont share with ana but they couldve elaborated the pain he felt more when she touches him for example the way it was in the book its shown how much he loves her but the movie didnt get to show the viewers how he feels he cant live without her and she cant live without him thats what its ultimately about and it just isnt delivering that message clearly enough to me because i asked if the person who i watched it with if they got that from the movie and they said no they havent read the books so that tells me it needs to be done better
May 17 2015,positive,if i knew that the movie was going to have sequels then i wouldnt have i disliked the ending i love the exual tension throught the movie just got a quarter chub of thinking of some of those scenes  now that i know that theres going to be a part two and maybe three i like the movie now  and the only reason i give a star and a half more now
May 17 2015,negative,what a waste of time
May 17 2015,negative,this movie was absolutely horrible the acting was terrible i enjoyed the book much like many other women but this movie has ruined it and i wish i had never watched it i dont recommend this and i will not be wasting my time watching the next one
May 16 2015,negative,what an awful long horrible movie
May 16 2015,positive,the more i see it the more i love it
May 16 2015,negative,a really boring long and creepy movie slightly better story telling then the book dakota johnson plays the part well but thats the only positive i have to say about this shambles did i mention how creepy this movie is
May 16 2015,negative,i thought the book was bad and this movie is even worst only good thing is sound tracks horrible acting by all from the scale of sexiness compare to  secretary  is 0
May 16 2015,positive,true to the book with minor changes it makes you want to see the next movie
May 16 2015,positive,absolutely loved it cant wait for fifty shades darker im hooked
May 16 2015,positive,i really think that all the hipe that was advertised before this movie came out doesnt even come close to representing this movie  i was very disappointed in the ending and didnt think is was anymore risgay than a daytime soap opera  wasnt worth the money
May 15 2015,negative,slow and boring  good for girls night out
May 15 2015,negative,interestinglaughable love story grey and anas love story is ok the sexual scenes are very unusual the plot is eh i wasnt entertained for the most part i dont know why ana and greys relationship is complicated i hope part 2 gets their relationship fixed and be happy like in the beginning  overall its very dull hard to recommend anyone to watch
May 15 2015,negative,not sure how this is controversial in these times  no chest pooping no body mutilationsigh  if the audience is made up of 13yearolds without internet then this film hit its mark  otherwise difficult to masturbate to
May 15 2015,neutral,i felt this move was boring it needed more meaning to it i understand the fuss about this first film because of the popularity of the book but in my case i found the book much more intriguing than the movie honestly i would not expect a better rating on a second part if released
May 14 2015,positive,i thought the movie was great captivating wondering whats happening next is exciting especially for such a unique storyline a unique storyline it is based on the tons of movies ive seen in my life it is in no way your regular romance story but something special all its own and it definitely can get the blood pressure rising each word look scene music soundtrack is all synced to make you feel their story i loved it especially because ive never seen anything like it quite fascinating in its originality i thought the directors style was spot on im sad to hear another director may be doing the next installment of the trilogy changing up visionariesartists is so a mistake i loved their choice of actors as well good job all in all its a very captivating unusual storyline and will keep you interested the entire time
May 14 2015,neutral,i must admit that i really wanted to see this movie after reading the book  i was intrigued to see how the story would manifest itself on screen  the book trilogy of course has had its critics  however you cant deny that it generated a worldwide frenzy and that it all started with the first book which was also my favorite of the three  50 shades of grey  to me the first book had that intensity and magnetism that was required to get us to even pay attention  yes things were dramatic and outlandish but thats also what captivated us  in turn i was eager to see that play out on the big screen  while i feel the movie succeeded  in some parts i also feel it fell short in others     one strength of the movie were the compelling and accurate sets  for example mr greys office his home his closet his playroom were all very welldone   christian grey played by jamie dornan played broody and mysterious well  just like in the book you were left wondering curious and unsatisfied with the lack of answers and openness from him  anastasia steele played by dakota johnson played awkward well but didnt seem to have the quiet confidence and strength of anastasia i found from the book  there were a few scenes where this was more true such as in the boardroom meeting and at the very end but because it was a bit lacking earlier it seemed a bit out of character when her quiet assuredness did show up    however given the sexual intensity of book perhaps one of the bigger surprises and disappointments was that i did not feel the couple had the electric chemistry on screen that was required  some moments certainly worked but other times it just seemed to fall a little flat  sometimes i felt the movie moved a little too quickly on the subtle momentsgestures that could have increased the films sexiness  the film makers did this a couple times with christians drumming fingers or anas biting lip  but sometimes i felt the sensuality quotient was compromised by a speeding by of certain details or even of dialogue  i guess these moments could have been optimized to serve as foreplay if you will for the viewer      if you read and enjoyed the book its likely you will enjoy the movie  but  i will admit i was hoping for more  lets hope what has been learned from this movie can help guide and improve the creation of the next two movies in the series
May 14 2015,positive,loving it give us more really soon
May 13 2015,positive,i thought the movie was very romantic and done very well i dont understand why there was so much negative reviews it followed the book they did a wonderful job
May 13 2015,positive,havent seen it but im guessing its okay
May 13 2015,negative,lord knows that men have plenty of movies that play into the male fantasy so women are entitled to that as well  this film does that but its title character seems so unlikeable and selfish  if he were a plummer instead of billionaire then it would be downright creepy
May 13 2015,positive,actually a good movie and as a bloke i dont understand what all the other guys out there made all the fuss about   i would watch it again and have said i will go with the wife to see the next one
May 12 2015,negative,garbage in garbage out from books that were best sellers out of titular curiosity comes a movie thats worthless
May 12 2015,negative,a lobotomy is required after watching this
May 12 2015,positive,its was quite a interesting movie
May 12 2015,negative,fairy tale cliche bad acting bad chemistry stupid dialogue
May 12 2015,negative,its like twilight only without the tension and excitement why is it with these movies that a girl is only attractive if she is a virgin has low self esteem and poor the guy has to be muscular rich and mentally broken in some way the movie managed to be worst then the books
May 12 2015,positive,infinitely better than the book i thought it was pretty entertaining
May 12 2015,negative,a tasteless resume of a good book disappointing
May 11 2015,negative,it was lame what was all the hype about
May 11 2015,negative,emotionally stunted garbage
May 11 2015,negative,this is absolutely the worst movie do not waste your time on this crap  there is no story just a few piss poor pg rated sex scenes that we could all do without they even had the audacity to leave some sort of ending that would have you think there will be another movie i demanded every single penny of my money back i will not support this sort of crap from hollywood if its porn you want then watch a porn movie but for the big screen i expect real professional acting or at least an attempt to do so if its a real movie with a real story line then definitely watch something else
May 11 2015,negative,i feel like i am watching a pornography instead of a love story the chemistry between them is piss poor
May 11 2015,negative,my dick didnt get hard once
May 11 2015,positive,i thought it was exactly like the book i thought it was great
May 11 2015,negative,i am one of those women who thoroughly enjoyed the fifty shades books and i must tell you this movie was crap dakota johnson gave a good enough performance but this jamie guy was horrible his dialogue sounded like he was reading from cue cards and even that is being generous the chemistry was not so bad between them but didnt this guy know what kind of movie he signed up for his facial expressions were so fake he looked like he wasnt sure if he should frown or smile his frowns were so obviously fake
May 11 2015,positive,it was amazing loved every second of it
May 11 2015,negative,had none of her job or other things from the book there was no story line just sex
May 11 2015,negative,fifty shades of boredom fifty shades isnt risqué or controversial as the trailers promised the only thing sexy about this film was its soundtrack read more 
May 11 2015,negative,poor movie especially if youve read series of books  quite a let down
May 11 2015,negative,more like fifty shades of boredom
May 11 2015,negative,without wordseven finish watching
May 11 2015,positive,absolutely loved it just wish it was longer and raunchy like in the book
May 11 2015,negative,really bad poor production
May 11 2015,positive,so many horrible reviews  the acting was excellent all playing their roles perfectly i think the reviews were poor because of societies perceptions of love and sex and expectations of what this film represents for us as individuals and for society  for example if someone is expecting a kinky porno then they have obviously come to the wrong place       this movie has more to do with a deeply disturbed man with narcissistic tendencies as he hides his pain through power and control  in christians attempt and need to have power of ana he begins to lose himself along the way  like layers of an onion he did not even realize he had he starts to fear he is losing power over himself  all the while ana is longing for the one thing that unites us alllove  she starts to control him as a result of their mutual feelings which is something he did not expect the power of love cannot be controlled or contained in a simple contract or maintained with such strict rules  this film represents a humans most basic need love  it also shows us the longterm impact child abuse can have shaping our personalities throughout a lifetime       additionally this film is controversial in many regards sadomasochism views are different from person to person powercontrol roles etc also many do not understand sm culture  it exists  power play is real  while for most this kind of sexual experience is new and possibly difficult to understand and grasp since this lifestyle is so controversial in real life      some men and women may be offended by this film taking this movie to represent abuse in relationships which it does  although difficult to view for many because of this i believe cinema is an art form i do not condone violence to anyone ever  i look at this film just as it isa film  it is just another way for us to broaden our horizons in understanding ourselves our perceptions and the way we view life  so lets take a step back and remember that as well
May 10 2015,negative,awful awful awful  i walk out of a movie about once every 5 years  i walked out on this one  the acting is beyond bad way beyond bad  the script is ludicrous  the premise is awful  a beautiful virgin meets a kid who made billions of dollars and five minutes later he tells her he wants her to be his sex slave and she says sure  idiotic beyond belief  what follows is even dumber  there is no ie zero none nada erotic depictions of sex  i was basically laughing at the intense sm sex scenes
May 10 2015,negative,terrible gutwrenching horse shit the half a star is for boobs
May 10 2015,negative,boring do not waste your time poor acting
May 10 2015,negative,what a crappy ending
May 10 2015,positive,i was curious not about the sex scenes i didnt think them controversial when reading the books so the film was bound to be even less so and coincidentally  if you think any of this is controversial you need a long hard critical look at your life but whether or not the director would be able to make something watchable and more sophisticated out of the clusterfck that is the book i have to be honest she did the film is tastefully shot with atmospheric imagery im not talking about the sex scenes even though it applies to those as well but i meant the scenery and surroundings in general and a mostly appropriate and contributing soundtrack my hope for this was sparked funnily enough by the first couple of minutes i saw of the film when it was accidentally started in the cinema where we came to see kingsmen more important than the filmography i didnt want to punch ana in the face the whole time because in the film she wasnt so naive dependent and clueless as in the books the movie version is far less absurd more real and more equal compared to the reading i still cannot believe such bad writing can exist and sell watching was comfortable
May 10 2015,negative,could totally win best comedy of the year really its that pathetic
May 10 2015,negative,unforgivably dull laughable dialogue these characters do not come off at all the way i think theyre supposed to there is no real central conflict no dilemma nothing to really grab onto it feels sort of like watching the same scene over and over the idea of the sex contract is stretched out much too far and the sex itself is neither plentiful or interesting enough to support the 2 hour running time    not bad enough to be funny and about as erotic as the term sex contract i wouldnt recommend it
May 10 2015,negative,if u like really bad porn with even worse dialogue than have i got a movie for you
May 10 2015,negative,i would rate it lower if i could
May 10 2015,negative,whats worth than a bad movie a movie thats boring and bad for a movie about smutty hot sex scenes there was pretty little delivered on that end
May 10 2015,negative,the books were somewhat entertaining the movie was almost like a parody but not funnyand the acting was worse than a high school play
May 10 2015,neutral,a interesting take on a unusual sexual relationship that was engrossing enough to a degree but the acting  especially dornan makes the film seem subpar johnson shows depth and makes you care about her character its worth viewing but definitely not as good as its media hype 05092015
May 10 2015,positive,obviously the book tells an even better story than what you can watch on the screen  most memorable part began when the elevator opens up at the rooftop to find a helicopter waiting  and throughout the whole ride with the music playing what are you waiting for
May 9 2015,positive,i started watching with low expectations because contemporary books made into movies are usually terrible  the clips i saw were bad i was surprised that i loved the movie  that i didnt mind dakota johnson  if you didnt like the books i doubt youll like the movie there was a lot left out of the movie  it seemed a lot more romantic than the books  i recommend the movie if you loved the books like i did note  it ends in a cliffhanger  flixster wouldnt let me share my review earlier
May 9 2015,positive,a softcore porn movie with comedy elements which should not be taken seriously
May 9 2015,neutral,i give it 2 and a half stars just because it is beautifully filmed and for dakota johnson but the story is almost non existent and there is absolutely no payoff
May 9 2015,positive,50 shades of grey is no cinematic masterpiece but the strangest thing about this film is that its surprisingly not bad sure its goofy and slightly draggy at times but the solid chemistry from its two leads more than make up for those flaws its not for the easily or even moderately offended but its worth the curiosity
May 9 2015,negative,just simply a terrible movie direction is horrible but what do you expect from a lousy script they just threw this movie together hoping to make some money off the success of the books how stupid can one be he tells her hes into bondage and dominance and then she gets all pissy when he spanks her what a piece of garbage movie plus the actors had zero sex appeal
May 9 2015,negative,id prefer porn to this junk lead actress is too ugly
May 9 2015,positive,i loved the movie it was more than sex
May 9 2015,positive,didnt live up to the book
May 9 2015,positive,really love this movie so much
May 9 2015,negative,soft porn i witnessed women giggling and laughing at things that werent funny but the soundtrack was decent
May 9 2015,negative,wooden performances cringeworthy and boring this is trash
May 9 2015,positive,it was better than i thought it had more the love story which i like
May 9 2015,neutral,went and saw this movie for a laugh and i read the book to see what all the fuss was about this film hasnt got the sex that was in the book there is no point to making this film
May 9 2015,positive,adult dilemma  love passion and pain twisted tale
May 9 2015,negative,i saw a few parts of this movie hoping to see something hot but instead i got norman bates talking to some chick and then having sex with her off screen i predicted this film would not be a sexy film simply because of the fact hollywood does not want their films to be considered porn this film was boring due to its stupid finance talk lack of normal human emotion in mr grey and      they only show tits in 2 scenes its fucking fifty shades of grey and thats it
May 9 2015,negative,ehsoso  dakota johnson was surprisingly fantastic in the role  i think she nailed it  but the actor for greyehsoso  the movie followed the book well but the grey actor ruined it  absolutely no chemistry between them
May 9 2015,neutral,actually better than expected
May 8 2015,negative,clearly written by an older author that is completely out of touch laters baby who says that this movie is horrible
May 8 2015,positive,ok i liked it i havent seen deeply romantic and heart felt love romance movie like this really long time dakota johnsons cute but her performance was ok james dornan was perfect christian greay i heard he was second choice but his performance was fantastic hes good looking and also looks sad christian has dark secrets so his casting was perfect lots of people didnt like the ending but i saw unrated version with alternate ending i saw little bit longer ending and i liked it lots of european movies are like this maybe movie was not perfect but it was not bad man and woman deeply falls in love but he has dark secrets do you wanna watch it its up to you
May 8 2015,negative,a intriguing story  other than the disturbing nude scenes  and the oof chance this guy probably kills her in the final film   this story isnt going anywhere  and it is just gonna get darker and darker      overall i give it a 2  out of a 5  just due to a somewhat entertaining story  dakota johnson isnt terrible but her surrounding cast is dreadful to watch      if you missed this film  and wanna check it out redbox  or rent    because the cast almost makes this unwatchable    this series can only go up from here 
May 8 2015,positive,i guess im the only one who absolulty loved the movie i read the books first and still loved it
May 8 2015,negative,okay i have to admit fifty shades of grey isnt terrible like many say although undeniably in many ways it is a bad movie being too safe not as hotly ferocious as the book and jamie dorman is undeniably wooden but its well madedirected and i think dakota johnson has got some talent
May 8 2015,positive,50 shades of grey is a provocative movie which pushes the forbidden theme   50 shades of grey does not push the boundry any farther than what is seen on h b o with cable and internet smut i wonder if the public has been  desensitized  well written and directed the storylines character development intrigues the viewer with mystery  shades story diverts into sexually charged scenes which digresses into desecratation which evloves into relationship conflict fifty shades of grey  hits the standards of mystery forbidden love boy losses girl can the relationship be saved genre 4 stars a swanky love story
May 8 2015,positive,awesome couldnt take my eyes off the screen cant wait for the second i laughed cheered best dvd eva bought
May 8 2015,negative,after reading the book im disappointed at the movie thats all i must say
May 8 2015,negative,casting was bad acting was bad plot was bad the whole idea of this moviebook was just bad only good thing about this movie was the cinematography like the piano scene but even that cant make up for how bad this movie wasis
May 8 2015,negative,uh oh and im still trying to figure out the big attraction that the masses found when they paid money to see this in a cinema not really erotic and certainly not a smart or realistic depiction  of the human psychology involved in bdsm not at all good and yet this made millions go figure
May 8 2015,positive,good somewhat dissapointed in grey portrayal
May 8 2015,positive,as a movie this was a good movie with a good plot  and the acts were exciting  her book character i heard was annoying   initially she was but she got better and blend very well  i enjoyed this
May 7 2015,negative,1 hour 50 mins too long
May 7 2015,positive,i hope theres a sequel to this movie 
May 7 2015,negative,worst movie ever so painful to watch
May 7 2015,negative,terrible movie terrible story and no real good nudity sex scenes where terrible  another tale of a woman trying to change a man and a man who doesnt do romance seems to do it pretty well
May 7 2015,negative,well thats pretty tame
May 6 2015,neutral,dakota is more monotone than kristen stewart this movie was hard to sit through from being just plain boring the only reason i went to see it was to see how it compared to the book and boy was it bad still worth seeing so you can know for yourself that it was bad
May 6 2015,negative,i absolutely loved the book and when they said a movie was being made based on the book i thoughtwowbut how do you make a movie based on a book with such vivid sexual passion that can be seen at the moviesi guess you cant it was a huge disappointment theres obviously going to be a fifty shades darker pleeeeease do better or dont put the movie out in theaters
May 5 2015,neutral,wow that was crappy and dont know what all the hype was about
May 5 2015,positive,i liked it but im going to read the book do see what i missed
May 5 2015,negative,50 shades of disappointing
May 5 2015,negative,05 a star for the title
May 5 2015,negative,he is not christian grey
May 4 2015,neutral,if christian grey exercises control in all things one can only hypothesize about why he chose to be portrayed by the worst actor hollywood has entertained in the past decade when watched on mute this film could easily be mistaken for a horrorslasher genre based solely on the expressionless public masturbator face sported by jamie dornan throughout the majority of the frustrated housewife plot though outright idiotic at times points should be awarded for originality and riskiness an unpredictable ending except of course by the upper echelon who read the book first leaves an uncomfortable artsy feeling which might be the sole justifiable reason for taking 2 hours out of your life to see this
May 4 2015,negative,pervy hot billionaire playboy takes an inexplicable interest in a mousy noseinclassicliterature collegeage virgin she gets whitegirl wasted he comes to the rescue in a helicopter then he shows her his playroom seriously who writes this inane housewife porn who thinks this is sexy this is a movie for white women who have never had sex and have no hope of having any fifty shades of hooha  juvenilesexualattitudes intimacyissues goodluck
May 4 2015,negative,any teenage relationship drama could have done the trick what a tragedy letting adults act this way i could have got the same message from pitch perfect without the raunchy details of a sociopathic lifestyle seems like a narcissist wonderland so if your into all that self gratifying stuff go see this banal
May 4 2015,negative,not much content just like a porn
May 4 2015,positive,i must admit i didnt hate it but in other way i hate both stars performances like i hate twilight and again but i like its bravery to bring the bdsm material kudos for el james not the movie
May 3 2015,positive,this is like an adult version of twilight quite as bad too
May 3 2015,negative,it was so bad idk what to write  just horrible i rather watch that one mariah carey movie or reruns of the kardashians
May 3 2015,positive,another valentines day come and gone also st pattys went by in a blur i know i said i would post a review of this movie by valentines 2015 but things just got in the way maybe i just didnt want to be that guy who watches bad movies and bitches about it on the internets but the experience draws in readers just so you know i did watch fifty shades of grey on valentines day and i probably should have consumed a glass of wine or beer beforehand like fellow critic christy lemire had done fyi her review is the best    to watch fifty shades of grey is almost like a dare dare to watch a bad movie or dare to watch a movie about bondage and sadomasochism the funny thing is that such sexual acts are looked down upon and now we have a mainstream movie about the very act the majority condemn whats even more funny is that i dare to defend this movie from all the naysayers the ones who dismiss this movie because it opens the doors to the velvet underground    this movie was incredibly tame and yet people were up in arms about the whole ordeal like theyve never heard of such depravity its amazing that sex is still a touchy topic to this day and i was equally as amazed when i pointed this out back in 2006 when i reviewed the notorious bettie page see also my 2013 review of the todo list the bigger the budget the higher the controversy i guess everyone keeps overlooking the contract beween mr grey and ana and the two have to work out a mutual agreement before fucking in short its all consensual but there is that one part that seems to rub people the wrong way which i argue is almost the right response to illicit but some folk take it further by being offended    but fifty shades of grey isnt a landmark motion picture it wants to be as evident by its glossy presentation characters dressed sharp walk in sterile environments and have clean sex even if its supposed to be unusual heck even the trailer hyped this up to be way more than it should i was sold even though i scoffedit was also because of that horrible redux of beyonces otherwise brilliant crazy in love nay fifty shades of grey is a punchline it started off as a punchline a twilight fanfiction so there really is no reason to take it seriously dare to watch a bad movie this is your ticket    however i am intrigued that a mainstream movie dares to make certain sexual acts mainstream more often than not the act itself is resorted to a punchline or underlying psychological disorder or viewed in a seedy grindhouse where travis bickle and betsy are on a first date getting schooled in sexual education just think to watch fifty shades of grey back in 1975 wouldve ended a relationship maybe your date wouldve thought you were crazy you mightve even gone to jail for watching such filth    though bdsm is also viewed as unnatural by our leading lady ana or anastasia dakota johnson shes essentially the good girl trying to tame the bad boy its like that one song that goes why do good girls like bad boys she plays into mr greys sexual obsessions almost right away she says he was intimidating but was drawn to him like she made it her personal mission to find out exactly what made him tick or why he is so enamored by her    ana is rather a blank character which i noted from the first five minutes shes such a square and i suspect many audiences are particularly the ones who recoil to see mr grey playfully spank ana because she playfully bit her own lip which is against one of his rules mr grey wasnt any better except looking good for the camera he remains guarded which somewhat explains the characters shortcomings a rather interesting scene is when he actually opens up to ana but he was only able to while she was asleep the movie hints at his dark past but this entry doesnt explain it so well have to find out in the upcoming sequels    for about two hours they do more than just fuck mr grey indulges ana in the fine escapades of the high life so there are more ways these two oddlypaired consenting adults connect its painfully drawn out its sweet even if its cheesy i think the word that should be stressed is fantasy most fantasies dont take a whole lot of creativity especially when it comes to sex show a little skin play up the meek and dangerous personalities materialized by typically two attractive people maybe fifty shades of grey is more of a modern fairy tale but with fucking you go ooo and ahh and aww and then maybe gasp a few times     im sure it was all intentional to make this dark sexual world more appealing to the curious its weird sure but somewhat fascinating knowing that people keep leather whips and chains oh my and other assortments to act out their fantasies and finally heres a movie that sheds light on a topic that was placed in the special interests sections at a video store or shown on latenight cinemax there was another movie about sex lars von triers twopart epic nymphomaniac it showed here in albuquerque but only at the guild and only at night fifty shades of grey played at chain theaters that had no qualm showing it during the day yet the sex is merely a conduit for the romance set to bloom that was the other reason why this movie is fitted for mainstream    long story short fifty shades of grey was okay do what film critic christy lemire did have some wine watch the movie with some friends and giggle all the way through seriously read her review its really all you can do giggle like its the first time looking through a nudie magazine because it is and it does feel like the first mainstream movie about sex since american pie only less funny but more unintentionally funny winwin i guess    but i dunno one month later no ones really talking about fifty shades of grey i made my review to make it seem like its a landmark cultural event but its not its a punchline now everyone knows how the joke goes perhaps it overstayed its welcome like bart simpsons i didnt do it catchphrase we need something new    woozle wuzzle
May 3 2015,positive,was expecting so much more from this movie its ashamed the books gets so much hype then the movie comes out and no one talks about it oh well thats what happen when you make a movie from a book that doesnt need it
May 3 2015,negative,entry level bdsm set within the trappings of those awful turn of the millennium romantic comedies
May 2 2015,negative,it would be way better if lars von trier made it
May 2 2015,positive,a really great movie i can not wait for the other two books to become movies
May 2 2015,negative,1 for the cinematographer
May 2 2015,negative,this movie was horrible
May 2 2015,negative,must say not the best film much like its books lacked life and meaning unlike its counterpart in the form of the secretary and the duke of burgundy it lacked chemistry and meaning behind the use of bondage to learn about it more in depth one should read the manga nana to kauro which displays more meaning behind the act and that it is not just a blindless act of toys one good thing about it is its soundtrack
May 2 2015,positive,i dont know why this movie got such bad reviews i actually enjoyed it quite a bit it reminds me of the movie 9 12 weeks with mickey rourke and nicole kidman
May 2 2015,positive,i laughed i cried i loved this movie has everything suspense action drama and most importantly love every breath whip and teardrop taken i felt it as if i was therei am grateful that theres finally a film that is not porn but actually a true love story that we all could enjoy and learn from the book and the movie both gave the same sensational feeling that only this love story can take me this movie is the perfect dating movie thatll guarantee you to get laid and even the best family bonding movie that you wont even be embarrassed watching with your mother cant wait for the next sequel fifty shades darker and fifty shades freed    455 not enough grey
May 1 2015,negative,not as good as i thought
May 1 2015,negative,this is a terrible movie  the sex scenes are incredibly unimaginative and boring  the characters are both incredibly unlikable have no chemistry and if either character had any sense they would never see one another again
May 1 2015,positive,just like the book  love it
May 1 2015,negative,very long and boring movie
May 1 2015,negative,disapointing theres no goal no story theres not even a decent erotic scene in this the reason why people watch this movie
May 1 2015,negative,finally watched the movie as a huge fan of the books i was very disappointed jamie dornan did not have the dominance the book portrayed and dakota johnson im sorry to say she wasnt very convincing as the virgin ana the acting was horrible and the script was just as bad needless to say i wont watch this movie again nor will i watch the sequels
Apr 30 2015,negative,i feel creeped out and this could easily be turned into a horror
Apr 29 2015,negative,uninteresting plot flat characters sucky ending the book was way better
Apr 29 2015,positive,the ending sucked  good movie over all
Apr 29 2015,negative,a film about sex where you dont actually see very much sex this adaptation of el james novel certainly lives up to its title fifty shades of grey as in dull dakota johnson is the one good thing about this film  gives a solid committed performance as ana steele however someone really needs to tell jamie dornan that theres more to acting than just scowling in front of the camera for 2 long hours hed probably have been better off focusing on making sure he was wearing his trousers in that way a film about sex that isnt at all sexy
Apr 28 2015,neutral,the love between the two characters r very touching it actually surprises me
Apr 28 2015,positive,is it a great movie  no  but is it great porn especially for women  nods vigorously  if youre a woman who is frustrated with the lack of storyline and romance in porn well here you go and el james says youre welcome    it also comes with a side of gateway bdsm for people who arent really into bdsm and for those critics whining about how psychotic and disrespectful grey is to anastasia  a  go watch any other porn thats out there then come back falling at christian greys feet for how much of a gentleman he is in comparison and b  the bdsm community actually enforces consensual sex more than the average alcoholbarclubfuelled courtship  read     thank you to a good friend who recommended fifty shades to me  would i read the book  no  is the film version a great sexytime movie  hell yes
Apr 28 2015,positive,at times mrgrey comes across as a bling bling flashy turnoff and anastasia being in a state of firstlove can come across as frustrating lol  reminded me a bit of bella swan and edward cullen but twilight is obviously 10 times better to watch 
Apr 28 2015,positive,enjoyable not as bad as everyone says everyone just expected too much
Apr 27 2015,negative,is it possible to give 0 stars this is equivalent to a frivolous lawsuit literally a frivolous movie this is the proof you can hash out any crap in hollywood and some sheeple will still flock to it with their cash    50 shades of stupid
Apr 27 2015,negative,found this very hard to watch  story is weak and the acting is lame
Apr 27 2015,positive,loved it followed the book very well âºï
Apr 27 2015,neutral,it was okay didnt play in with the bdsm lifestyle but the is the authors fault  the acting was subpar
Apr 26 2015,positive,i was pleasantly surprised that i liked this movie i thought that id only like the naughty scenes but i actually got into the story line as well and i cant wait for the second one to come out and yes i learned a few new tricks for my love life too rawr
Apr 26 2015,neutral,i can see why everyone loves the storyline to this movie but the sex was way over the top definitely for the people that are into kinky stuff
Apr 26 2015,negative,boring too talkative and lacking any direction fifty shades of grey is a disappointing adaptation of the femaletargeting kin bestseller of el james surrounded by all the hype coming from the books success the movie fails to be anything more than a nicely calculated cash machine pretending to be bondage kinky romance fifty shades of grey is nothing but an impotent wannabebdsm melodrama that utterly annoys  anastasia steele dakota johnson a college graduate meets the young and ultra successful businessman christian grey jamie dornan during an interview she does for her best friend an immediate spark flies between them and from that moment el james romantic melodrama starts the beginning is intriguing and not bad at all until nothing actually happens throughout the movie overlong dialogues and lame depiction of restrained passion sam taylorjonshons delivery is far from being even partially engaging what totally ruins the movie is that the biggest asset of el james story the bdsm and kinky elements are totally softened and replace by a boring softcore scenes and completely artificial dialogues   it would definitely take some nerves to get through the final credits with little to enjoy or to appreciate fifty shades of grey is a poor delivery that could have been a major improvement of its source material if it had been naughtier and kinkier
Apr 25 2015,positive,for people slating this film  get real if this film was as graphic as the books you would be watching porn  this movie was made for the cinemas not the blue movie scene its a love story with some kinky bits  thats it i personally feel they played the parts well  and i look forward to the next ome
Apr 25 2015,negative,what a tedious boring catastrophe the acting is unbearably bad the sm scenes were dull and the film is terrible to the tenth degree
Apr 25 2015,positive,watched it with my wife didnt read the book it was mildly entertaining but soft core porn is better
Apr 25 2015,negative,d  well below average
Apr 24 2015,negative,two good looking people one rich another not so much  like to have sex a lot  duh  oh and there is a contract on how they wanna do it
Apr 24 2015,positive,loved it  cant wait for the other two movies to come out
Apr 24 2015,negative,if there is one thing fifty shades of grey proves its that hollywood has no interest in catering to the female gaze  even when making a film that is supposed to be a female erotic fantasy ignoring the issues that exist with the story and the misrepresentation of sm practices this is a film that refuses to accept what it is all the sex scenes which are devoid of anything resembling titillation focus almost exclusively on the body of dakota johnson even with a female team behind the camera the heterosexual male gaze cannot be quashed when in comes of jamie dornan the film is down right prudish we get to see almost nothing of his physique with the camera quickly shying away from even a brief glimpse of his bare ass no such reservations exist where johnson is concerned we get to see her naked in all her glory being restrained and whipped even if both are too tamed to shock or titillate fifty shades of grey shows a fundamental misunderstanding of heterosexual female desire which is made more problematic with a target audience of straight women and on behind the camera maybe its because everyone knows this is the epitome of trash and they are just collecting a paycheck dornan in particular looks like hes sucking on a lemon the whole film and is only there because the producers have some solid blackmail material on him dakota johnson is the only one who manages to escape the energy sucking mess she takes the mess in stride realizing fifty shades for what it is a chance to make a lot of money and get herself noticed she delivers lines that make george lucas look like a great writer of romance like shes in on the joke she knows shes making trash and shes going to have fun with it johnsons efforts cant make fifty shades good there is no power on earth that can manage that feat but she does make it bearable even when she is reduced to writhing around restrained and naked
Apr 24 2015,positive,the movie perfectly shares thoughts on nature of human sexuality desire of finding true love regardless our race religion or class  psychologically speaking if we ourselves were put in mr greys situation sexually and emotionally abused by his family and a family friend at a young age  if anyone studies psychology you will know theres a great chance that people will develop that sort of disorder behavior  fortunately most of us are like ana live in a normal life and a sociality where people dont talk about sexuality openly   its kind of sad if people cant explore the real self
Apr 24 2015,positive,ummi liked it even though the dialogue was kind of horrible at times it wasinteresting though and i like these types i guess hahahah ps i really like dakota johnson now after seeing this and i thought she was actually a pretty decent actress jamie dornan on the other hand felt like he was reading off a page the whole time which was kind of funny the movie felt like it was unintentionally hilarious at times which usually would have me giving this an a in the bmovie categories or movies so bad that theyre good it is good but nothing i would recommend to anyone unless youre into movies that are so bad that theyre goodlike the twilight movieswhich this happens to be a fan fiction based partly on that material oo
Apr 24 2015,neutral,sexy the main two actors did better than expected  the ending sucked still not as good as the book which is only moderately better
Apr 24 2015,negative,false idea of bdsm false idea of a perfect man rich borderline possessive buys you a car etc etc was it supposed to be erotic
Apr 23 2015,negative,note i never read the book and this film does not encourage  me to well where to beginlets start with  this is nothing more than propaganda to demonize the bdsm community you expect me to believe an english literature major with a 40 had to google submissive caring for her new beau with broken foot kept her mom from flying and ana doesnt call her out on this then she meets this enigmatic billionaire by the most cliched deus ex machina who stalks his way into her heart and then drives her away with his bdsm fetish this wasnt written by some one with a clear understanding of the fetish world if they did theyd have already seen secretary and not filmed this garbage i want to take a second to speak of the boggling use of color in this film the color screaming the mood theme and emotion so loudly that i thought i was missing something in hero the use of color helps tell the story but here its hitting me over the head with things i already know because i pay attention to the story on par with that is christian greys wardrobe between his mom the fifteen other women ana herself and all the boys at the gym and country club grey would have a more diverse wardrobe not only that but he forces this drab sense of fashion on all his employees his offices remind me of the world of equilibrium in which both feelings and artistic expression are outlawed and citizens take daily injections of drugs to suppress their emotions the whole my last name is grey so thats my motif went out with 1980s saturday morning cartoons had his last name been cowslip or steppenwolf   the sex how can you poorly edit a sex scene by tying someone up two different ways at two different moments and chopping the footage up into a montage so now it seems like theyre constantly doing some tying and untying now well skip the part where they omit the montage of them exploring each others deviant desires the way real couples do and go right to where grey throws a tantrum about ana goin to georgia then flies out to see her only to have to rush back because of work   pti but i want to take a second to question what grey does it said he was a telecommunications billionaire but never says what exactly he does to make such wealth does he own isps build communications networks or did me just buy in to pre established industries but thats not the point of this movie right  why is grey purposefully vague about who hes having dinner with what in their relationship would make her not trust him was he pissed she went to georgia and did it to get back at her hes an enigmatic billionaire with holdings all over the globe im sure hed understand some one having to leave suddenly on a plane at that   and then we get to the end so shes gonna break up with him because shes fallen in love with him but not his bdsm fetish which theyd been exploring the entire time right  pti but exactly how much time passed in this movie she wasnt graduated then we watch her graduate then she goes to georgia then their back in seattle or is it portland and then they break up how long were they dating and why is ana not famous for dating a billionaire thats not the point of this movie i know  so why did it take ana all this time to figure out this wasnt the kind of thing she wanted why didnt her oh this is what he meant by you dont wanna love me light come on and she just leave  which brings me to my conclusion the moral of the story is true love is suppose to conquer all written by someone who doesnt understand how fetishes work they are not repeat not defensive mechanisms used to ward off intimacy christian grey is an emotional toddler who would react the same way if his mommy remarried as he did when ana went to georgia shes a virgin like its suppose to be revolutionary named after the folktale about a princess who has to go into hiding only to later reclaim her throne  a hardened alloy hes named after a pious religion and the color of neutrality its so cliche it was fore shadowed by the lighting hes suppose to change for her her innocence and love will change him hawyuck hawyuck hawyuck  it should be noted i only watched this film to write this review
Apr 23 2015,positive,love this movie cant wait for it to come out on dvd
Apr 22 2015,negative,yup thats what all the fuss was about
Apr 21 2015,negative,painful too watch lol
Apr 21 2015,positive,i love the movie but i want to see a happy ending
Apr 19 2015,positive,good movie but i like the book more
Apr 19 2015,negative,dont bother with the movie read the book
Apr 18 2015,positive,the book series is one of my guilty pleasures and the movie does a decent job adapting the first novel making few if any missteps the stars are attractive and the dialogue never feels stiff or forced despite el jamess awful lines plus the movie is reasonably wellpaced theres not much to complain about they could have cast someone more menacing and dark to play christian but jamie dornan does a good job
Apr 18 2015,negative,i dont think that was i good movie to see
Apr 17 2015,negative,the hype killed this transparent story of subtle ta but it doesnt go allin on shock value or story dramatics leaves it wanting
Apr 17 2015,negative,boring waste of time the worst thing about this movie  boring
Apr 17 2015,neutral,for all the pre release fuss it is actually really tame and harmless its better than it truly could have been but then thats not saying much really considering the book it is based on  the main guy would be good in a terminator film because he is so emotionless and robotic the main lady however stands out because she brings warmth and charm to a role that could have been a bit stereotypical
Apr 16 2015,positive,i was really excited about this movie i was on edge the entire timegrabbing my boyfriends arm because of all the sexual tension between the two i think all the excitement was because i loved the book so much but like most books turned into movies it just did not live up to what i expected
Apr 16 2015,negative,i wanted to see this movie and gave it every chance the movie lacked luster and even with my stanch presbyterian upbringing i could find few sins in this movie truth is i never read the book so i was untainted with all the hype it should have been an easy do i was never shocked and always bored
Apr 15 2015,positive,im very disappointed because after reading and listening to the critics i wanted to give zero stars to this movie i have to say sadly that this is not the worst movie ive ever watched i think it captures the essence of the book which again is not my favourite as the book the story line is pretty simple and straight forward and also not new although the movie wraps it up decently getting better and better toward the end the female character grows as fast the the male declines the first 20m though those are really dumb 3 out of 5 i think is a pretty good unbiased score coming from me
Apr 14 2015,negative,wasnt as good as the book was expecting more to be honest dreading part 2
Apr 13 2015,negative,well that was the least satisfying story about sm that ive ever heard  its a fail on every level which is sort of amazing considering the subject matter  for the original mr grey check out secretary his character is edward grey  id recommend it to anyone who would like a deeper character study about sm partners and their oddly endearing way of finding happiness
Apr 13 2015,negative,plays out to a robotic style interesting but never more than that totally lacks a sensual feel and any believable desire
Apr 13 2015,neutral,i never read the books but i heard how hot and steamy they are  i dont see what all the hype is about i did not find it to be hot at all  maybe that came across in the books it certainly did not follow through to this movie  lame
Apr 13 2015,negative,i wasnt even interested in watching this movie but i was curious what all the hype was so i watched it    what a waste of time and movie dialogues were stupid and boring even one of the lines felt like it was taken from the twilight books and movies which then i found out that fifty shades of grey was actually a twilight fan fiction so the author used edward and bella as the main characters but then change their names to actually make the book of fifty shades of grey no wonder the dialogues sucks im a big fan of twilight but this is movie is crap    then you have this bdsm which makes me ask why would the author come up with this crap with edward and bella its not something i would read    what i dont like is how people think the book is great and is romantic and hot i never read 50 shades of grey but after seeing the movie how can anyone think this is a love story yeah ana falls in love with the guy and yeah the guy had his romantic moments but like he said he doesnt do romance and was just being nice to ana so he can f her thats not a love story ladies and im a girl saying that twilight is a love story    i also think its funny how no one can see that christian is messed up on the head since they are so focus on his charms and how he f really he basically got sexual abused at age of 15 years old and through 6 years by his moms friend doing bdsm to the point that now he does this to any girls who sign his damn contract thats not hot thats sick clearly the man needs help    horrible movie as i expected if you want to watch it for the love story which there isnt any skip this movie and go watch twilight the notebook or any other romance movies if you want to see it cause of the sex scenes dont bother you are better off watching porn than this crap
Apr 13 2015,negative,the half star was for jamie dornans ass which as beautiful as it is could not save this horrible mess of a thing from itself everything about this film save the aforementioned ass was just bad but the very worst thing oddly was the soundtrack as pointless as the story was the music made the film a parody of itself
Apr 12 2015,positive,dont really know what to say about this movie from what i heard about the book made me want to see it after watching it i was disappointed
Apr 12 2015,neutral,it wasnt terrible i had read the first couple pages of the book and found the writing to be insufferable but i also fully expected the screenplay to iron out the kinks heh like with the twilight movies which had better material to work with in comparison anastasia is still a little unnecessarily inept and vapid at first and dakota johnson oversells her mousiness but she proves herself a subtle comedienne in the hardware store and drunken voicemail scenes    jamie dornan is sufficiently sexy and tortured and predatory but the script is careful to make sure anas free will is at the forefront of every decision though some may argue its the illusion of freedom because shes so inexperienced and hes so persistent even so that doesnt make her decisions any less her own nor his lust any less an earnest desire for connection in the only depraved way he knows how its a problematic relationship dynamic to be sure and theres really only one harlequin fantasy way to end it but so far the representation seems unmannered and unfettered heh
Apr 12 2015,negative,being the great husband that i am i let my wife put this on and even watched it with her after all i am a movie lover and movie lovers should be open minded i think we watched an asian version which seemed to have had edited sex scenes and in a way i am glad because the film was already far too long at 2 hours i am honestly confused i do not understand what the fuss is all about at all with regards to the books and now the movie i have not read the books but i am assuming they are similar to the story in the film if so it just does not make sense at all this guy is a freak why would anyone who has 1 of human brains would let him even touch you anal fisting a room full of weird toys can not sleep with someone at night though and you are ok with that i suppose there are some sexual freaks out there fart porn anyone but this movie just annoyed me it had potential i thought it was going somewhere and that there would be a massive reveal to why he is such a sick fuck but there wasnt anything worth waiting for at the end i think i will avoid watching any sequels sorry wife
Apr 12 2015,positive,    curious thats got to be the most apt publicity tagline for a me for a movie ever its not that i was curious about the content per say i was curious as to what the fuss was all about why are so many people so rabidly into this story i had to know no way on earth would this ever be my kind of movie but a phenomenon this big is hard for me to ignore plus i had a coupon    i dont need to explain the very thin plot to you do i no okay moving on ill admit there was a lot that fascinated and intrigued me about this film it raised many questions about relationship roles as well as trust and expectations a lot of it had me really thinking in a way that stuck with me most of the rest of the day let me set things straight i was pondering things not fantasizing philosphically different what part of their relationship was okay vs what should have been a red flag to send anastasia running out the door what would i be willing to put up with vs whats going too far    because for such a highly coveted romance they really dont have a lot of substance there like any other movie relationship the two inexplicably fall desperately in love immediately they cant even bear to go a couple hours from each other gag and for someone who claimed to be so devoted to his girl mr grey really does put a lot of unfair and arguably abusive and manipulative pressure on her those are the sorts of things i was thinking about    as far as the kink its my understanding that its not a very accurate representation of the culture ive been told that it should be based on trust and that the open honesty and communication necessary to make it work make for a very solid relationship that was not here whatsoever would i ever wanna read the book umm no besides the fact that its amateurishly written i feel if i really wanted to know about such things thered be much better sources still though id rather reread lotr    im coming off pretty negative there was some fun to it yes jamie dornan was incredibly hot and while dakota johnson is a little green as an actress she did have a likability its my understanding that the screenplay smartened things up a bit although much came off as very dumb without having read it though i could always tell when a line of dialogue must have been taken verbatum from the source it was usually the really silly sounding lines that were meant to be sexy often delivered in a fairly deadpan manner inappropriate giggles broke out in the audience it was a fun fantasy to escape to as long as you didnt pay too much attention to the details    would i see it again not any time soon a couple days after i was at the movies with a friend our intended flick was cancelled due to a leaky roof in the auditorium her first suggestion would you see fifty shades again no i resounded quite forcefully we saw imitation game instead much better choice    fifty shades of grey  m m m        
Apr 12 2015,negative,about as sexy as a dirty ashtraydialogue that actually made me laugh out loud and acting so wooden after ten minutes i wanted to varnish the castanyone looking for porn would be better off watching babe station and anyone wanting a story is better off reading a book no not that book    to give it credit it did keep me watching tho mainly as my girlfriend had the remote
Apr 12 2015,positive,loved it every one complains that its  not like the book that there wasnt enough sex scenes ect i love the love story behind it all and yeah they might have changed several details but the big picture is perfectly clear for those people that thought there should have been more to the sex scenes or that there wasnt enough go by a pornographic video and youll get exactly what you want
Apr 12 2015,negative,a stupid story makes for a stupid filmdisgusting
Apr 12 2015,negative,emotiionally disturbing wkwkwk
Apr 11 2015,negative,a quarter for the soundtrack and the other quarter left goes to making me laugh more than most comedies
Apr 11 2015,negative,you know when youre watching a generic horror film theres always a bunch of boring talky scenes near the start where youre being introduced to the characters and nothing really happens imagine two really boring characters  one an impossible dullard of a girl who would probably fall for the nigerian prince email scam the other an awkward creepy oftenunintelligible perpetually worriedlooking man with an utterly laughable accent  and now imagine spending two brainmeltingly dull hours with them as they do essentially nothing before the film randomly ends just when it seemed like it was about to go somewhere thats fifty shades of grey an experience which is on every single level from top to bottom illconceived  it earns microscopic praise only for being fleetingly unintentionally funny oh and surely it goes without saying that anyone who finds this gibberish to be romantic needs their fucking head examined
Apr 11 2015,negative,the actors really made me despise this movie 
Apr 11 2015,negative,what a cinematic accomplishment theyve made a movie that revolves around sex absolutely boring  but the guy is hot i give them that
Apr 11 2015,neutral,could have been a lot better without the sex scenes that contributed absolutely nothing
Apr 11 2015,positive,with good performances from the films unknown leads fifty shades of grey is provacative as well as also bringing emotion as it pushes the boundaries of satisfaction
Apr 11 2015,negative,to be fair i didnt watch the whole movie i got bored 20 minutes in i didnt think the movie could be as flat and unrealistic as the book but was proved wrong
Apr 11 2015,negative,although dakota johnson gives it all and sam taylorwoods direction makes it all more bearable than its print counterpart the horrible premise worsened by poor writing robs fifty shades of grey of almost all entertainment that one can find in this messy and ludicrous film
Apr 11 2015,negative,to much hype for this film very disappointing
Apr 11 2015,negative,its a comedy film i didnt think it would be any good and it wasnt the dialogue was so poor the story line is complete rubbish
Apr 10 2015,negative,210  terrible script and acting apart from dakota johnson her performance and the cinematography were good but are unable to save the film from its lazy script full of holes and awful dialogue
Apr 10 2015,positive,the movie is beautifully shot thanks to seattle portland  vancouver and the director did excellent it is a very good movie and explores the subject in a good way cant wait for  fifty shades darker
Apr 10 2015,neutral,the concept was stupid from the start
Apr 9 2015,negative,with dakota johnsons dependable performance and the films keen eye and direction 50 shades of grey is probably as close to a normal good movie as it can be coming from its inept source material but sadly it is still not enough to please many outside of fans of the book
Apr 9 2015,positive,after reading all the bad reviews i was pleasantly surprised i didnt go in with the expectation that the movie would follow even close to the book tho after all the book was quite descriptive and would have to be a porn if the movie were to be even remotely close the movie did follow the baseline of the book tho the chemistry between christian and ana was enough to hold my attention also i will be in the theater for any future fifty shades movies
Apr 9 2015,neutral,this was not so bad as i thought   jamie dorman plays a charming and tormented christian greyand thats it ive never read and nerver will read the book but from what i heard this was an upgrade
Apr 9 2015,negative,bad film felt very rushed acting was terrible and the bloke is to innocent to be anything but boring
Apr 9 2015,positive,good movie could have followed the book more especially if they are going to make a sequel they are missing so many key elements of the book that are needed for the next two movies 
Apr 8 2015,neutral,in my opinion it left the movie just hanging it was like not even seeing the ending at all they could have shown her life years later otherwise i would have given the movie a higher rating
Apr 8 2015,positive,it wasnt as good as i thought it would be after reading the books
Apr 8 2015,positive,grey i dont make lovei fuckhard    it was decent just porn you can watch in the theater i wouldnt watch it again but if your into that kind of stuff then go for it
Apr 8 2015,negative,im asking shorty sign a contract lmao
Apr 8 2015,negative,fifty shades of grey is more of a state rather than a fullcircled story confusing turns and missleading direction doesnt help its dull leads either but it sertainly can bring out the laughs
Apr 8 2015,positive,really good if havent read the book a bit of a let down if you did noticeably jumps around quite a bit overall good
Apr 8 2015,negative,so bad so physically and emotionally abusive this movie was awful and i wished to leave the theatre but didnt want to waste the 20 which i had spent on rpx the acting was definitely cringeworthy and the main actress made me want to punch my teeth out
Apr 7 2015,negative,not even really bad sex scenes there are worse scenes in game of thrones its kid appropriate compared to game of thrones lmao
Apr 7 2015,positive,i loved this movie like so much it was better than i heard
Apr 7 2015,positive,surprised to enjoy this and not find the sex scenes too much
Apr 7 2015,negative,very bad ive wasted 45 min of my life
Apr 7 2015,negative,this isnt as bad as i thought it was it is not good but certainly isnt horriblethe acting is finethe writing is mediocre but they had a lot of potential and they kind of played it safei didnt hate this movie its not good its just mediocreoverall 50 shades of grey is a medicore movie that is wasted potential    grade c
Apr 7 2015,positive,i was made to watch this film not reading the books i am not sure what all the critics are on about or the people giving it 1 star i thought the film was great and cant wait to see the others
Apr 6 2015,negative,a film based on a novel written solely from the wishful thinking and fantasies of some enormous toad of a ladysomehow this drove the little rebellious minds of the teenage girls crazy around the world
Apr 6 2015,negative,having been utterly distracted by the 413 times dakota johnson bit her lip throughout the movie i can not accurately review this film though im fairly sure it was horrible
Apr 6 2015,positive,i loved it was amazing
Apr 6 2015,negative,past the twenty minute mark my cliché limit was already going through the roof and i was finding the acting pretty poor the scene when they meet is especially bad as johnson doesnt seem very believable in uneasy awkward or embarrassed it gets a little better but by the end i was left thinking i had just watched the college girls twilight just replace the vampire with a money driven suit wanker with fifty shades of grey suits and grey german cars who gets off spanking college girls
Apr 6 2015,positive,having not read the books i went with a relatively open mind  i thought 50 shades of grey was an excellent relationship film with believable nuances and and story lines the fact that reviewers were less than impressed with the engaging and fascinating romance leaves me with even less respect for them dekota johnson was outstanding and jamie dornan was excellent as well
Apr 6 2015,negative,holy shit wasted 2 hours should have gone for my root canal
Apr 6 2015,neutral,whilst i actually really enjoyed a lot of this film and was engrossed pretty much throughout waiting for an insight into why the characters are the way they are it never came i literally learned nothing and then the movie ended pretty much mid sentence i despise films that do this i hate this new thing movies seem to be doing more and more often if turning one film into two now i have to wait a year or more to see any more which is just stupid and will detract from the overall experience its a shame as i enjoyed the film far more than i thought and was generally interested in what was to come
Apr 6 2015,positive,not as bad as people make out
Apr 5 2015,positive,michelle  i have watched the movie im giving it a 5 star cause it keeps you on your toes curious whats next  how will it end    it was very cute when they first met  i would go for a man like him hes a true gentlemen and the rough part well hey arent relationships all about compromise it cant be that bad  wips i was saddened by the ending though i wish it had a happy ending
Apr 5 2015,positive,perfect acting perfect storyline very intimate scenes the ending was not the best
Apr 5 2015,positive,it scares me that women actually like these books  but saying that the movie was made well and both characters had good chemistry together  i wasnt surprised that they had to seriously tone down some of the more graphics scenes from the book to maintain a r rating
Apr 5 2015,positive,amazing love story with some very heart warming scenes
Apr 5 2015,negative,the movie completely lacks a logical chain of events for the plot simply skips to random moments from the book it takes escalating quickly to a whole other level moreover the significant situations that must lead up to the eventual romance between the main characters are under no circumstance performed with the appropriate emotion what stands out is the actors poor play and some bad camera positioning even though there were some funny scenes the movie is not worth devoting two hours to
Apr 5 2015,positive,not as bad as you may have been expecting
Apr 5 2015,positive,ive seen it 30 times review enough
Apr 5 2015,negative,style but no substance
Apr 5 2015,neutral,slightly more interesting than the american pie
Apr 5 2015,positive,not as good as i was hoping but still enjoyed it
Apr 4 2015,positive,the books i thought were horrible but i loved the movie cant wait to see if the second on
Apr 4 2015,negative,if i could give 0 stars i would the acting is lame the story is just too cheesy and slightly offensive to the intellect of this country and the sex scenes are lame lame lame lame
Apr 4 2015,negative,imagine a shit book which you have no real interest in has been turned into a shit screenplay before the movie house made a really stupid decision to go ahead and make the movie this is actually that batshit mental process made real    the best bit involves the helicopter sequence and that doesnt have any actual fucking in it
Apr 4 2015,positive,as a fan of the books i expected a lot from the film but knew it would not be as great as the books and i was right i did enjoy then film but found some parts very cringe and thought they clearly only worked in the book however the book lets face it is all about the sex and i feel they handled it very tastefully in the film except for the tie up bed scene the music was a bit to church miracle type event and it wasnt thats only my opinion though
Apr 4 2015,negative,so exciting i fell asleep  woke up at the uninspiring end the casting was terrible but the movie could have survived if the directing was better bdsm i have seen hotter scenes on lifetime
Apr 4 2015,negative,the plot is not engaging nor does it bring something interesting or new the characters are nearly emotionless in fact some scenes are so plain and boring that i came to the conclusion the pop corn was the main thing i was standing in front of the screen for even the sex scenes that were supposed to arouse or maybe shock are just simply boring and not out of this world i might even say this doesnt come close to sm maybe remotely close to bondage i would not recommend this movie unless you just want to see a tedious high budget softporn 25 on my behalf
Apr 3 2015,negative,easily one of the worst movies that ive ever seen the dialogue and pure reasoning of the characters especially anastasia are idiotic the fact that this piece of garbage has the balls to end on a cliffhanger blows my mind f this film
Apr 3 2015,neutral,this movie doesnt live up to the hype the characters are quite interesting but the sex is dreadful adding up to a very small duration of the entire movie the acting is pretty stiff too
Apr 3 2015,negative,should have gone for it along with embracing an nc17 rating would have made for a movie actually worth watching
Apr 3 2015,positive,miles ahead of its original source material 50 shades of grey is a beautiful mess mild for a bdsm movie but just spicy enough for middleaged women to enjoy shades is more of an romcom then anything else dakota johnson is a joy to watch owning this poorly written character and giving her an comedic edge
Apr 3 2015,negative,i found this movie a massive disappointment it was so hyped up and everyone was saying how great the books are and how amazing the movie would be i booked to see it with my boyfriend  i was extremely unimpressed the story line was quite frankly  stupid  i would hope that no one out there actually acts that way as its extremely embarrassing     i wouldnt recommend for anyone to go see this film the sex that everyone was raving about and that everyone was so excited to see  wasnt even there obviously they cant make it like a porno but it was extremely horrific the actors had no chemistry what so ever either
Apr 3 2015,positive,fifty shades of grey starts out slow but as the story builds it speeds up it follows the book pretty well
Apr 3 2015,positive,i felt like it wasnt worth the wait i was left wanting more
Apr 2 2015,positive,as much as dakota johnson and jamie dornan are impossibly attractive carrots teasing over your head like foreplay their acting here were painfully rehearsed until the bedroom actions kicked in to up the  chemistry adapted with glossy production values from the worldwide paperback phenomenon which was really a softporn excuse for women this guilty pleasure was intended as an intensely erotic fairy tale or dramatically fantasized depending on who you asked as the sex appeal of the two main leads balanced the almostmisogynistic theme of a superficial script fifty shades of grey was not all bad an appetizer to drum roll a cinematic trilogy it was merely fluffy stuff like a revenge television episode written by danielle steel
Apr 2 2015,negative,i wish i could give this a negative rating  that guy was a stalker enough said
Apr 2 2015,positive,hii really enjoyed this movie  it was much more then i expected i found it to be a movie about a very sweet girl who did have self respect and who fell in love  yes she did know what she was getting into somewhat and what she didnt she asked and made a decision on her terms  he in turn was also a very nice young man who had a fetish and he was up front with it he did not force it on anyone and he also fell in love with her and respected her wishes  the way it ended proves my point  i am not saying that this is the way it is for people with this fetish in real life this was a movie and i am talking only about this movie
Apr 2 2015,negative,more like 50 shades of caca what a waste of time and resources the half star is for ms johnson looks like she has some acting potential
Apr 2 2015,negative,fifty shades of foolishness nothing more needs to be said since i dont want to waste anymore time in this movie
Apr 1 2015,negative,is it just me or does this movie insinuate that bdsm stems from  childhood trauma
Apr 1 2015,negative,so hurtfully bad the subject although poorly represented in the book could be quite interesting to turn into a sultry passionate movie this is unfortunately far from such its definitely not good romance but also a poor thriller or erotic production the dialogue is so bad i had to cover my eyes from the start the shot of the main characters initial meeting  no sense no buildup no tension no complicity nothing its a pity such extensive advertising was wasted on this
Apr 1 2015,negative,not what i expected at all and the ending left me confused
Mar 31 2015,negative,what a waste of money horrible and stupid
Mar 31 2015,negative,fifty shades of nope
Mar 31 2015,negative,no chemistry between the leads and nothing interesting between the chains and whips 50 shades of grey is a boring mess of a movie thats sold only on its attractive leads
Mar 31 2015,negative,this movie is a joke do not waste your money on it  why  nothing interesting ever happens and when it happens all that is interesting is cut out ha ha hamust he have thought where is the plot  what is making is it so hot dont believe the hype  this superficial prank nice flat fancy cars which one is yours kinky come on man i knew it would be this way i feel put for fool  i would not doubt they dare to release mr grey will see you now again   make something new sam please
Mar 31 2015,negative,i did enjoy fifty shades of grey there i said it i also enjoyed the books a lot merely because of how horrible the prose was this is an enjoyably silly schmaltzy love story to start the year off with that fans of the book will love but nonfans will hate the love scenes are pretty sexy and dakota johnson is terrific as anastasia steele jamie dornan is a tad stiff but thats only because the script has nothing for him to do but stand around and brood with his shirt off    then again its a very silly movie so silly that i cant quite recommend you pay to see it in theaters theres practically no plot the entire movie is about anastasia deciding if she should become christian greys submissive or not every scene is him asking her have you made a decision yet and her responding no but soon come on give us a better story theres also the fact that the supporting actors all very good especially eloise mumford as anastasias roommate are completely underwritten    lets just hope that fifty shades darker which does have a better plot is a better movie
Mar 30 2015,positive,better than the book
Mar 30 2015,neutral,well the hype is not worth paying a movie ticket to see this flick which is true to the novel as far as narrative goes  nothing remarkable about it methinks
Mar 30 2015,negative,leave it    read the full review 
Mar 30 2015,positive,great acting loved the characters music soundtrack was amazing and it held my attention to the very end  appealed to my romantic side and showed a complex person and relationship that you end up rooting for  very well done and better than i expected
Mar 30 2015,positive,it was a good movie overall  i wish it was closer to the storyline of the book i hated the way it ended because well honestly i dont like suspense and being left hanging for a year  even if i have read the books although i wonder if the sequel will be better because of the new director one can only hope
Mar 30 2015,negative,it never actually gets anywhere
Mar 29 2015,neutral,didnt like the ending at all it was devastating
Mar 29 2015,negative,for some odd reason i couldnt formulate my thoughts about this movie days after i saw it but anyways ill give credit to the director and screenwriter in trying to craft an actual storyline than the book not a perfect one but the effort is there its also shot nicely but its still dragged down with wooden dialogue wooden acting and mediocre chemistry between the actors
Mar 29 2015,negative,friendly reminder a relationship is not a plot
Mar 29 2015,positive,it was what i expected
Mar 29 2015,positive,03152015 it was pretty good actually  enjoyed it
Mar 29 2015,neutral,i loved the book series and i think they did a good job making it into a film soft core porn instead of a told rated x porno but the actors in this film pretty much sucked except for mrssteel  i was disappointed with the casting but i love it because i love the book 
Mar 29 2015,negative,trash and a waste of film
Mar 29 2015,negative,if you want the definition of cheesy dialouge the films that will come up the twilight films adam sandlers whole filmography and pretty much any romantic comedy or bad melodrama this movie also belong in that specific group of films i went in to this movie thinking that there was going to be this kind of dialouge so it actually didnt bother me that much i also got to say i was kind of interested in the story halfway through the film but then it got really repetetive and nothing happened and character progress what is that actually the shooting of this film was not terrible at all but very well staged and executed and i didnt mind the soundtrack but rather enjoyed it however i cant look away from the terrible script even if it was better than the source material and the acting was not great either i feel that i cant blame the actors because no one would have made those characters interesting the film was destined to fail and so it did in my opinion even it had redeeming qualities
Mar 29 2015,negative,the idea that keeps tormenting the viewer is why does she settle for this abnormal taste guy why stick to this psychologically damaged rich boy she deserves a normal life i would not want my kids to watch this when they are older
Mar 28 2015,positive,i was impressed with this film the lead actress does a brilliant job just sad saw no penises   this film i feel was quite sexist because all you see is too much vagina and no penises   they tried to sell it as porn for females like we would get to see jamie naked but we didnt     
Mar 28 2015,negative,anna says she has seen more filth in the kays catalogue
Mar 28 2015,negative,laughably unerotic and jamie dorman is practically catatonic on screen but dakota johnson manages to maintain some dignity on screen with a sense of bemused astonishment
Mar 28 2015,positive,i liked they could have done better with the screenplay but i thought the acting was good and the characters believable
Mar 28 2015,positive,very good movie but then again i didnt read the books
Mar 27 2015,negative,one of the worst soft porns i have ever seen
Mar 27 2015,negative,a bland uninteresting tale that clearly reads nothing like the book
Mar 27 2015,negative,put plainly  50 shades is pretty damned bad  start to finish  bad concept  bad script  bad casting despite having never read the books  the best thing about the movie is being a producer  it cost about 40m to make and that investment was quadrupled in the first four days of its release    
Mar 27 2015,negative,i read the book and they cut out sections of at least 50 pages none of the transitions made sense also they painted this picture of christian being an abusive person who only seeks to hurt anna the book gives a better read on christian and shows him as a good person with an interesting personality trait i left the theater thoroughly upset
Mar 27 2015,negative,worst movie i was ever forced to see
Mar 26 2015,positive,i never thought i would cry watching this movie but i did i felt sad for the guy christian and for the girl anna i thought the movie was just going to be about sex but it was so much more having not read the book i now got the books to read 
Mar 26 2015,negative,the best part of the movie was good cars and his butt lol
Mar 26 2015,negative,weird that the movie ends with a broken heart
Mar 26 2015,positive,intensely great film rollercoaster of emotions truly enjoyed
Mar 26 2015,negative,when the nudity is so frequent as to make you look away that is a bad thing for a movie
Mar 26 2015,neutral,i might have been previously too harsh on the fifty shades film when i reviewed it before its still definitely not anything exciting to watch but compared to the book it actually is better    when making a film based on a terrible book series you already dont have much to work with especially when the books author constantly hounds harasses and pesters the director into giving her as much creative control as she can possibly have if it werent for e l james being a harpy on set this film actually might have had even more intelligence associated with it as it stands its already better than the novel of course a piece of shit cake is better than the novel but think of how much better it would be if the terrible author of the book wasnt affiliated with its production    there were i admit creative changes made in the script that never happen in the book that would have made the story poignant a word james doesnt understand and never can understand    i hated the fifty shades novel with every fiber of my being its romanticized abuse and the protagonist is highly unlikable in the film however she has a personality that her blank slate counterpart in the book doesnt she has a bit more fire and a bit more strength not too much but more its like the producers of the film knew that the book was terrible and wanted to turn it into something beautiful thats never easy to do and i have to admit that i feel sympathy for them when having to deal with the books author hounding them the entire time picking apart every little thing and demanding things be added or be removed or changed    im less fascinated with the film itself than i am with what the film could have been without e l james influence she needs to realize that there just are more creative people than her and to allow some breathing room her books are boring painfully boring but the movies have a chance to turn that possibility of saucy narcandsupply relationship into something engaging enthralling and fun    i know that james will remain glued to people on the next film as well i can only pray that they dont allow her to dog them around in the same manner christian proudly does in her awful books
Mar 26 2015,negative,this movie doesnt nothing for fans of book  doesnt tell how anna and mr grey find each other the how there relationship evolves we dont learn how why their relationship struggles and pleasure of ana sexuality
Mar 26 2015,negative,absolute car crash of a film dornan horribly cast
Mar 26 2015,negative,finally i saw the movie everyone was fussing about last month form begining to end despite giving credit to the soundtrack and the way the movie was shot yes the movie was visually beautiful i feel i just witnessed almost two hours of nothing this movie was pretty much a story that focused on a very bland and somewhat disfunctional relationship and no i dont think this gives bdsm a good image it makes it just come off as abuse which to me is a little hypocritical seen as the sales for kinky sex toys rose because of this franchise    the main characters i dont know who is worse the sadist which everyone sees as romantic for reasons i will never understand or bella 20 i know she has a name but seen as this was based off a twilight fanfiction i beleive it suits her who submits herself to things shes not into and then whines and complains that she wants romance you dumbass he said from the start hes not the romatic kind of guy so why are you even with him in the first place    there were two fliyng scenes who added nothin to the story they spent too much time talking about the stupid contract and the sex scenes even those were boring theyre porn for people who dont like to watch porn plain and simple and just when i was beginning to grow tired of watching two hours of nothing it ended to sum up the movie they meet the hook up theryre disfnctional and they break up there i just saved you two hours of your life     not my kind of movie no story to keep my attention and little to no chemestry between the leads im glad i didnt actually go to the theaters to go see this and i have a feeling i wont be bothered with the sequels
Mar 26 2015,positive,it was ok definitely not as good as it could have been the chemistry between the actors was lacking
Mar 25 2015,negative,horrible movie do not watch made me feel sick to my stomach totally depressing 
Mar 25 2015,positive,i really like this movie given i did not read the books from what i hear it is either the books or the movie
Mar 25 2015,positive,i liked it it was way better than the book and christian grey is hot
Mar 25 2015,positive,loved both book and film
Mar 24 2015,positive,if followed the book well but it seemed a little boring or slow at certain times looking forward to the sequel
Mar 24 2015,positive,followed the book well sex scenes were well done looking forward to the next one
Mar 24 2015,positive,it was stylish and cool disturbing at times anastasia was innocent but with a backbone and christian was fifty shades of fucked up
Mar 24 2015,negative,found the books better
Mar 23 2015,negative,smart marketing to bring it out on valentines day lets just hope you make the next one better this movie was like mrgrey said fifty shades of fked up
Mar 23 2015,positive,i have not read the book that the movie was based on and will not even try to read it how would you be sure of what time is it if you wear two watches on your arms how would a wife conquer her husband devotion if his attention is split between two woman how would you immerse yourself in the plot dialogue and sex scenes of this movie when your already create an abstract movie in your head the first time you read the book that this movie is based on i strongly believe that whoever saw this movie and was disappointed he or she had an emotional expectation born from the book sitting on the back of their minds waiting to be called again to your body senses while you were watching the big screen version of that book and suddenly were disappointed when did not happen again if you are expecting absolutely anything at the begning of the movie you will never be truly surprise or even into the movie itself due to that you will be constantly comparing and cross referencing what you read and what you are looking at i have never read that book but i loved the movie it was a beautiful picture and contains from my point of view a very attractive meaning behind all the sexual scenes
Mar 23 2015,negative,if there is a place in hell for people that make garbage films then that space just got larger
Mar 23 2015,negative,waited for something to happen it never did
Mar 23 2015,negative,just like the book everyone is stupid this shouldnt be a thing
Mar 23 2015,negative,just like the book everyone is stupid this shouldnt be a thing
Mar 23 2015,negative,if youre tossing up whether to see this movie dont    the female lead seems always close to tears and is infuriating and the male lead is a contemptible psychopath its hard to watch a movie where you hate both lead characters so much    you would think its tough to make a billionaire lifestyle and bdsm boring but mission accomplished    some people have said here that the movie is better than the film comments such as these shatter my faith in humanity
Mar 23 2015,negative,i personally think this movie is a horrible movie disrespectful towards women i would never again watch it or advise anyone to watch it its a silly storyline mr grey is a very rich man and thinks he can do what he like to people very disturbing to watch a few scenes especially the last scene very bad 
Mar 23 2015,negative,fifty shades of grey review by mike smith     literature student anastasia steeles life changes forever when she meets handsome yet tormented billionaire christian grey     when i write a review i try to find at least one good thing about every movie that being said fifty shades of grey had nothing to contribute to my cinematic love the cast is terrible dakota johnson and jamie dornan have no on screen chemistry they dont keep us interested in the film because they cant act at one point charlie hunnam was attached to play the main role of christian gray and after wasting a hour and fifty minutes on this abortion i really think he would have brought some acting to this train wreck the writing is crap and christian gray came off more like a stalker and a creeper anastasia steele seems like she is slow and dumb one thing that pisses me off about this movie is that if christian gray was just an average guy not a billionaire the tone of the movie would be completely different the music is just dark ominous tones or crappy covers of songs      and lets not forget the sex scenes there is nothing special about any of it so what you see her boobs not a big deal but the sex parts which is what the books are built upon are nothing to be excited about i should have just watched a real porno there would have been a better story and much better acting it makes me cringe knowing there are two more movies coming soon cheers and remember i watch the crappy movies so you dont have too     05 out of 10             edited by samantha locke
Mar 23 2015,negative,terrible bad cast worse acting no plot
Mar 22 2015,positive,i wasnt able to read the book but impressed with what i saw the lead stars delivered what is expected from them enjoyed the movie wish there was more intimate scenes 
Mar 22 2015,neutral,decent movie but more pg than i expected and ending was not great i get that there are 3 books but i havent read them and the ending could have been much better
Mar 22 2015,neutral,disappointing ive seen more risque things happened on basic cable
Mar 22 2015,negative,dont read the book dont see the movie  save you money
Mar 22 2015,negative,the book is awful the sequels even more so but thats unfair to say since i didnt finish them but seems to me the book could have been interesting if the author had two cents of imagination and actually had ever lived for just a minute in the bondage world  the movie is visually ok but the relationship even more feeble and almost vanilla its really of no interest whatsoever so tame and lame about two people in an uninteresting monotonous relationship going over the same details and conversations over and over in the movie as in the book it is hard to comprehend and unrealistic why christian would fall for regular dull and boring anastasia in the first place but the movie makes christian a wuss with little passion it doesnt help that there is zero chemistry between the actors a must in this scenario to sum it all up boring weak and not at all sexy
Mar 22 2015,negative,movie was gay as fack
Mar 22 2015,neutral,predictable storyline but just didnt have me gripped or whipped
Mar 22 2015,negative,this was pretty terrible i cant even bring myself to talk about why it just is what it is
Mar 22 2015,negative,unintentionally funny  about as erotically charged as a bowel movement and as subversive as your average episode of murder she wrote  this is a lightweight and pointless exercise for everyone concerned
Mar 22 2015,positive,it was solwbut some scene were better than others
Mar 22 2015,positive,wellc casted  better read the book first
Mar 22 2015,negative,the movie conveniently left out every bit of anastasias intelligence and forethought without that aspect the whole story becomesrapey no wonder everyone hates it
Mar 22 2015,negative,crap cant say what was worse book or movie
Mar 22 2015,positive,heard this is a great movie
Mar 22 2015,positive,i went in wanting to hate this movie and walked out begging for more the sexuality of the film is a foreign and decadent taste to the human sensesdesire lust and urnning for a adventure and adrenaline this movie redefines american sexuality in a way none of us would rather talk about but all secretly want a mustsee
Mar 21 2015,neutral,erotica is not my thing and thats where this film seems to wasnt too take you never read the books so maybe there is an end game here
Mar 21 2015,negative,didnt think it was possible but it was even worse than the book    terrible acting and dialogue and absolutely no flow
Mar 21 2015,negative,teen and bland lacks quality to be highlighted unworthy of further comment
Mar 21 2015,negative,it wouldnt let me rate 05 a piece of corn could have directed a better movie
Mar 21 2015,negative,what a waste of 2 hours this movie was horrible
Mar 21 2015,negative,rubbish and not even sexy
Mar 21 2015,negative,with such hype in the media i expected something big in the movie i was disappointed throughout the movie i kept waiting for the moment of the movie the point by which a movie makes its mark it could have come had it the movie not finished a bit earlier    or was it made so    dont watch it
Mar 21 2015,positive,i did it all backwards  never read the bookssaw the moviethen read the 2nd and 3rd bookthen read the 1st to compare to the movie call me crazy but i liked the movie when reading the books i could then put faces to the characters cant wait to see fifty shades darker curious as to how it will play out in the movie
Mar 21 2015,negative,major disappointment did not live up to the hype story and dialogue very infantile supposedly sexually exciting but only left me frustrated
Mar 21 2015,positive,i am glad that i saw the movie and i hope they make the other two books into a movie
Mar 21 2015,negative,bunch of cliches why is it even considered provoking
Mar 20 2015,positive,i loved the story line its a fictional portrayal of a forbidden way of life   everyone is intrigued because they hope it will answer their questions but their too scared or embarrassed to ask but we need to remember its a fictional storyline based on a series of fictional novels
Mar 20 2015,positive,this is a very seductive movie i love the characters chemistry it is about time to have this kind of movie openly exposed to mature audiences to see for those who judge this movie negatively does not have an ounce of sensual sense in himher
Mar 20 2015,positive,how can i watch the movie
Mar 20 2015,neutral,many ups and downs with this no pun intended i really like dakota johnson and the guy cast as christian isnt terriblejust the character is and the story     so to keep this shortthe book is pretty shoddy writing but whatever its about the story i guess even that is a bit weak with no character development etc translated to a movie i thought it effective for a while there was a buildup to the early sex scenes and with minimal weird stuff in those early scenes they were actually pretty hot later when christian really begins to lay down the law i began liking the movie and his character less and because she stuck with it anna     my complaints christians story is nonexistent to lame and the fact that hes a bit odd in the bedroom doesnt help the backstory and character is on the writers not the actor so he did well enough but the whole point of the movie seems to be this buildup to the masochistic sex when its barely there the scenes are effectively hot i just think the story unravels late when he becomes so unlikable its not worth continuing also i like some of the songs in the movie but the montage dates are pretty cheesy
Mar 20 2015,negative,aside from the obvious the way the movie ended felt hurried rushed but ay least this painful movie was finally over
Mar 20 2015,negative,i like some of the kinky scenes and johnson does a pretty good job with ana overall however dornan looks like hed rather be basically anywhere else throughout the majority of the film which doesnt seem like the best way to sell a dominant character in a case like this the typical omg we cant land an nc17 rating nudity double standards are irritating as well albeit not surprising and thats to say nothing of the inherent problems with the story itself
Mar 20 2015,negative,ugh shit soundtrack   not pushing it hard at all no edge at all played it safe  this after so many better erotic movies in past 30 years  two moon junction has this beat    weak
Mar 20 2015,neutral,my overall feeling after watching this is meh i did read the book and enjoyed that a bit but yeah im glad i didnt pay to see this
Mar 20 2015,positive,great movie i cant wait to see the others
Mar 20 2015,negative,cringe i thought the books were bad but this was so much more awkward than i could have ever imagined
Mar 19 2015,negative,i have seen ove 5000 movies in my life and i though that twilight was on the top 3 worse movies ever but this movie is the worseone ever it has no storyline it has no good actors no good camaras the movie suck if you watsh the movie with your partner  just look your partner reaction at the end of the movie and you will see what i am saying this something elese is that she was a verging and at some point of the movie she say that he can not try to change the way that she does thing in references to sex how could this be possible of she was a verging  wow pice of sh thanks good that i download ed for free on  i feel sorry for those how pay the movie ticket
Mar 19 2015,positive,you know what its about
Mar 19 2015,positive,i enjoyed the movie  im not sure what people were expecting but i thought it portrayed the story well without being too cheesy or expose to much this is a lifestyle that some people choose and i felt the story was well repented here
Mar 19 2015,positive,this was so much better than the book and the word of mouth was so bad thus lowering the bar even further that i sort of ended up loving it  knowing full well that it might be an average film  no cringe worthy inner godess dialogue no repetitive adjectives  mercurial  no wonder el james hated it so much  d
Mar 19 2015,positive,i have actually read the book and i hated it it felt incredibly unrealistic which might be the point but it kind of felt like the author thought that in order to write an erotic novel she has to make up a fictional character as screwed up and twisted as christian grey the book would have been a lot better and believable if it had been a romantic love story only sexier it can actually be romantic and erotic at the same time it doesnt have to be the one or the other because when the story is created the way that it is i dont really believe in the characters why would anastasia steele a 22yearold inexperienced literature student fall in love with a guy like christian grey  with that said i enjoyed the movie better than the book for some reason the storyline felt a slightly bit more plausible on screen although i still stand by my opinion that the character of christian grey isnt very credible   i was actually a bit afraid that they were going to romanticize this movie a bit too much i was happily surprised of how much they actually managed to show because seeing as the book has become an absolute sensation by now and most of the people who go to see the movie have probably read the book it wouldnt have worked to romanticize it and im happy that it managed to be so true to the book without it getting too much
Mar 19 2015,negative,one star for dakotas acting zero stars for the movie
Mar 19 2015,negative,boring and bland as hell  words that could describe the story cinematography actors etcthe leads lack chemistry and the whole thing feels clinical stiff dialogueand little plot development it would work if it was sobaditsfunny but instead its just plain bad you may be curious but believe me this movie is not worth exploring
Mar 19 2015,negative,a movie devoted to quotas without being aroused how pathetic
Mar 19 2015,negative,amazing stupid he beats her at the end of movie with a belt its so romantic i really hope young girls strive to meet a rich man and be sexually assaulted
Mar 19 2015,negative,worst film ever wouldnt bother watching it
Mar 19 2015,positive,i had to see this movie to see what all the hype was about my daughter and i went to see it on a weekday afternoon so the theater was empty except for us and a couple so i cant tell whether the audience appreciated it or not my daughter had read the books and let me know the writing was somewhat juvenile so not to expect too much from that area that advice turned out to be very good advice and i had to focus on suspending my disbelief to get down under the terrible writing and get to the meat of the story as it were i enjoyed this movie because of its unconventional story there are not a lot of movies out there strictly for adults these days the pg 13 rating has been given to a big portion of the industry to bring in the tween audiences and their money i was not convinced that jamie dornan was right for playing the part of grey but it turned out that he did a good job the chemistry could have been better between the two leading actors but i got the idea she was somewhat reluctant to get involved with the guy in the first place it was an enjoyable time spent in the theater i was entertained and that is what i pay for at the ticket booth
Mar 19 2015,positive,set the hype aside and no i did not read the bookgoing in with a clean slate i was moved in every way the story intended its a discomforting film to watch it was awkward at times and took you to a place that not everyone can directly relate to but why should you most will never experience that type of relationship however i saw a sensible depiction of what it might be like if i were it was a fresh diversion from the typical nicolas sparks algorithm thats been playing on repeat for the past decade and yes it did leave me wanting more    i did see jamie working through his accent at times which i believe caused him to force his character in certain moments nonetheless he is without a doubt christian grey
Mar 18 2015,negative,i feel horrible for the actors who now have to suffer the humility of  this film the books were tolerable the film       and the people who paid 12 a ticket to view this in theatre ouch
Mar 18 2015,positive,interesting but had expected more after reading books
Mar 18 2015,negative,the surprise is not that the movie is bad after all consider the source material im not talking about the novel by el james but twilight twilights characters were so shallow that there was absolutely nothing interesting about any of them the injection of sex into these characters only made them just a little more interesting but all it really did was change an emotionallypornographic story into a sensuallypornographic one as a matter of fact the sex scenes in the movie are the best part to watch because at least there was a sense of discovery on the party of anastasia that the audience could get to experience everything else in this movie and story is so banal that no amount of acting presence which isnt much can save it
Mar 18 2015,negative,while the film has its moments of unintentional hilarity impressive cinematography an enjoyable danny elfman score and the performances by the leads are decent but with its poor writing plot and characters fifty shades of grey is ultimately a dull uninteresting and unsatisfying bore
Mar 18 2015,negative,what a disaster of a film this guy could not even act his way out of a paper bag i have seen better acting on late night skinemax flix it was the exact same quality of acting you see in the kind of pornography that tries to be a movie but without the porn couldnt he have researched by watching the secretary his character seemed like a pathetic stalker like a needy weirdo like who has no command control or sexual appeal what so ever a total disaster how was he cast  any sadistic person knows would most likely never try and waste their time on an indecisive idiot like that the premise is silly never read the book but based on the film i never will plus it was so vanilla omg why dont you just get the fuzzy cuffs from victoria secret the director has no concept of sm where is the candle wax the needles the chains the chastity devices  instead we saw knots a boyscout could tie better and not one welt or mark on that girl that is not a sadist that is a stupid cheesy vanilla relationship where the girl completely ignores what the guy is into even though he completely explains it to her in advance she would rather just make him feel bad about himself and try to change him and heinstead of seeking a masochist or the many people who enjoy body modification or cutting or things of that nature he tries to change a virgin who shows no interest in actually submitting  stupid  horribly acting movie the guy who played her friend jose and only had like 3 lines was the most convincing actor in the film lol
Mar 18 2015,negative,i seriously felt so bad for the time i wasted watching this ridiculous movie i didnt like anything in this movie
Mar 18 2015,neutral,clearley its totaly bullshit even for a soft porn its all bullshit
Mar 18 2015,positive,actually watchable it wasnt as bad as people have made it out to sound it really depends on your maturity level it isnt a pornography people have been exaggerating the scenes wayy too much     i didnt like christian greys playroom and all that but its not like anastasia is cool with it she wants him to be normal but he is a freak  in a sexual way because of his sexual experiences as a child people keep saying   anastasia is some kind of whore wrong again she was actually a virgin     no im not going to say this is the best romance movie ive seen but it definitely wasnt the worst the cliffhanger at the end actually got me    call me another romantica girl all you want but im not i was never even into twilight and ive never even read the fifty shades books so give me a break people if you want to be immature and cause drama about something do it somewhere else
Mar 18 2015,positive,the perfect girls night out movie
Mar 18 2015,negative,twilight without the blood sucking vampire and the wolf pack
Mar 18 2015,positive,youll feel the same way about the movie as you did about the books i even got into the casting after awhile
Mar 17 2015,positive,it was a nice and tame version of the first book in the series im excited to see what the other two movies bring to the filmtable
Mar 17 2015,negative,even though i watched this drunk it was still somehow one of the most monumentally stupid and unfunny films ive ever seen but there was one awesome scene with a pencil
Mar 17 2015,negative,it was cheesy and i forgot if there was a storyi mean this is listed as romance so there has to be something romantic in this right all i saw was a couple who wanted different things a pushy dude who was a bit self centred and a girl who had low self esteempossibly didnt know what she wanted until the end  oh and a great lack of communication
Mar 17 2015,negative,misogynistic uninteresting stupidly plotted and most shocking enough as dull as a 50 year old brick 50 shades of grey is an amazing feat of ineptitude not just that its a piece of idiotic smut but that it doesnt even contain the hilarity of the original source materials poor literacy making this film not even an enjoyably terrible romp despite the best efforts of dakota johnson and the director of photography
Mar 17 2015,positive,i love it i has denying love torture humor and everything it should it was better than the book in this case she was more independent in the movie but in the book she was more like clingy if you know what i mean
Mar 17 2015,negative,if i could give it 0 i would
Mar 17 2015,negative,they completely changed important aspects of the book i understand they had to cut stuff out and cut stuff short it was a terrible remake of the book they could have done better there are quite a few people out there who ave read the books multiple time and know what they should expect out of the movie 2 thumbs down i didnt even watch the whole thing
Mar 17 2015,negative,half star for boobs i watched the movie and when the credits started rolling i said to myself thats it wheres the rest of the movie seriously the story is they meet they do it they try and define the relationship the dude whips her too hard the girl realizes the dude just wants to beat her really hard for pleasure fill in gaps between story progression with fluff so the movie lasts two long hours que credits
Mar 17 2015,negative,it is for the lack of a better word shit
Mar 17 2015,positive,fab books always better
Mar 17 2015,positive,done very well as far as book adaptation goes i was really looking forward to hearing the music for the film and was satisfied to hear it was appropriately intense lots of boob lots of sex but duh a bit awkward to watch this movie really pushes the limits of rrated
Mar 17 2015,positive,i went in expecting the worst of the worst to my surprise it wasnt as bad as what some reviewers and critics from social media have claimed it to be first off this movie is based of a poorly written book that is also based off of the twilight series which werent the best books ever written either understanding that its safe to say that this movie is better than novel imo the portrayal of christian gray was done above average we could see the character development from the beginning to and his increasing love and interest for ana as well depicting him as a billionaire was soot on from a lavish advertisement of apple and audi products and the inclusion of penthouses and rich boy attitude i thought jamie had done an excellent job now with dakota many critic her for playing a weak girl i say not reason is because shes much stronger than who she really is if you truly understand the story and mentality if ana you can feel what shes going through dakota played the perfect innocent delicious young woman which every rich man would lust for those lips and eyes her body the way she walks talks and connects with christian was pretty spot on dont think any other actress would have done differently all in all this movie is for people who are curious about bdsm and the whole idea of erotic film walk in with an open mind and you will be pleased
Mar 16 2015,negative,this wasnt the best movie i have ever seen but the book wasnt one of the best id read either  it was ok  better than i had expected based upon reviews  loved the casting for mr grey
Mar 16 2015,neutral,wayyyyy to many sex scenes and they seemed pointless the movie did a horrible job at living up to the book i prefer the book any day
Mar 16 2015,positive,enjoyed the movie and the characters  my only complaint would be that there was a lot of important content left out of the movie that was in the book  not enough time
Mar 16 2015,negative,sam taylorjohnsons film of el jamess twilight fan fictionturnedphenomenon is dreadful to be laughable nor so brilliant to be powerful  instead they get a sparky first third a rote obsessive love story anodyne kinkiness contentious sexual politics slivers of skillful filmmaking and a promising turn from dakota johnson daughter of actress melanie griffiths and actor don johnson  the setup is a simple one bookish anastasia steele johnson meets christian grey jamie dornan a business tycoon hiding a troubled past a lust for bdsm and a penchant for playing really miserable tunes on the piano he lavishes his wealth on her hoping shell sign a contract to become his submissive she yearns for a more typical movieandadinnertype relationship but tests her hard and soft limits anyway  as the emotions get more intense and we begin to learn the motivations underpinning greys need for dominance the film gets bogged down in repetitive earnest romantic drama  dornan as grey is no hero and johnson was so understated it was like she wasnt even there at all she gives anastasia both a strength and sense of humour
Mar 16 2015,negative,why just why there is very little this movie does right even the supposed sexual content is so underwhelming that i was playing sudoku on my tablet and having more fun from it than anything shown in the movie
Mar 16 2015,neutral,ok but not as good as everyone saidsoundtrack is great
Mar 16 2015,positive,i liked the movie until the last scene  the acting for the last scene  of the movie was flat  anticlimactic excuse the pun   the director should have re shot that scene  as expected the book gives more information than the movie  overall  it was an okay movie
Mar 16 2015,negative,i found this movie laughable
Mar 16 2015,negative,so the film version of el james fifty shades of grey sucks hard are you shocked i actually was shocked that fifty shades of grey on film is a such a dull bloodless affair thats about as erotic as prego porn sure the book sucked too but the book had real heat to it you knew you werent reading literary excellence james too had the common sense to suggest that there are actually real motives behind dominants and submissives    what we do have onscreen from slumming director sam taylorjohnson nowhere boy from a super sanitized script from kelly marcel is the story of poor virginal english major anastasia steel dakota johnson she finds the perfect man in 27yearold tech billionaire christian grey jamie dornan christians only flawhe gets off on blindfolding ana tying her up in his red room of pain and cuffing and flogging her got that    the movie presents a solution to the question of whats a girl to do and apparently the answer is do everything she can to domesticate the guy so hell charm her parents and theyll live happily ever after so whos being dominant now rather than dinner and a movie christian offers a contract that spells out everything from  how he wants to hold ana in bondage with sex toys like butt plugs and genital clamps but this being a consensual love story ana refuses anal and fisting its a hell of a negotiation christian makes things sweeter by dressing ana in high fashion getting her a computer hello product placement and supplying her a sports car taking her to the pacific northwest in his chopper where they go hanggliding and buying her first editions of thomas hardy novels the rough stuff hardly there    since the film is essentially trying to be an adult version of twilight that can still appeal to the young ones the rough sex is few and far between director taylorjohnson shoots all the crotch touching and nipple nuzzling like a strict school marm making sure not to let the kids have too much fun the wicked soundtrack from the likes of beyonce sia and ellie goulding make the sex scenes look more like old music videos theres no grit just gloss the movie shies away from real dirty details like bodily fluids and bruises save for a quick peek at christians junk as he spanks ana    fifty shades of grey is porn for tweens and a piss poor substitute for the books darker bloodier instincts the tampon scene is missing too bad it could have given the movie something it desperately needs real sparks and heat johnson the social network 21 jump street daughter of melanie griffith and don johnson no relation to the director either plays all of this swill for real shes the films one bright spot in a film that removes the joy of sex worse than the movie shame at least that was intentional johnson thankfully too gives ana muchneeded intelligence the book never hinted at dornan sadly is practically zombified the irish modelturnedactor hes amazing as a serial killer on the bbc series the fall seems to be too frightened or embarrassed or both to really give anything to the role this christian has no shades hes merely a human doll with nary a hint of the darkside and what drives him the better to not scare away the girls    critics who gave the film favorable reviews seemed grateful it wasnt as dirty and shocking as they thought itd be im way disappointed fifty shades of grey is horribly sanitized its most punishing feature is the crushing boredom it inspires
Mar 16 2015,positive,great movie but was hoping for more drama and a deeper storyline strong built characters but lack storyline
Mar 16 2015,positive,stayed true to the book loved it
Mar 16 2015,positive,totally loved it but it could have been a bit better
Mar 16 2015,negative,heres what i think this movie is a female fantasy and it is all from the womans point of view therefore the female character makes sense but the male character is all over the place his actions and motivations dont make any sense except as a foil for her the title suggests that the writer might even be somewhat aware of what shes doing  a character with 50 shades should be one with so many variations that he is inscrutable unfortunately rather than being multifaceted and mysterious mr grey comes off as a muddle of conflicting cliches   if the story could be taken seriously at all perhaps it is as a study of the contemporary womans fantasy of the ideal man according to this movie he is rich good looking young driven persistent superficially dangerous but soft on the inside ubersuccessful but not too bright and totally malleable to a woman who knows what she wants and is willing to stand up for herself  there really should be a scene at the end where she wakes up and realizes that she has fallen off a ladder at the hardware store and bumped her head
Mar 16 2015,negative,thats vanillai want my tickets back
Mar 15 2015,negative,bad book turned into a bad movie
Mar 15 2015,negative,rushed production led to a crappy film  just read the book
Mar 15 2015,negative,unsatisfying and boring and to point of being dry more like 50 shades of meh worst buildup to a sequel ever
Mar 15 2015,negative,i watched it because i read the books and i like to compare films to the original because there is no nice way to say it it was one of the worst decisions ive ever made it took two precious hours out of my life which can never be replaced dont waste your time or money
Mar 15 2015,positive,its pretty good the story line changes didnt bother me that much im okay with the nakedness but not a fan even tho i get why its there
Mar 15 2015,positive,7 meh kinda cool kinda weird and a lil long the guys voice got on my nerves the woman made the movie she was interesting cool music but i could have never seen this and missed nothing if any value never read the books
Mar 15 2015,negative,boring characters in a pointless plot it really is that bad although this does bring me little joy im hoping that this will be the worst film hollywood throws at us this year
Mar 15 2015,positive,without reading the book first i really enjoyed this film i found the chemistry between the lead actors very engaging throughout
Mar 15 2015,negative,definitely more hyped up than it should have been classic example of too much hype and not enough result
Mar 15 2015,positive,its good but not great i think the wed scenes were a little underwhelming
Mar 15 2015,negative,this was an absolute flop which was unfortunate due to the large fan base and hefty production budget afforded to it half a star goes to dakota johnsons performance as it made watching the film a little less painful
Mar 15 2015,negative,its even worse than the book and this is saying something the film is too shallow there is no sign of tension between the characters dont waste your time and money have a coffee instead
Mar 15 2015,negative,i read the book and loved it  this movie was the worst  such a disappointment  dont waste your money at the theaters or as a rental  itll be on tv soon enough  it is that bad  whoever did the casting should be shot  it was the lack of anything other than those 2 talking and a tad of sex here and there  theres so much more to the book  for example it never showed mrs robinson the woman who trained him at 15 or the encounters between mrs robinson and ana  what were they on a budget to make this film and wanted to pay for as few actorsactresses as they could  i cannot believe how bad it was  i read the reviews and anyone i asked said they didnt like it but i thought how bad can it be  well it is bad  really bad  and any critics reviews saying otherwise are getting paid to do so
Mar 15 2015,negative,i thought sex was supposed to be interesting
Mar 14 2015,positive,interesting movie looking forward to the sequel
Mar 14 2015,negative,i just want to leave give my 20 bucks backb
Mar 14 2015,positive,this is a wonderful movie for anyone studying psychology admittedly i had no interest in reading the book or joining in on the hype surrounding it it is my opinion that this movie truly explores the character of mr grey and not his counterpart ana although anas life is more fully explored in the movie and her character is the one audiences are lead to be able to relate with i do not believe she is as important as mr grey   a boy neglected by a drug addicted mother adopted by a wealthy family that also neglects him sexually abused by a family friend and ultimately the circle of abuse continues as he himself becomes the abuser this is a story about a man that begins to overcome the emotional obstacles that his past has caused and the woman he idolizes for her innocence   true love is the ability to accept someone regardless of their flaws i have been in many relationships in which i have made compromises for the one i loved i am in no way condoning abuse there is a distinction between abuse and sadism which ana was unable to comprehend   ultimately to truly understand this movie you must look beyond the surface as is true with everything in life
Mar 14 2015,negative,i dont think i will want watch the characters seem so dull in  the trailer and it bored me i read the first book to see what all the hype was about i regret reading it i will not read the rest it was poorly written i cant believe our society today how could you promote this book to the big screen as it is basically about an abusive relationship grid taking advantage of this poor girl im glad the movie was banned in certain countries
Mar 14 2015,positive,where do i begin  well it wasnt terrible i took a star off because the lines felt very rushed as they were speaking it was like they spoke fast to squeeze in the good lines a lot of the scenes happened in a flash i stepped out for literally one whole minute and about the equivalent of 6 chapters went by in the movie while i was out  just like any other movie based off of a novel a lot of scenes were cut out christian greys hair is not the color they describe in the book  and last but not least the movie ended way before the book did it was missing about 15 of what the book gave us so overall it was only a 3 star movie but a 4 star disappointment
Mar 14 2015,negative,even the actors hate this movie
Mar 14 2015,positive,i loved this movie i read all of the books years ago and after opening weekend i was disappointed to hear all the terrible reviews when i went to see it i was expecting a horrible movie but thats not what i got it was so awesome that i even went to see it again if you hadnt seen it then go asap it is worth it
Mar 14 2015,negative,horrible  what a waste of money  this movie is so rushed and just gives the impression that christian is a controlling psycho and anastasia has very low self esteem so she gives in to his fantasies  why did they bother casting anyone else for the other roles if they only had one scene each  practically at the dinner table  save your money and go watch something worth while
Mar 14 2015,negative,worst movie i have seen in a long time do not waste your time watching this
Mar 14 2015,positive,enjoyed it because i love romantic movies girls like me who loves notebook kind of movies can enjoy this one too
Mar 14 2015,negative,i thought this movie was fifty shades of shit bad acting poor represntations of the book and its charactors not sexy at all i was bored and in ways humored by the films attempt that i actually laughed at sceens that were not meant to be funny utter traggity please dont make more i would suggest just remaking it i think that hbo or starz might do it more justice as a serise spatucus for example had some spectacular sex sceens
Mar 14 2015,positive,overall wasnt bad was very close to the books obviously left out some things i wish they hadnt but i liked it the acting wasnt horrible pretty much what i thought it would be cant wait for the next one
Mar 14 2015,positive,movie was ok love story probably need to read the books to appreciate the story more
Mar 14 2015,negative,2 stars wow 2 stars more than i thought id be rating this   the 2 stars are for dakota she makes this watchable and manages to give ana a bit more character and pluck than she had in the book also the movie is filmed nicely and well paced   however the saying goes you cant polish a turd and the source material is one big steaming one   it is beyond disturbing to me that this is considered erotic by do many women its not its fed   said it before ill say it again this is domestic violence you cant change a guy like this its not hot hes not a challenge it bothers me that this is out there in a way   i will probably not watch part two for the same reason i didnt read part two i dont want to see her go back to him her leaving his twisted ass works for me
Mar 14 2015,negative,having hyped the book as a literary version of redtube i watched it like every other guy  for a tit here an ass there or a bdsm moment which honestly never pays off the fact that i was laughing at the dialogues that was supposed to be seductive was enough to know how bad it was and getting to a pointless conclusion just like all the preceding events in this movie was worth a whole lot of nothing dakota is pretty grey has a stupid accent and the film is trash
Mar 14 2015,negative,i was very disappointed in the movie it ruined the memory of the book for me
Mar 14 2015,negative,a lame attempt at soft core porn degrading to woman
Mar 13 2015,negative,literally walked out of the theatre i never so that
Mar 13 2015,negative,terribly unsafe kink practices youd think after consulting someone to put that room together they would have someone around to let them know how to tie a proper knot    consent is out the window when steele doesnt even know anything she has just agreed to be a part of they very clearly want different types of relationships and if he wasnt a billionaire she would be calling the cops
Mar 13 2015,positive,its a set trilogy most viewers and critics prove to possess thrilling hot sex behaviour anna desires to be flogged  look at her shes never been hurt so good and she still bites her lip i heard the next instalment should crush your will
Mar 13 2015,positive,it was a very entertaining movie
Mar 13 2015,positive,not as bad as people made it out to be sorry not sorry
Mar 13 2015,negative,the mixture of eroticism and romance that presents the novel were lost during the adaptation of the script and is sad beacuse the idea was smart the only good fact of this ridiculous movie is the soundtrack and is not even brilliant
Mar 13 2015,neutral,this film had a lot riding on its success and while it was a financially successful film the film itself is a bit of a mixed bag first of all you need to know that it seemed that everyone tried their best to make the best film they possibly could from the great performance from lead dakota johnson to the great directing by sam taylor johnson and even the amazing soundtrack the film was firing on all cylindersuntil it came across the screenplay the majority of the dialogue in this movie is so laughably bad it makes the film border on a guilty pleasure or semi comedy granted with the material the filmmakers had to go on they did their best actor jamie dornan didnt seem to comfortable with his lines which made his performance seem fairly wooden and dull that also contributed to the fact that the leads share a minimal amount of chemistry all in all the film missed the opportunity to make a serious drama and instead landed on a sillier version of 9 12 weeks if you go into this film with minimal expectations and dont take it seriously you might be pleased c
Mar 13 2015,negative,quite possibly one of the worst movies i have ever seen the story is pathetic and the way its carried out in the movie its so terrible there is zero chemistry between the two with terrible acting and the lead mr grey having as much charm as my toe nail
Mar 13 2015,positive,i have read all three books and i think the movie was beautifully executed   i wanted to see more of the story build up from the book as it would have added that missing context but the movie was enjoyable nonetheless
Mar 13 2015,positive,i loved the movie personally and can not wait to seethe next one
Mar 13 2015,positive,loved it   cant wait for the next oneï¼
Mar 13 2015,negative,one of the most uncomfortable experiences of my life
Mar 13 2015,positive,i personally did not find it distasteful or bad but it could have been better in some ways i have read this book and actually do not feel they did a terrible job representing the book of course things are different but i do not feel they did bad
Mar 13 2015,positive,this movie is a gift from the universe  having not read the book and also being a complete prude this movie did not even remotely offend me and wasnt dirty at all      jamie dornan looks like a cross between colin firth and my husband if they did weights yearround so i am perfectly delighted to watch him with his shirt off  i even wanted to send him a thank you note  ha    now it was not supposed to be a comedy but the theater on the day i went was roaring with laughter almost from beginning to end  everyone left happy  and like i said both actors are beautiful why is that so hard these days     highly recommend      secret santa is buying this dvd for friends this year for sure
Mar 13 2015,negative,so boring definitely not what i expected compared to reading the book
Mar 13 2015,positive,dont understand all the negativity its a romance movie with a bit of dirt in it that sort of movies is my cup of tea hence i went to see it  if youre not into that type of thing go see something else loved it
Mar 13 2015,positive,awsome  great movie recommended to see  i really hope they make a second one
Mar 13 2015,positive,i went in with no expectation i also havent read the books i wouldnt say its the best movie around but i was definitely entertained and i will definitely see the next instalment the movie is so much more then just the bdsm hype thats following it
Mar 13 2015,negative,the film that has to date grossed over 500 million and has resulted in cinemas been force to place caution wet floor signs on their aisles sam taylorjohnsons film is like one of those high school teen flicks where the ugly duckling becomes the prom queen to begin with she dakota johnson is an extremely beautiful lady who gives a major twitch when she gets the bangers out they just throw some conservative clothes on her and make her a stereotypical book worm spoiler warning grey on the other hand with all his demons is just a rich cunt who isnt really into sm he has this play room that would freak out fred and rose west and turn josef fritzel stomach so many gadgets and toys he must have an army of chinese factory workers manufacturing them in his basement anyway when his submissive agreed to let him do his worst on her i am expecting him to suspend her to the ceiling in a bungee elastic chord or a showcase of his anal speculums rubber fisting mittens and stuffoscopes finshed off with a grand finale of auto erotic mummification instead we learn that his major vice is just whipping her six times with his belt that is just like dating a girl who has a state of the art home cinema in her house complete with theatre seating pop corn making machine confectionary stall beverage fountains and an extensive just for show 35mm film collection but at the end of the day when he sits down to watch a few movies she generally digs out his tyler perrys back catalogue
Mar 13 2015,positive,the first time i have ever experienced kinky romance on screen this romance with a twist kept me interested and wondering how it would end a masterful performance from dornan now for the sequel d
Mar 13 2015,positive,great movie cant wait for the 2nd partâtmâtmâtmâtm
Mar 13 2015,negative,a story about a man who has everything materialistically and contains nothing emotionally the film is devoid of any real story and acting despite its absence of any substance the sexual tension of the two main characters is a bit alluring but that quickly diminishes twothirds through the movie christian grey is a stalking predator acting on base animal instincts while trying to overpower  subvert a naive  curious anastasia steele both mentally  physically  to mold her into his submissive nonthinking piece of meat the ending of the film is even more disappointing i watched this film purely out of curiosity of its popularity but its utterly disappointing and lackluster perhaps the book is better no clue
Mar 12 2015,negative,very poor acting by both main characters i just did not feel the heat between the two and there was a lot that was not explained if you had not read the books  also someone please chop off her freaking lips i swear if i have to see them zoom in on her lips one more time i am going to scream   dakota was also way too skinny flat chested and really hairy what is with all that body hair ick
Mar 12 2015,positive,this is my favorite movie of the year so far reminded me of pretty woman you start to care for the characters look forward to future movies
Mar 12 2015,positive,not bad movie at all
Mar 12 2015,negative,who did the casting  c mon
Mar 12 2015,positive,why the hell did so many people give this a bad rating  the movie is hot and i love the cast  bring on movie 2
Mar 12 2015,positive,a mind boggling movie about a guy who has so much money but has crazy rules and hobbies that he will probably die byi love itlol
Mar 12 2015,positive,very good film it was a lot different from the book but in a good way it really kept the viewer engaged and was kind of playful at many times during the movie ana in the start was very cautious about christians behavior but never really showed any signs of being scared which also kept the viewer wanting to see more and where it would go it definitely displays a lot of sexual scenes but i think it works very well for it it displayed exploration of sex and curiosity of what a submissive is for ana who hasnt been with anyone before it is almost healthy for her to be this person where she is taken into control by christian in fifty shades of grey
Mar 12 2015,neutral,meh chemistry doesnt really seem there between the two leads perhaps over hyped some scenes a little kinky but mostly geared towards the in the closet nympho soccer moms out there
Mar 12 2015,positive,i dont understand why the rating is so low its exactly what happened in the book i guess for the readers like me our expectation is reasonably low so we didnt experience the shock of how ridiculous their relationship can be
Mar 12 2015,positive,if you consider that this is dramaromance and not a porn this is very decent movie
Mar 12 2015,positive,was all and all a good movie i will admit the book was ten times better but the actors portrayed the characters really well especially the character of christian grey
Mar 12 2015,negative,was this book and movie wrote in 11 year olds unrealistic sex fantasy
Mar 12 2015,positive,thought it was good seems like thomas crown affair with focus on sex instead of art and i guess i dont understand the ending
Mar 12 2015,positive,it like the fairy tale
Mar 12 2015,positive,i had pretty low expectations of this movie but was pleasantly surprised
Mar 12 2015,negative,i went into this movie with very very low expectations  but  this is not a movie for men  i am imagining that is why there is such a horrible rating  i dont blame it though look at mine  for the first half of the movie the actors were struggling with the horribly badly written twilight fan fiction script  i wasnt going to mention that but it feel like thats exactly what you are watching  great      the thing that bothers me the most it makes no sense at all  this would never happen in real life at all  she wouldnt be a virgin she wouldnt let herself get carried away like that she wouldnt be biting her lip that much if she was a virgin just a lot of crap piled on top of itself    i did go see this with a bunch of women which is the way to do it trust me  we had a blast  dont bring your man thinking hell clue in to what you want in bed    oh and nothing actually happens in this movie the most hard thing that happens is some ass whipping  not that hard at all  and he claims to be a sadist pfft
Mar 12 2015,negative,completely soft cock for a sex movie
Mar 12 2015,negative,dreadfully boring film which has no depth to the characters or story  any normal woman would only get involved with christian simply because hes rich  the powerful bit doesnt make it to the screen  theres nothing remotely interesting about him  innocent virgins do not behave like that  the film is less than b movie  its shear trash
Mar 11 2015,negative,not sexy or romantic   just a creepy dude chasing after a girl for an hour and 50 minutes  also has really bad editing and very obvious jump cuts
Mar 11 2015,negative,dakota johnson is so ugly to look at i can see why jamie dornan looks so uncomfortable kissing her i hope they cast someone else for anastasia steele she seriously needs an acting coach n dental work
Mar 11 2015,positive,i loved it  it brought the book alive  i felt all the emotions they felt  im looking forward to part 2
Mar 11 2015,positive,girlfriend loved it took her as valentines surprise
Mar 11 2015,negative,i give it half because the female actress was decent  i say decent acting was below average
Mar 11 2015,negative,what a piece of crap just like the book we should burn the books along with all the copies of the movie i did not pay to this movie got a copy from a friend theres no way a would pay to see this sht
Mar 11 2015,negative,dornan works overtime to make grey an interesting character but he doesnt really succeed and neither does anyone or anything else really
Mar 11 2015,positive,it wasnt the best movie ive ever seen but it wasnt terrible artistically it was pretty cool
Mar 11 2015,negative,not all that great  after hearing about it for months i thought it would be all that  dont waist your money  wait for it to come out on dvd
Mar 11 2015,negative,fifty shades of grey is that rare experience that leaves you angry as it has insulted my intelligence and my attention  i dont even know where to begin  the cast try their hardest to make it past a worthless script and laughibly awful dialogue  its involves anastatia steele a young woman who interviews billionare christian grey  the two become quickly attracted to each other and she is pulled into his lavish world but she soon discovers he has a dark secret  dakota johnson plays anastatia and jamie dornan plays christian  these two have little to no chemsitry on screen with johnson feeling like a young child against dornans creepy and completely serious performance  a little humor could have done the characters some good since the complete lack of any fun between them made their romance as boring as it comes  this is a film that was made strictly because of the success of the book which most would agree is porn for soccer moms  it was not a well recieved book so i never imagined the film would be any better but i gave it the benefit of the doubt nonetheless  but this erotic twilight ripoff simply doesnt do anything interesting for nearly two hours and gives us a joyless and strange romance with actors with absolutely no chemistry  to call this film an expensive porno would be accurate as the story here is about as intersting as a porno  fifty shades of grey will certainly become a series but it will clearly be made out of greed and not quality
Mar 11 2015,positive,i loved this movie it goes exactly along with the books which is amazing if your looking for a intense love story this is for you i was on edge the whole time
Mar 11 2015,negative,dakota johnson is the best thing about this movie and thats about it
Mar 11 2015,positive,a very seductive sexy movie
Mar 11 2015,negative,was a very bad movie and not worth your money
Mar 11 2015,positive,better than expected
Mar 11 2015,negative,terrible terrible acting but very sensual movie goes right along with the book the actors make a great anastasia and christian ready for next one
Mar 10 2015,positive,better than i expected
Mar 10 2015,negative,way to much bushnasty she needs to shave
Mar 10 2015,positive,much better than i expected which is why i gave it 4 stars they should have cast someone for the role of grey who is a little more handsome and built in my opinion
Mar 10 2015,negative,perfectly boring movie with sufferable plot
Mar 10 2015,negative,micheal bays transformers movies are better period
Mar 10 2015,negative,ummm this is soft core porn theres no chemistry between the actors and im not invested in their story could care less if theyre together but porn is new in the mainstream market so i give it two stars
Mar 10 2015,negative,just god awful acting and direction the only actoractress that i thought was even partially believable was eloise mumford as kate kavanagh i do believe that dakota johnson was a great choice for anastasia but her acting was just horrible  thought i was watching a high school production  i hope this is sam taylorjohnson last film afterall i am blown away at how bad she destroyed such a nobrainer blockbuster  how the hell did she get hired for this movie
Mar 10 2015,positive,could have been better
Mar 10 2015,negative,fifty shades of shite ive seen amateur porn with more imagination the intimate scenes were awkward and so badly acted that i felt like i was watching my unattractive pensioner neighbours have sex there was no emotional connect and lets face it if he wasnt rich he would probably in prison sharing a cell with the boston strangler in short a bad film based on porn written by a grandmother 
Mar 10 2015,negative,45  saw this on 10315  while cinematography is an asset and the acting is good enough 50 shades of grey is not that erotic for people trying to look away from porn and watch something of the sort from films then you will be disappointed with 50 shades i have never read the book and if i were to believe the critics then i wonder how awful this book would really be this film is also extremely silly at times and tries to be more and more like your average romantic film it doesnt quite effectively portray the submissive sex as it all seems rather too simple
Mar 10 2015,positive,get out of the closet its an exciting entertaining movie
Mar 10 2015,negative,stupid everyone going on about this n there is nothing good about it its disturbing sick  sadistic
Mar 10 2015,negative,there are only 2 things that made me finish this movie one  dakota two  the soundtrack
Mar 10 2015,negative,left out the plot to make room for the pornshouldve cast charlie hunnam hed definitely be able to pull off a christian graywe actually laughed half the movie due to the cheesy acting
Mar 10 2015,positive,basically a rich guy who likes to play with woman then someone tries to break in to his hart he just flees and refuses to change of course his childhood was not good but if you find someone like ana well to me this film was not that great as everybody was saying one time film to see
Mar 10 2015,negative,the acting was horrible and dry  the whole story line was ridiculous and boring  you are better off watching porn if you are expecting to get turned on  and i suggest a disney movie instead of this if you expect romance ill pass on the sequel
Mar 9 2015,negative,i want my two hours back
Mar 9 2015,negative,well this was awful let me start by saying i did not read the book so take that as it is the hardcore book readers will defend this movie til theyre blue in the face but in all reality the film was garbage its not a film for the conservative crowd thats for sure the direction to the film was all over the place not that it was tough to follow but it never really led into anything just terrible as far as the bondage  sex scenes go they really werent that intense obviously more active than most erotic movies but it truly wasnt as bad as i was expecting mostly soft core porn gone wrong i sincerely hope women dont believe this is a love story its exactly whats wrong with society to be honest the only reason im even being nice and rating the film a solid 1 star is because the movie was so bad it was mildly entertaining
Mar 9 2015,neutral,fifty shades of i cant believe i watched this twice i read the trilogy  not because im into the romance genre im a love of the classics and yes ive actually read tess of the durbervilles but because a ridiculous number of my married and single lady friends read them and well curiosity got the better of me we all know how terribly el james writes and the subject matter leaves a lot to be desired plus weve pretty much heard enough criticism about the unrealistic nature of the christiananastasia bdsm relationship we dont need to rehash the domestic violence discussions     lets talk about some of the merits of the movie    so we have one young woman about to graduate from college who finds herself reluctantly interviewing the worlds most eligible bachelor under thirty hes smitten almost immediately and shes intrigued but intimidated the deadly hot billionaire decides to engage in what could easily be defined as moderately stalkerish behavior meant to entice the young woman into a dominantsubmissive relationship guy engages in some fairly elaborate stunts to get girls attention including showering her with gifts even though he claims adamantly that hes not the hearts and flowers kind of guy no instead he sends first editions of thomas hardy novels a new apple laptop and an audi coupe we should all be so lucky and though this guy wants to be in control dominating every part of the girls life it becomes very clear by the end that this isnt the case at all she finally decides she cant take the red room his need to punish her or his inability to give her more so she bolts and leaves him completely bewildered    lets talk anastasia and christian from a young adult perspective its hard to give yourself completely to someone else when youre not entirely sure who you are and have little life experience to rely upon christian has not exactly had the most traditional of upbringings in the first novelmovie we know he was adopted by the very wealthy and successful greys that his biological mother was probably on child protective services frequent flier and that he lost his virginity to one of his mothers friends at the age of fifteen hes lived a full life at the age of 27 and is hesitant to let anyone really know him or touch him anastasia is completely different she meets christian and he believes somewhat mistakenly that she would be the perfect submissive based on his first impression ana is anything but submissive     its a welcome change in the screen adaptation typically screen adaptations pale in comparison to their literary counterparts with a few notable exceptions this is the first time ive read a book and been more pleased with the movie kelly marcel omits a lot of anas tiresome inner monologue and indecisiveness in favor of a slightly more assertive and concerned female character unlike the book ana asks a lot of christian and finds a way to pull him out of his comfort zone and into hers for a person who professes to exude control in all matters christian loses himself fairly quickly in his pursuit of ana what we end up seeing is a power struggle between two truly dominant people looking for the right opportunity to submit to someone christian speaks often of trust and comfort in submission he ultimately has to trust her as much as she has to trust him in order for their relationship to continue     the biggest point of controversy is christians treatment of anastasia he is constantly aware of her location inserts himself into her life in overbearing and creepy ways and tries to direct her life fortunately for everyone anastasia is relatively astute and keeps a sense of humor and propriety about the situation often poking fun at christian for his behavior there are points where being sexually adventurous borders on overtly sadistic actions that make us uncomfortable particularly towards the end ana questions this too even going as far as to ask why do you want to punish me she asks in a way that most of us vanilla types are asking too what is it that drives people to bdsm where christian is concerned we dont get the answers until later in the trilogy but were also wondering why exactly he is so obsessed with ana is it love when she admits her feelings for him christian acts completely astonished that anyone could be in love with him given his sexual perversions and generally screwed up mental state honestly being in love in your early twenties is a lot like that  two complete head cases coming together to make some sort of sense in the world honestly who are we really to judge theres something to be said for romanticizing these kinds of relationships that border on abuse but you really could cite how frequently they exist in films and literature  tess of the durbervilles is a fantastic example besides the erotic mommy porn reputation the novel and film have garnered maybe people actually relate in some way to the material its not just escapism but something else     other points there was a startling lack of development of the other central characters from the novel in a trilogy you have a little more time to waste i suppose the chemistry between jamie dornan and dakota johnson is initially shaky but works itself out a bit by the end sam taylorjohnson actually did a really fantastic job of directing a film that arguably had a lot of high expectations from the outset its unfortunate she wont be around for the sequels the sex scenes were in my opinion relatively tasteful and not exploitative i saw more of dakota johnson than i needed to although jamie dornan did look fantastic in those infamous distressed jeans oy     bottom line i saw it with girlfriends in the theater the first time and watched in on bluray alone the second time i was entertained and sometimes thats whats really important
Mar 9 2015,negative,meh a pity cause it couldve been better but ended up being boring and dragged for so long
Mar 9 2015,positive,just not as much as i would like ending is very poor
Mar 9 2015,positive,it was a really good movie very sexual but good i wasnt expecting so much sex but the plot was intriguing and i really liked it
Mar 9 2015,negative,horrible  one of the worst ive ever seen  couldnt wait for it to be over  sappy romantic crap
Mar 9 2015,positive,a lot of sex not enough story
Mar 9 2015,positive,i think they missed things in the book
Mar 9 2015,positive,great passion seemed a bit predictable to me as she was a virgin and he a sexual deviant worst ending in romance
Mar 9 2015,negative,omg fifty shads id the worst movie everrrr i wouldve asked for my money back    no point what so ever waste of 2 hrs of my life
Mar 9 2015,positive,worst movie ever i did not like it one little bit apart from a bit of titillation i was stuck in a cinema with the wife and a gaggle of 40 to 50 year olds that constantly got up to go to the toilet why 5 stars this is the most effective movie ever if you want to spice up your sex life no idea why it works but it just does men are from mars take your wife  girlfriend to this movie it is much cheaper than an expensive dinner that probably wont work anyway actually the movie was quite watchable but i did not really get it until later that night 
Mar 9 2015,positive,though it was good and true to the book if you are expecting porn then you will be disappointed we enjoyed it
Mar 9 2015,neutral,stick and stones  fiendishly sexy but not quite my tempo i am writing this review knowing i will lose a lot of movie or man credit but here it is i jumped on the original band wagon for the first twilight film the first one still have and may not ever watch the last ones it was bad but i rather enjoyed it and fell for kristen stewart i stated that so any middle aged mothers or tweens may know if this film was good there is no bias hate because it was written by a woman or is aimed at a disliked target market with that said it was not a great or even good film it was fairly interesting and surprisingly not bad as i thought both in the film and sexual content it was a little bad not terrible but not alright either  anesthesia steele played very well by dakota johnson anesthesia is the name of one of the wicked stepsisters in cinderella interviews a young tycoon business dude christian grey james bond  mark zuckerberg they start to fall into sappydappy love with whips and chains but grey has a little tug and pull problem when it comes to sex he is into bdsm like way into that shit like he knows every aspect of its invention the whole film is the twos love affair that struggles to stay alive with the only way to consulate into love making is in a strictly dominating role    the secretary i am afraid takes away any glory this could of had if any from the high criticized book and writer e l james calling it badly written sexfiendish filth i cant write to save my life so im not gonna kick dirt at the book i have only heard from a audio book that thankfully i did not finish after watching this because it would of been a complete waste of time this may keep you involved with fairly good performances from both dakota johnson and jamie dornan in a really bad story      honestly the credited star rating i give this film goes to those two dedicated roles and the cinematographers pin point theme he brought to the screen  a film that seemed to be plagiarized by e l james that has a better tolled tale and ended story i would rather watch instead in a heart beat is the secretary with the talented maggie gyllenhaal and i got to say with the pervert in me it has better exotic sexual scenes then this film holds your the better part of you attention with a little bad film that surprisingly did not bore me but it does have a lot of nudity that may be why stellar performances that define any good parts of the film if any i definitely see a sequel with that preemptive ending that probably will just be an even more of a cash grab for the filmmakers then actually telling a better story with the book rights
Mar 9 2015,negative,gosh this was terrible  yes i have read the books and i have to admit that the last book was very hard for me to get throughi wanted to smack anna but i digress this should be about this movie  the two main characters had no chemistryat all  the sex scenes were just blahif i wanted to see a naked woman i could just look in the mirror  dag gone it why are men so shy ok that is probably just actors namely famous ones  heck i didnt even want the full tamale but even a side view a la ben affleck in gone girl would be better than nothing  this should be a film for women and it just showed anna naked a lot and the just flashed greys butt  what the heck i glad i didnt have to pay for this tripe but i felt bad my friend paid for thisguess ill have to treat to age of ultron
Mar 9 2015,negative,the room with bdsm
Mar 9 2015,positive,i didnt know anything about the books before seeing this i get the impression that the book was terribly written and the movie makers know this out of this story they make a pretty passable movie     the key ingredient is dakota johnson she is a very sexy woman and the character she is portraying comes across very clearly her body is fantastic and she goes all in for this role quite titillatiing
Mar 8 2015,negative,after reading so many scathing attacks on this movie and a friend even walking out halfway through curiosity go the better of me as long as it didnt cost me and i could jump trough the sex scenes i flinch at any kind of pain i wanted to see what all the fuss was about    how i regret that decision a day later and im still feeling disturbed honestly that was one of the worst movies ive ever seen in my life  and anyone who gets a kick out of it really should start therapy asap    sick sick sick any man like that should be institutionalized immediately
Mar 8 2015,negative,seen in master pancake context so thankfully couldnt hear most of the dialogue
Mar 8 2015,positive,great new age romance story
Mar 8 2015,positive,love the sexuality and passion of this movie i cant wait untill part2
Mar 8 2015,positive,ok so i havent read the book but honestly this movie was better than expected
Mar 8 2015,positive,its not as bad as some critics said a lot of scenes were shot in van look forward to the sequel 
Mar 8 2015,negative,the chemistry between ana and christian just wasnt there
Mar 8 2015,positive,best movie ever i love it  they better make the second one
Mar 8 2015,negative,horrible no tension no chemistry
Mar 8 2015,positive,what can i say i actually liked this movie
Mar 8 2015,positive,surprisingly enjoyable movie could follow along very well for not reading the books previously we written screen play and good chemistry on screen between main characters thought the sex tool away from the movie rather than adding to it
Mar 8 2015,negative,and i thought the books were bad an extra star for having jamie dornan
Mar 8 2015,negative,nauseating and painful to watch
Mar 8 2015,negative,how awkward can it be watching a porn with other a bunch of other people
Mar 8 2015,negative,terrible chemistry awkward dialogue just awful
Mar 8 2015,negative,a salacious mess of a movie that all things considered is actually pretty boring
Mar 8 2015,positive,actually enjoyed this 
Mar 8 2015,positive,before seeing the movie i hadnt read the book i think the movie was amazing i think people had higher hopes because they had read the book first and their expectations where high i did read the books after watching the movie and i can tell there are some parts missing but i think the movie is just fine without them  it would be too erotic if everything was transferred letter by letter from the book     cant wait to see the rest of the books being transferred on screen
Mar 8 2015,negative,absolutely awful poor script bad acting wafer thin plot no character history  50 shades of brown
Mar 8 2015,negative,not at all as great as it was hyped up to be just plain awkward at times and lacking the chemistry between the actors
Mar 8 2015,neutral,boring lacked the excitement of the books jamie dunham was a poor christian grey no commanding presence authority or sex appeal i will say though dakota johnson did a much better job than i thought she would not a bad showing from her but she couldnt carry the film i hope they do better with the second movie but to do so they will need to better with the script and recast christian grey not likely i think i will wait until move 2 comes out on cable
Mar 8 2015,negative,fifty shades of disappointment
Mar 8 2015,negative,theres no 50 shades just one shade of gray which is a psychololmaigad this is so bad like twilight bad
Mar 8 2015,negative,surprisingly not the worst thing ive ever seen but not far off reasonable acting from dakota johnson and jamie whatshisface elevate a film about nothing with thinly drawn characters to a dizzying level of mediocrity
Mar 8 2015,positive,you have to accept this movie for what it was i enjoyed it not more than the book but it was still enjoyable for me
Mar 7 2015,positive,this is one of the funniest movies ive ever seen in my life he eats her toast spanks and flogs her but no fisting ok special chocolate only accentuated the entertainment value of this movie
Mar 7 2015,neutral,interesting premise different than i expected more psychological than sexual curious what happens next
Mar 7 2015,positive,really good movie so romantic 
Mar 7 2015,negative,my saw an hour of it review this movie is bad in every way a movie can be and there are two more on the way hmm maybe by the third one she can sign that contract or he could lose that irish accent or the world could explode just sayin
Mar 7 2015,positive,better than the book uncomfortable to watch some scenes good castingbelievable
Mar 7 2015,positive,though it wasnt perfectly aligned to the book i think that was for the better jamie dornan and dakota johnson brought what was a bizarre dialogue at times and made it seem real jamie portrays christians fragility really well and the intimacy between them is heartpounding
Mar 7 2015,neutral,followed the book quite well actually neither were truly good
Mar 7 2015,positive,having not read the books i quite enjoyed it  looking forward to the next instalment 810
Mar 7 2015,negative,pure crap   nothing erotica or entertaining about this movie
Mar 7 2015,positive,amazing movie movie of the year encoreâïâïâï
Mar 7 2015,negative,the only good thing was getting to see jamie dornan half naked 
Mar 7 2015,negative,awful script awful dialogue awful acting waste of time
Mar 7 2015,negative,well first the good um its nicely photographed the actors look good with their clothes off and dakota johnson has at least some screen presence  after that the film is basically about a creepy rich guy who stalks and seduces a naive young woman  jamie dornan is very wooden and just comes off as an obsessive nutcase  the main problem with the film is the lack of a plot not much happens for most of the film and about the halfway mark i started looking at my watch a lot waiting for the film to end its really boring even the sex scenes are boring waste of time and money on this one
Mar 7 2015,positive,great movie book is better but the books are always better the actors portrayed the characters perfectly
Mar 7 2015,positive,3 in a half cuz after  take home sex
Mar 7 2015,positive,i loved the movie and saw it three times
Mar 7 2015,negative,complete and utter trip the book was weak to begin with never was able to find 50 shades greyer had no expectations of the film okay i lie i had hoped it would be more erotic ive been more stimulated handling produce in the grocery  cant even critique the actors as the script  plots and original text were too blah to even attempt to act
Mar 7 2015,negative,wtf is this shit gave it an extra half star bc the dudes hot
Mar 7 2015,negative,history ridiculous  lousy actors  shameful sex scenes   trash   much ado about nothing 
Mar 7 2015,negative,no on screen chemistry i did not picture christian gray to be like him it was not good
Mar 7 2015,negative,sickly movie twisted and warped in every sense its beyond anything thats acceptable or even bearable flat dialogs and a horrible ending
Mar 7 2015,neutral,i saw this film last month and to be honest i actually liked it i mean first and foremost you have to know that the book itself isnt really good so you shouldnt really expect a lot from the film     ive read the book and comparing it to its film adaption i can say that the films way better they made it less about the sex and more about the romantic love story of grey and steele also they gave steeles character some humor which for me was such an important element     in terms of technicalities the film wasnt overtheedge its okay nothing special     in terms of soundtrack the film has superb songs it actually sets up the mood quite well i cried a bit when ellie gouldings love me like you do started playing weird right    in terms of acting dakota did an okay job she started a bit off her character was supposed to be awkwardcute but she made her seem awkward in a bad way jamies portrayal of grey on the other hand was less than okay he pulled of the sexy and lets fuck part but the intimidating part not quite well the way he talked also distracted me i dont know why    all in all i think the films still worth watching and is not as bad as to what peoplehaters are saying im actually giving it a 67 over 10 grade
Mar 7 2015,negative,a complete massive load of bollocks for women over 40 trying to spice up their sex lives bollocks
Mar 6 2015,negative,this film may entice me but i wanted to see the batman version of this fifty shades of wayne which is way more believable than this piece of boring hollywood snuff crap and it doesnt exist looks like ill find a way to jump into another dimension to watch the alternate batman cut instead i bet dakota johnsons chemistry with christian bale works better than with jamie dornan
Mar 6 2015,negative,painful to watch the leads have little to no chemistry and the music is out of a soap opera  terrible
Mar 6 2015,positive,better than the book and sexy hot
Mar 6 2015,positive,interesting story but fed up at the same time 
Mar 6 2015,positive,it was even better the second time
Mar 6 2015,positive,i was looking for edgy sex stuff but found nothing remotely close to rough sex
Mar 6 2015,negative,i was disappointed that the bath scene wasnt as good as it was in the book the film is in my opinion worse than the book and the lead characters didnt display enough emotion in their roles a big let down
Mar 6 2015,negative,in the ranking of badness there are bad films here are films worth to be incineratedand then theres fifty shades of grey seriously if aliens needed a justification to destroy earth this film would be it
Mar 6 2015,positive,well were the critics hell bent on slating mr christian greys sexual idiosyncrasies    i thought the casting was excellent the filming fab and it was a more erotic and sensual version of pretty woman     it gets the thumbs up from me now wheres my whipfor my hot chocolate mmmm
Mar 6 2015,neutral,this is the just gettin started movie parts 2  3 will hopefully be better
Mar 6 2015,positive,i liked the movie  yea it missed a lot from the book but what book that has been made into a movie hasnt
Mar 6 2015,negative,loved the books like a lot and i knew this movie wouldnt do it justice but i just had to see how off it was from the bookthey shouldve let the author get more say in it to make it more like the book going to remember the book just the way it is and not see the other two lol i will admit he did work the christian role and look from some angles better than i thought though
Mar 6 2015,positive,not great not awful  watchable pretty much exactly what i expected i mean how high could your expectations  really be
Mar 6 2015,negative,im still waiting for the storyline
Mar 6 2015,negative,the movie wasugh  dakota johnson completely embodies the character of anastasia  however jamie dornans acting was terrible  i was unable to get lost in the movie because of this attention movie makers i would suggest a different christian
Mar 6 2015,negative,this is the most disappointing movie ive seen  wasnt even close to the standard of the book
Mar 6 2015,neutral,two words overhyped and disappointing also i did not feel that dakota johnston was correctly cast as anastasia she annoyed me at times in the movie whereas in the book itself i never had this issue
Mar 6 2015,negative,awful she was perfect for the part he was not at all
Mar 6 2015,negative,maybe its because expectations were so low maybe its because it was released at the same time as jupiter ascending but dons body armour cuts lights this isnt nearly as terrible as its reputation would suggest      on the surface its actually kind of adequate  sam taylorwoods direction is for the most part network tv drama standard but its really whats needed for a tale like this  she does kind of choke towards the end not yet up to the task of using the codes of cinema to show progression in the third important scene set in the same room with the same characters but shes also smart enough to bring some intentional laughs to the early scenes that undercut the general unlikelihood of the setup  jamie dornan blunders his way through role that hes somewhat miscast is whereas dakota johnson defies expectations and carries herself reasonably well  the script starts totting up the logical inconsistencies in scene one and doesnt let up a college newspaper scores an interview with a billionaire industrialist and lets the assigned journalist chuck a sickie and send her flatmate how small is their journalism programme but its not so much offensive as lazy  and assumes the audience is lazy  and is probably right    for all the furore and handwringing over the films supposed misogyny theres really not a lot to support it  this is the story of a naïve young woman who flirts with the possibility of an unfulfilling and onesided relationship spoiler before growing to a point where she not only walks out but gains the upper hand  if this were a thriller instead of a romantic drama and she cut his balls off instead of walking out itd be hailed as a trashy feminist triumph  yes the film exaggerates anastasias stupidity in the early scenes not because it is misogynist but because it is a hollywood film and its drawn in broad strokes  the women in pygmalion stories are styled to be unrealistically dowdy and anastasia is styled to be unrealistically dumb because it gives her room to grow  outside the central pairing virtually every character in this film who says or does anything is female  it passes the bechdel test with flying colours insert your own grey joke  possibly the closest it comes to real womanhating behaviour is in casting academy award winner marcia gay harden as the mum  if you honestly think this film deserves to be singled out for its treatment of women youve had the pleasure of missing an awful lot of hollywoods output for the past couple of decades    the films portrayal of bdsm and the people who practise it is kind of rubbish its poorly researched and it relies heavily on the naivety of the mainstream audience  that said any offensiveness relies heavily on the fact that in portraying a subject rarely touched on by mainstream film or even in indie film that follows a traditional narrative theres certain to be an extent to which it is taken to be the story of whips  chains romance rather than a story  yes the film centres on a character whose interest in bdsm is suggested to be closely aligned to negative stereotypes of alternative sexuality past abuse and emotional unavailability  but these intimations come principally from other characters  who share the same preconceptions and prejudices as folk in the real world  to criticise the film for taking a negative stance on bdsm is to criticise the characters for their inability to accurately pathologise themselves  if anything it meets the kink community halfway by its declamation that dominance is no excuse for abusiveness and shant be taken as such    is it any good  no not really but benignly rather than offensively so  theres no point rushing out to see it because theres nothing to get excited about but if you saw either of the leads on the poster and thought i could stand to watch something that features that persons arse prominently and its offered on your streaming service of choice half price one day and youve got an enormous pile of ironing or something to do then you could actually do worse
Mar 6 2015,negative,i guess its always hard to make a good film from a highly popular book particularly when the book in questions main selling point was making curiosity about sadomasochistic sexual relationships trendy and mainstream   i can read a book and talk about sm stuff and not feel a weirdo     plus the fact that the movie failed in its prime objective to get some real chemistry between the lead actor and actress well actually i suspect that  the prime reason for making the movie was to make money and it  kinda showed  the male lead had a hard job  he was supposed to be a dominant but actually showed classic submissive behaviour throughout the film  it would appear that the filmmakers were a little sketchy on the nature of sm  topbottom relationships  i cant imagine  although i clearly dont speak for women were much attracted to mr grey however much they might have wanted to be anastasia  steel  also showed a rather transparent lack of pull towards mr grey her best moments were when he took her for a spin in his glider   so a poor to average datemovie where the chap is attractive because hes richi think its been done a thousand times before and often better    mind i was very jealous of the redroom and all the beautiful equipment in it       and miss steele did have a nice bottom
Mar 5 2015,negative,nothing happens there is literally no plot im not even saying this because of the hur due fifty shades is twilight fan fiction garbage circle jerk it is truly a terrible boring movie all on its own
Mar 5 2015,positive,funny to see that all the bad reviews are mostly from men lol i went with a group of girlfriends we all pretty much had read the books and well didnt really go with high expectations needless to say we all enjoyed it very much we thought it was a good adaptation of the book and of course yes it leaves you hanging as it is pretty much the first book we will have to wait for the second and third not sure why all the comments on here are so harsh id see it and will probably see it again  
Mar 5 2015,positive,this movie is vastly underrated it is not what everyone suspects although it does contain some nudity it isnt a porn film the movie contains some drama and conflicting points which diversify this film beyond the casual point of view the acting was fairly good and the film accurately portrayed the book within a 2 hour time slot some minor but important parts were left out
Mar 5 2015,negative,a terrible movie that shamefully proves that a large portion of women will gladly put out for a man who is rich and good looking regardless of how horrible a human being he is
Mar 5 2015,positive,i liked the book better
Mar 5 2015,positive,disappointed to say the least
Mar 5 2015,positive,really loved this film   great soundtrack     would love further detail in narrative in fifty shades darker bringing the tale about icarus flying close to the sun is key i think could have been more dialogue for this aspect as it is a reflection of each character meeting flow of yin and yang energy     awesome movie though highly recommended gave seen it twice    sex is not too much and tasteful   well done jamie dornan dakota and sam taylor johnson  el james    so wonderful to see the books come to life       xx jvk
Mar 5 2015,positive,better than i expected
Mar 5 2015,positive,having read the first book i was of course anticipating a shovel of shit for the movie all the reviews would back this up no idea how i rather enjoyed watching this then infinitely better than the source material which is not much of an accolade of course but still impressed
Mar 5 2015,negative,10100 bad movie that missed on all the possible intriguing scenes i perceived would be there
Mar 5 2015,positive,just like the book i still disliked him  lol  i dont see what all the hype was about for the movie  it was ok but kind of dry overall and uninteresting  the second movie i believe will end up being the hype  it should be alot of better just like the book
Mar 5 2015,positive,this character and the movie is 50 shades of effed up
Mar 5 2015,negative,saw the movie my wife and i being 21 thought it was absolutely terrible   id rather watch a wildlife documentary on discovery channel than this crap
Mar 5 2015,negative,more like 50 shades of shite
Mar 5 2015,negative,seen better love stories on pornhub
Mar 5 2015,negative,big screen adaptation of el james best selling novel by director sam taylorjohnson    jamie dornan plays lead christian grey the awkward good looking billionaire with very singular tastes whilst dakota johnson co stars as anastasia steele the young infatuated virginal english literature major    regardless of whether or not youve read the book the problem with the film is leaving the movie theatre shortchanged by its restrained portrayal of bdsm the sexual scenes are not just a long time in arriving in the movie they are sterile mechanical and absurdly tame    fifty shades should be sexy and dangerous but without even a glimmer of carnal excitement it is a mind numbing excruciating bore that dubiously combines cinderellaesque fantasy with kinky sexy play
Mar 5 2015,positive,while people cant help talking about this film they also keep bashing it  im reminded of titanic and everyone hating leo dicaprio now years after the joke is on them leo is a great actor of his generation and the movie went in history record with multiple awards bullying if its not your cup of tea just go quietly to another shop i say i really liked it if you wanted more explicit sex watch porn theres an asian 3d to help you involve because sex in this movie is an intriguing sexy excuse which might have some educational reward  if you try it in your bedroom just as it is to their characters an excuse of meaningful human interaction as all we know men look at an adventure women look for love  this is a movie thats starts with rules propositions and boundaries but its about pushing limits wanting more daring enticing  a game and how hes lost in his own game he meets the one chance to learn what hes never dare to learn before because of his own false beliefs and the big thick walls he created thinking hed be untouched in protected by control  if you want to dumb down the movie and disregard how often in life you see people making the same mistakes and passing down on love for being stubborn and short sighted then agree with pety critics comments  its your loss  you must then be used to limit youre your capacity to think what movies books painting and artists really have to offer  now technically i think the focus puller needs another job or another crash course i started a game and quickly got pretty tired to look around the frame where the hell is the freaking focus now  direction there are a lot more shots than still shots mrs taylorjohnson there is more that long mid shots  and ill let you in a lil secret  shhhh you can get movement in a shot without being in a glider  how about some dancing how about some free fall  thats what the movie is about side dollys  steadycam and track inout much needed not as a solution but as narrative intention  i know you like dakota but a lot of your choices were wrong needed more christian reacting to the emotion action and the lack of it  spoilers from here on theres one particular example here christians dark past confession  theres a looong shot to the sleeping ana when hes the story  how about some handheld or at least a big spider dolly closing in detail shots to his hands he must have had tight fists tight shoulders he had a freaking fight in him in his face his eyes  all these choices unexploited unexplored  a created moments that could have been use to cashin in psychologicalthriller that is his mind  but  nah   at graduation no reactions at all to mr steel this is c grey annas boyfriend no one thought that was monumentally odd grey is scared of commitment annas never had a boyfriend and dreads greys reaction kate vomits that news out shaking everyone while kate rejoices in the aftermath anna is panicking about so many things and the directorial solution to everything is a short collective mid shot that really seems to belong to another movie completely detached from the truth of every character  poor doesnt cut it mrs director  performances dakota is great  docile shy sublime  though sublime and docile at the end of the bad spanking no shaking no reaction to the belt i dont think so where the awe the shock the disappointment the hesitation shes appalled and she whispers with a few little tears on her face  she orgasms multiple times with a faint exhale really a tiny bit more doesnt hurt anyone its only natural generally dakota reacts to everything shes supposed to react well natural and graceful but i think she needs a bit more dynamic range after all anna seems to be a natural submissive but she doesnt have a submissive bone of in her body just a bit   jamie he has a lot of potential but he can do more id suggest tone inflection and microexpressions training veru short sutil sublime face reactions that reveal in a fraction of a second the true feelings that every human has universal expressions he does them but inconsistently disappointing but i wont put this all on him the director has the power to keep doing retakes until she gets what she wants  so if she took that maybe she didnt know what she needed or misdirected ex the infamouse interview scene and claitons who was he glaring at paul or anna that game needed to be more fun more hot its not the words its how he says the words  christian is always teasing sex with unrelated topics  uncontrollable suggestion book 3 prologue gives you his mind on those scenes completely but in the movie you barely see a tiny glimpse when after that moment they are both hooked reading the of book 3 i was hungry to see all the micro expressions that should have been there the exasperation the confusion the duality i fight the impulse to set the recorder for her im sorry but it needed so much more more expression more inflection more shots  im not sure on the filming order though he tends to remain too much on the inexpressive or tenseclosedoffcontrolling freak mode jamies performance gets increasingly better for a solid end   script im both happy and sad happy because is more real mature and classier without voice over or any remark to the inner goddess and selfconscience a bit sad because it also takes some funny bits  im extremely displeased and hoping for an extended edition on those very important info and plot changers  no one will complain with extra 1530 minutes of film titanic and lord of the rings to verify that the email from savanna and some examples of that exquisite teasing over email the game itself is pretty much missing for such little snippets of the emails my choices would have been different christian not only reassures her by holding her hand but encouraging her to speak up and when she does hes disarmed  the sleep over at here place after she cries when theres no sex because shes upset huge game changer just to mention one  other important things they omit internship interviews   the protective side of kate towards annas wellbeing  the crying nights and joses photo shoot all of these imperative to ground the second film they only needed random short lines in existing dialogues   music and score 1010    i would have loved to write this screen play i can only dream  waiting for film 2 hoping jamie and dakota come back  just have to say this they can always use body doubles  film is creative many ways to make something appear real chris hemsworth kisses his real life wife for a passionate kiss in thor did anyone notice wasnt natalie no one can they are all distracted by the mindblowing passionate kiss but altogether recasting either of them is a crime it would  break the project and is quite insulting
Mar 5 2015,neutral,ok so i never read the infamous books but i still think the film couldve been better it was verging on soft core porn but ive still prob seen some better sex scenes in other films they seemed to lack some chemistry def parts of the film were too tame and boring the characters were one dimensional and the plot was slow moving with awkward dialog i found some parts hard to believe like her being a young virgin and what does he do for a living that being said i still liked watching the sex scenes and it did create a bit of a fantasy who wouldnt want to live in that apt or have a cute mysterious billionaire be obsessed with you
Mar 5 2015,positive,bad developed and stupid dialogues just like the book besides a disappointing performance by jamie dornan on the other hand we have no inner god a film pretty well directed by johnson and an amazing soundtrack fans will enjoy it and we have to admit this was indeed a good start for the franchise
Mar 5 2015,positive,i read all of the books and loved the movie
Mar 5 2015,negative,sam taylorjohnsons character driven erotic romance drama thriller falls flat just ten minutes into the movie the picture has a lot of issues when one is dealing with a drama involving characters or in other words a character driven picture the emphasis all the way should go to how the characters are written  shown and performedthe first major problem which marred the whole narrative was the ludicrously boring and badly written screenplay by the four writers not only are the characters poorly written but also poorly developed throughout the length and breadth of the film and as a consequence it does drags and takes the venom of the plot revolving around the charactersa film which possess erotic romantic scenes must and should be well shown and there is where the direction falls apart none of the romantic scenes throughout the picture have any sense of purpose or moments or even evocative imagery in either direction even thought the scenes are well lit and the plot basically rests on the imagery of the scenes  they just fall flat and redundant as the contract written sam johnson also fails to bring out something special of a terrible screenplay and also the actors now the actors themselves are not bad in portraying what they are told to portray even though they are no way near the potential the lead characters are such one dimensional in nature that nothing interesting can be pulled out of the hat  so the plot was ultimately and constantly reminded to us in form of sms texts and email replies  those were probably the only understanding of the nature of the leads so the whole process of collaboration from the script to the director to the actor stumbled within the first couple of minutes and hence the result is a pretty much the synopsis of the picture from a cinematography point of view  i wouldnt say it was bad on the contrary from a technical side i thought the setting was nicely lit and atmospheric bringing some tension to the otherwise dull storytelling there were also nice use of colors seamus mcgarvey can hold his head high another tool that could have been nicely used was the score which again lacked any sort of purpose in enhancing the picture it was thrown into it to make it sound nice there is no artistry shown by the director in any department which could have enhanced the characters a little bit more than what was written having said all these and well most of them are negative i would like to say the premise of the source material was probably not the best and certainly the casting was too much for non exceptional actors to handle so a potentially bad premise turned into a preposterous screenplay probably shouldnt have made the theaters at all and could have gone straight to video
Mar 5 2015,positive,nothing like the book but as a standalone movie not bad
Mar 5 2015,negative,yesi saw itonly because it was for the one i love and she had read the books that said i actually thought it would be much worse than it was it was watchable but definitely not worth the price of admission stale performances only added to the downfall of this film definitely did not inspire me to read the books however did give me a few ideas
Mar 4 2015,negative,exceptional performance by dakota johnson
Mar 4 2015,positive,i loved it cant wait to see part 2 and 3
Mar 4 2015,negative,a waste of time and as this film is a snafu
Mar 4 2015,negative,i saw about 20 minutes of this movie before i left the dialogue between the two main characters was excruciating please dont see this movie
Mar 4 2015,negative,i thought the book was terrible the movie brings the the terrible to an entirely new level its like a shitty lifetime thriller without the thrill plus mediocre and flat acting zero chemistry between the main characters garbage
Mar 4 2015,neutral,no as good as i hoped
Mar 4 2015,positive,devastatingly moving film about a gay lover and mother losing their world well done netflix for adding this incredible movie to their catalogue
Mar 4 2015,positive,the film left out some key parts of the book that gave the christian grey character more depth and made him appear more humane and caring than the character came across it remains to be seen whether jamie has the emotional range to do this part justice dakota on the other hand was every bit anastasia steele hopelessly in love with christian but not a doormat either looking forward to hearing more from her smart mouth
Mar 4 2015,positive,brilliant cant wait for the next one
Mar 4 2015,positive,as a movie to pass the time fifty shades of grey isnt so bad i really liked the production of this film you can see that they tried to do the best possible especially dakota johnson i really liked her work she got into her character in a really great way i coundt say the same of jamie dornan he doesnt even was just good  i have to admit that i laughed a lot during the first hour a lot
Mar 4 2015,negative,the story had potential but the movie doesnt have the balls to change the book enough to make it interesting some very jarring edits the movie frequently jumps across the axis for one shot in the middle of a scene for no reason
Mar 4 2015,negative,wow havent seen that much skin in a long time  yikes
Mar 4 2015,negative,the only time i got hot and bothered while watching this movie was when the credits rolled cause that meant it was over
Mar 4 2015,positive,all i see is people complaining there wasnt enough sex where does it say films must carbon copy their books this wasnt about sex or bdsm it was about abuse bdsm was merely the tool the intent is clear grey gets off on abuse because he is fifty shades of fcked up he was abused as a child and never knew his mother abuse is all he knows and is as close as he can get to a relationship if you critique the film for not living up to the sex of the book i think youve lost the message that was intended by the director anas no echoes every abuse in particular every rape around the world it was the cry all victims either fail to voice or goes ignored
Mar 4 2015,negative,i am a huge fan of the book i love that its different from any romance novel i know but this movie its just disappointing i think jamie should return to acting school because the only thing that is good about him is his look and of course that look wont last forever i love dakota i think she is funny and beautiful in a way that not many people see the lack of chemistry in this movie does not go unnoticed and of course that is another disappointment from this movie and maybe for those who have read the book i believe you notice that the story in this movie was told way too fast this is the main problem that i have with the movie its just too fast they forgot to put many little details from the book into the movie and because of that i could not have the same connection with the movie that i have with the book so overall i think the movie is only good at making bunch of dollar for the studio but not able to give audience the romance the intimacy and i really hope that the sequel to this movie will satisfy our expectation for the whole trilogy which is basically romance but with a twist
Mar 4 2015,positive,so heres the thing with fifty shades of grey i wanted to hate it so bad that i couldnt     as much as the actors try too hard and its script is awful the overall film isnt that bad its an entertaining two hour mess worth a watch    sadly enough ill be waiting for the sequel
Mar 4 2015,neutral,not as good as the books i was devastated when i went to the cinema to watch it the film skipped past most of the good scenes maybe i think this due to reading the books 5times but i think they done a very poor job making the movie and it spoilt the story for me
Mar 4 2015,positive,love  follows the book beautifully
Mar 4 2015,negative,mixture of thomas crown affair with secretary is that how grey is portrayed as with all the press i imagined he would be more of colin sweeny
Mar 4 2015,positive,it was fantastic
Mar 4 2015,negative,dont waste your money on the movie read the book the book has more detail
Mar 4 2015,negative,watched just over half of the movie and left because i found myself getting annoyed at mr greys behaviour towards anastasia personally i have not read the books but wanted to watch the movie just to see what all the hype was about i think that it is wrong to class this movie as a romance because it is really no such thing i think this implies that emotional abuse is romantic which through personal experience it is not at all it would make young adults think that this kind of behaviour is acceptable which it should not be by any means i am personally not a fan
Mar 4 2015,positive,wow it was good hoping for more though
Mar 4 2015,positive,dakota is adorable and jamie dorman nailed it
Mar 4 2015,positive,i honestly thought i was going to be disappointed with this film but i wasnt i liked it i wondered how in the world would they bring an erotic borderline pornographic book series to the big screen but i have to admit they did well although its no where as graphic or erotic as the books are but still enough to enjoy it the actress for ana dakota johnson wouldve never been my pick for the role but her face is lovely when upclose on camera so that made up for a lot actor for christian was excellent
Mar 4 2015,negative,i refuse to watch porn and call it a movie
Mar 3 2015,negative,fifty shades of grey more like 50 shades of the brownest smelliest dookie that has ever hit the big screen i was in complete shock and awe throughout the entire movie no it wasnt because of any of the sexual orientations it was how ridiculously stupid the movie kept getting its been a while since ive yelled back at screen like i was yelling at an idiot easily in my top dumbest movies of all time
Mar 3 2015,negative,despite lead actress dakota johnsons best efforts to salvage the material which are certainly appreciated and some moments of trashy entertainment fifty shades of grey is a bad movie plain and simple the script while better written than the book not like thats hard but still is still blunt obvious and filled with groanworthy dialogue the talented johnson is saddled with the wooden and stiff and i dont just mean down there jamie dornan as her costar leaving her to desperately grasp for any semblance of screen chemistry the movie may periodically flirt with the direction is handsome yet lacking much real style or personality the plot keeps repetitively dragging along in circles like a bdsmcurious dog chasing its own tail and the titular sex scenes are underwhelming and tame trying too hard to class up and make hollywoodfriendly what should be trashy and shameless top that off with one of the most frustrating and anticlimactic movie endings in recent memory and im left feeling uncertain as to how anyone could be satisfied enough to hunger for the inevitable sequels
Mar 3 2015,positive,it was a very powerful movie
Mar 3 2015,negative,boring and unintetionally laughable
Mar 3 2015,positive,this is of course not good but is shockingly not terrible thanks mainly to dakota johnson managing to portray an actual realseeming person
Mar 3 2015,negative,oh who cares about the synopsis im sure it has been done to death by now gosh i was so ashamed about watching this film and for the first hour i confessed so to my husband i was kind of ashamed about liking this film well not like more not hate   actually its quite an interesting love story for the most part yes it is hokey writing the whole shadow of el james insisting on final cut is all over it it is inconceivably bollocks about the bdms scene considering the bdsm theme it is remarkably vanilla being a film about female sexuality there is a lot more tits and fanny than there is male nudity i mean not one full frontal really queen however i believe the major fault in this film is jamie dornan in all his press junkits he came across as quite clueless and wow does he not sell the dominant here zero chemistry with dakota johnson and just doesnt really look suited scuse the pun to the part i think christian grey needs a more hugh jackman stature about him not read the books but it would seem that he needed to be more of a presence    anyway i did enjoy dakota johnson a lot she completely sold her character and was a joy to behold it is shot really beautifully nice not to obvious grey wash to everything   fortunately for me the film takes a nose dive into the dung heap in the last half the do your worst is ridiculously vanilla and it is all just rather a bit craptastic its like el james took over and though sam taylor johnson was being a bit too good and showing her up pretty awful really   the fault for me lies with jamess final say and dornans horrible acting you wont go to hell for catching this on a plane i heard thoughts saying that this would have been better if it was worse but i think that if the director had been given free rein and christian grey had been better cast this could have actually been quite a compelling film what a fucking shame it really isnt
Mar 3 2015,negative,rated by my sister alison fifty shades of vanilla    men who like to please their women should see fifty shades of grey women who like hot irishmen and think they love being dominated in the sack should see it too while its absolutely not the most erotic movie youll ever see its better than its source material and much fun to see with galpals like i did or i would think your romancesex partner    the movie sucks because christian grey is such a dom that he has not only a playroom well appointed with only the finest in to be sure bespoke leather sex toys but also one of those airtight slave contracts yet the movie wants us to believe that a grossly immature unworldly alltogether average beauty makes him break his own contract and own rules one by one almost immediately after meeting her    the anastasia character tops from the bottom throughout the movie this should be obvious to anyone whos even remotely read about or dabbled in bdsm a master like christian grey would anticipate this and probably not be willing to let it happen basically it wouldnt get him hard but this is a movie for women who like their sexuality to be 97 vanilla with just a sprinkle of kink the movie is much tamer than i even thought it would be and even in the fuckyouspeechless throes of gettin it on christian uses a condom every single time we even get to see that familiar intimate moment where the guy rips the condom wrapping open with his teeth and slaps on that sucker the movie is just that responsible    the movie sucks because anastasia steele is a virgin who according to her own admission hasnt even done other stuff this confession drives christian grey wild with desire for her he even wonders at the thought that men mustve been throwing themselves at her for years while she remained oblivious to her charms  the chief charm being an obnoxious tendency to bite the pillow of her bottom lip this is seriously what we called it at true story true confessions and the lot the message seems clear all those cosmo articles are dead wrong guys dont want an experienced woman who knows and relishes her own sexuality guys want a virgin they can train with their main vein sloppy seconds are for suckers    mr grey pops anastasias cherry approximately three minutes after she fesses up to it then they do it in the miss posish akathe normal way the first time so she can develop a taste for it you know  because selfmade business magnates have all sorts of extra time on their hands to be at a girls beck and call and tenderly tend to her innocent blossoming needs and uncertainties every woman knows this guy every woman has at some time in her life had to put up with an obscenely handsome tycoonlevel hottie who wants to spend all his time with her cater to her every need and possess her erotic and romantic life forever and ever and ever and ever yeah sure    you see now why this is a perfect chick flick because it says this guy exists he is out there waiting for you and only you you can dress dowdy you can be dumber than a deflated blowup doll no matter what he wants you all of you this is the idea that makes the movie a great flick for couples guys if you want to know what many women want  even just a little bit  and make them all lust for your cashmerescented wang watch this movie take notes and then act like christian grey for the rest of your life in addition please own and be able to fly your own helicopter and if your new girlfriend wants to go visit her mother dont take it for a muchneeded break from the needy nagging ballandchain  secretly fly down there in your gorgeous weekend clothes and just show up while your lady and her mom are having brunch this is super hot    sadly the movie isnt super hot you have to wait for just about the last 12 minutes of the flick to see even a remotely decent whipping and it only lasts for six lashings by his own admission christian grey likes to fuck hard but from what we see the dude doesnt have any amazing sexual skillz hes a twominute brother and he begins every sexual encounter by getting down on his knees and kissing his way down anastasias belly on a lick trip to her nethers seriously if i were dating him the minute he got down on his knees and started unbuttoning my jeans id think guess were gonna do it and heeeerrre we go again the movie traffics in that precise kind of cinematic shorthand we know that christian grey is unbelievably wealthy  not to mention meticulous  because his penthouse is enormous and cold with lots of white marble flooring and all of that sparse modern furniture that all rich people love by the same shorthand it only takes a few seconds of backstory to establish what we figured anastasias roommate is an earthy blonde who puts out on the first date you know that roommate    jamie dornan makes a decent christian grey he seems to be missing some sort of light in his eyes and we never get to see his full dominating dong but hes got a great body a terrific head of hair and as befitting a former model he makes the clothes look good good good as for dakota johnson  she should stick to light romantic comedy shes darling and we can see her full ribcage every time she undresses but she doesnt scream intelligence and one gets the idea that she has precisely one layer of mystery and that layer is made out of calico and lace i do have to admit that i find it refreshing to see that such a sweet simple sunshiney girl came out of the union of melanie griffith and don johnson note to the ladies when you take off your top can you see every single bone and piece of cartilage in your ribcage if your answer is no you are an ugly pig and pretty much the entire world cant believe you have the audacity to think that some guy or girl would ever love you
Mar 3 2015,positive,im giving 3 stars literally just because u see dakota johnson naked for 2 hoursother than that this movie is so far fetched is implausible garbage
Mar 3 2015,negative,two words soft porn  how cheap can a woman be bought and used doesnt matter when you are rich but even though there is more  she is still cheap
Mar 3 2015,positive,i thought it was good 
Mar 3 2015,neutral,56  while fifty shades of grey started horribly it gradually improved as it went along by adding some humour and having dakota johnson deliver a likeable lead performance who only looked better opposite jamie dornan who id say is the films second biggest weakness with the biggest being the script which is riddled with cringeworthy lines of dialogue even the twilight franchise would even be embarrassed to use another major problem is the useless characters and even some useless scenes prime examples being anastatias best friend jose and the grey family dinner scene  overall it was not as bad as i expected but its 2 big weaknesses are too distracting for you to be truly invested in the film
Mar 3 2015,negative,horrible and boring what was all the hype about women loved this book why
Mar 3 2015,positive,i love this movie it was just put together really good and i would see it again
Mar 3 2015,positive,if you have read the book this is a good adaptation  people have criticized jamie dornans portrayal of christian grey but that is how he reads in the book as well  it isnt until the second book that he really develops a personality  i thought the movie actually had a little more fun with itself than the book did
Mar 3 2015,negative,there is absolutely no plot i didnt expect the film at all to interest me or intrigue me in any way but it was way worse than even that it does not make sense and in no way is realistic in any aspect i have not read the books but what i have heard from many friends and company is that it gives the book no justice even the book is a terrible piece of literature so disappointed in myself for wasting my money
Mar 3 2015,positive,of course its not exact like the bookbut it was amazing
Mar 3 2015,positive,the book is better than the movie
Mar 3 2015,negative,unfortunately this movie did not move me in any way shape or form it really lacked chemistry between the characters it really lacked tension between the characters i was thoroughly unimpressed with the ultra rich guy who has a thang for a common class girl disappointed will read the book instead
Mar 3 2015,positive,pretty much what you expect
Mar 3 2015,positive,surprisingly i loved this movie bring your note padsome great ideas in this flik in fact many couples got up and left im sure to go home and get a beating im sure
Mar 3 2015,positive,absolutely amazing performances i loved this movie it isnt too far off from how the book portrayed the story
Mar 3 2015,positive,it wasnt quite right but it was a good effort his part needs more work
Mar 2 2015,negative,i was really curious about the movie because everybody was talking about it im absolutely shocked about how boring and bad the movie is people these days have no taste
Mar 2 2015,negative,absolutely no chemistry no romance and very very boring sex
Mar 2 2015,positive,love this movie can wait for the second one 
Mar 2 2015,negative,too long too corny
Mar 2 2015,positive,i liked it actually not nearly as terrible as it was made out to be
Mar 2 2015,negative,the book was much better this darted around to much it tried to make up lack of content with nudity
Mar 2 2015,negative,kinda boring i expected more it was built up way too much
Mar 2 2015,negative,the movie is boring a total waste of money the chemistry between  dakota and jamie was non existent there was so much hype about the sexual content and to me there is more sexual content in some tv series than on this movie total disappointment
Mar 2 2015,neutral,i heard that this wasnt so good
Mar 2 2015,negative,my wife the fifty shades fan fell asleep in the middle of an sm scene if the movie did that to her just try to imagine how early into it i was dozing off already
Mar 2 2015,positive,cant wait till its on dvd
Mar 2 2015,negative,amateurish with very weak performances by the stars  a lifetime tv movie with boobs  was the book this bad
Mar 2 2015,negative,i was so looking forward to this movie although the books were not written by the most seasoned writer she never claimed to be i knew that of her so it came as no shock while i was reading her books i did love her story i felt a connect with the characters i want to see to their change and growth this said i knew if they came with a movie it would be hard to meet my personal vision  i was excited to see them try though nothing against this actor but they started off with a poor choice in mr grey i must say  now that i have seen the movie  i see that wasnt the end of my disappointment this movie was terrible im sad to say i knew it would be hard for hollywood to move around the sex but that wasnt even the part i cared about which i believe the same goes for most readers the story line was my favorite part they had so much to work with and they did nothing with it i dont know maybe they gave it to amateur film makers to keep with the theme it was a major fail   disappointed fan
Mar 2 2015,negative,not as good as the book but looking forward for the next lol
Mar 2 2015,negative,watched this with an open mind and it was truly awful poor acting a lot missing that was in book the ending was atrocious
Mar 2 2015,positive,it was good but didnt like the ending
Mar 2 2015,negative,sorry but i am going to whip i mean rip this film apart with my review oh you poor servants who have been dominated by a novel to go see the film adaptation of fifty shades of grey director sam taylorjohnson constructs an uneven unbridged and unexciting film in fifty shades of grey with all due apologies taylorjohnson is the grey goose here i think she should have spiced it up with an 80s soundtrack consisting of back in the chain gang whip it and of course sex im a as most of you know this film is about a literary student named anastasia steele who meets a young billionaire named christian grey grey is soft spoken and sly but he has a fetish for bondage sm whipping etc grey romances anastasia and tries to persuade her to sign a dominantsubmissive tobemylover contract it was about this time that i felt that the filmmakers of this garbage needed was a good spanking from their studio heads even though that is far from happening since the movie has brought in chains of box office gold jamie dornan plays grey and dakota johnson is steele dornan was dormant with his performance and johnson did not provide any scenesteeling work in my book fifty shades of grey was as shady as they come and i mean that literally    failure
Mar 2 2015,positive,interesting insight into a relationship  in this example of a dominant and submissive relationship how the submissive hold much of the power consider going to folsom in san francisco to be educated on more than 50 shades of grey
Mar 2 2015,positive,beautiful movie very much like the book great love scenes if you read the book you will love this movie
Mar 2 2015,negative,the tomatoes of the movie while a bit a moist were also undercooked while the tortilla was fine i felt that it was too temporary the cinnamon of the entire performance lacked the depth to convince me that it was truly hell although the drag queen shoes were on the larger side its fine because director sam taylor johnson specified that it was a shared dessert despite the fact that there were walrus bones in it overall they were no sweet genius 15
Mar 2 2015,positive,if you read the book youll love the movie the characters did great playing their role i went to watch it with all my gfs and we all loved the movie the whole theatre was mostly all women 
Mar 2 2015,negative,terrible in all ways when the audience laughs during dramatic scenes its a sign dont waste your time and money
Mar 2 2015,neutral,i didnt buy it when hearing so many people say it didnt worth the money but now i do with all the amazing songs and wickedly cutting the trailer is way better than the movie jamie is not the christian that i pictured when reading the books jesus he only got one emotion on his face and he doesnt look like that type of guy who can easily make girl blush although he does have seductive abs worse still he and ana had no chemistry at all however dakotas acting is fantastic she was naive caring and lively just like the one in the books the movie failed to cover the whole book which made it a little bizarre  seeing every scene just come out without any signal hope the second movie will be better i still like the book
Mar 2 2015,positive,nicely done good chemistry between the actors of course the book is better
Mar 2 2015,positive,flat plot but great theme about control actually mor than just a sex movie
Mar 2 2015,negative,after reading the book i expected more content in the movie
Mar 2 2015,negative,dakota johnson is a horrendous actress and it definitely shows a terrible movie that should never have been made or at least this way  lets hope they say screw it and leaves this kinda stuff to the professionals ron jeremy
Mar 2 2015,negative,let me start with i loved the book but the film version was terrible  it seemed that they tried to fit in everything which resulted in these choppy segments that really didnt mean anything when all put together  i am really disappointed in this film i had no emotional investment in any of the actors the could have died at any point in the film and i couldnt have cared 
Mar 2 2015,negative,never cared to read the books and shouldntve wasted my time on the movie
Mar 2 2015,negative,i want my money back
Mar 2 2015,negative,i tried being a tourist in mass culture and attended this movie  i didnt have the stomach to go the distance  horrific screenplay awkward acting difficult concept and tepid sex  this is a milestone on the road to indifference
Mar 2 2015,positive,i did not expect much and i had fun 
Mar 2 2015,negative,the future of adult films is here
Mar 2 2015,negative,ugh ana is the biggest mary sue ever written for the silver screen christian grey for the record is a sociopath and a sadist not to mention a psycho minor spoiler there is a scene is where he surprises ana by showing up in georgia for the sheer fact she went to visit her mom on the weekend instead of spending it with him even though she was with him like yesterday like what the  dude creepy thank god anas character finally developed some brain cells
Mar 2 2015,positive,better than i thought was gonna be
Mar 2 2015,negative,a horrendous film that offers fifty reasons to stay away
Mar 2 2015,positive,wasnt really that bad
Mar 1 2015,negative,sticking a nail in your fingertips and scraping your bones would be more pleasurable
Mar 1 2015,negative,stupid as movie seen it about a week ago idk whats the big fuss about them books people put this movie way high at a pet a stooldisappointing
Mar 1 2015,negative,look this isnt going to be a review that raves about how good this film is because it truly is trash i feel as though this film is a genius picture on many levels due to its manipulative styles and ways of getting people into the theatre looking back on fifty shades of grey it really was just a marketing tactic for a certain demographic sure fans of the book watched it and may have got some enjoyment out of it but the story accompanied by the godawful dialogue really does make this film a treat to watch even if you can admit how bad it is i have no idea how seriously the books are to be taken nor do i ever intend on finding that out but this film is an absolute blast to watch because the dialogue is completely ridiculous here is why you should check out fifty shades of grey even though its terrible    following anastasia steele and christian grey as they meet through a business meeting she quickly becomes infatuated with him only to realize that there is a lot more to him behind the scenes tormented by the fact that he likes to inflict pain onto women who enjoy it he is very heavy into bdsm accepting her as his girlfriend and trying to get her to sign a nondisclosure agreement to participate in these events that would pleasure him their relationship grows in very strange ways filled with horribly written dialogue and a plot that really doesnt go anywhere this first instalment doesnt do to get fans to return although im sure the readers will be there on day one of all three films    while the story of this film is obviously not to be taken too seriously the performances in both dakota johnson and jamie dornan definitely lifts the film from the ashes in my opinion there chemistry may not be perfect but they do give these roles their all especially johnson these are some of the most irrelevant and dumb characters i have seen onscreen in quite some time but their performances are what make them bearable there are times when the dialogue coming out of their mouths is so terrible that i can do nothing but chuckle but anastasia could be completely in tears there was clear effort in making this film better than it    the main reason people flocked out to see this film was clearly due to the shock value people who hadnt read the books were curious people who knew it was going to be a poor film wanted a good laugh and fans of the book were hoping to be satisfied but were the scenes memorable in any way memorable in the sense that they are solely done for shock value yes but they really arent that shocking especially when they are limited even with an r rating i did not go into this film hoping these scenes would be great though i was hoping for great chemistry and compelling characters which was a mistake from the very beginning having said all of this these sequences should please fans of the book in that way i guess the film does its job    in the end fifty shades of grey sets out to please the fans and draw in interested people that is exactly what it accomplished and absolutely nothing more with wooden characters and a plot that centres solely around the fact that a woman is unsure if she should be trusting this man there really isnt much substance to be had overall as i said it does its core job for fans but newcomers will either roll their eyes find it funny or walk out released on valentines day as are the sequels its the perfect spot for a film like this especially if they are in the mood for some cash returns fifty shades of grey is a very very bad film but undeniably accomplished its goal for that i give it a few props
Mar 1 2015,negative,a complete and utter failure in all aspects if you want quality eroticism in film please seek out blue is the warmest color and in the realm of the senses
Mar 1 2015,negative,50 shades of bullshit
Mar 1 2015,negative,the book was better they do nothing to develop why these two have any interest in each other at all oh well it could have been done better the actors could have made it happen but the direction was lacking lots of missed opportunities to make it the movie what it should have been
Mar 1 2015,positive,i expected more if you do not expect anything than its a okay movies
Mar 1 2015,positive,dude that stared was hot and perfect to plat christian grey
Mar 1 2015,negative,emotionally stagnant and incredibly one dimensional 50 shades of grey might as well be a parody of a parody for it fails to do anything right the only saving grace being dakota johnsons performance albeit a very simple character
Mar 1 2015,positive,didnt read the book so i think that helped me enjoy the movie i thought both actors did a great job it was sensual yet not pornographic im looking forward to the next two installments
Mar 1 2015,positive,i really liked this movie  not sure why the reviews are so harsh  i thought the leading actors were well suited for their parts  it wasnt as thorough as the book but they had to squeeze it into two hours  jamie dornan was gorgeous and really brought christian greys character to life and dakota johnson who i was completely unfamiliar with before seeing this movie did a really good job as anastasiaso what is everyones issue  im not sure but i am glad i saw it
Mar 1 2015,negative,for something so popular i was disappointed to find fifty shades of grey was so tame and boring  it basically plays out like a mousy virgin girls sexual fantasy of a brooding handsome stranger inexplicably being drawn to her and introducing her to new sexual experiences  the funny thing is that the chemistry between the characters and the bdsm is so mild it makes me question how this franchise generated so much buzz
Mar 1 2015,negative,picture the author of twilight trying to tell a story about bsmd
Mar 1 2015,negative,thats 2 hrs i wont ever get back i read the books and was curious about movies the actors were horrible zero chemistry the movie was immensely boring the parts of the book i remotely liked where left out the sex wasnt even any good save yourself and dont bother watching this crap  your time would be used better counting blades of  grass
Mar 1 2015,negative,horrifically bad storytelling acting and moviemaking combine for a laughable fraud of a film
Mar 1 2015,neutral,hohum romance with pg rated bdsm
Mar 1 2015,neutral,not my type of film but is worth a watch i think
Mar 1 2015,negative,absolutely boring with a bland dialogue the sex scenes just show how much of a mess this movie is dont expect the next two movies to be any good all we can do is sit back and laugh at the fan girls praising this movie
Mar 1 2015,positive,i read the book so book is always more thorough but the movie was on point i didnt like the fact he actually hit her so hard ive heard of dominatrix but i thought it was for pleasure for both not so painful i thought it was just for control not to harm lesson learned
Mar 1 2015,positive,very entertaining could be longer though
Mar 1 2015,positive,okay the book is better but the movie in general is really good
Mar 1 2015,negative,you cant make a good film based on a terrible book
Mar 1 2015,negative,the movie doesnt do justice to the book jamie dornan makes the scenes very awkward his mediocre acting ruins it all dakota is depicted as shy quiet and barely there so different than the character with a sharp personality that speaks her mind in the book
Mar 1 2015,negative,horrible actinghorrible movie
Mar 1 2015,neutral,even though i thought the books were pretty dreadful i had to see the movie to form my own opinion it wasnt as bad as i thought it was going to be but it wasnt good either it was very slow in places and i imagine to anyone that hasnt read the books it was a bit like wtf i thought the performances were alright dakota johnson and jamie dornan have a bit of chemistry not enough though imo it was cast pretty well though and the soundtrack is very good it will be interesting to see what the sequel is like
Mar 1 2015,negative,absolute boring tame crap

Mar 1 2015,negative,universal clearly wanted a female director for this one but sam taylorjohnson has a very thin resume mostly shorts and just one feature that no one saw   her directing inexperience showed  this was completely devoid of heat chemistry or charm  i later watched 9 12 weeks and saw how deftly adrian lyne handled a somewhat similar subject
Mar 1 2015,positive,this movie is awesome ive read a few of these reviews and from what ive seen most of them are guys   i loved this movie and i think to enjoy the movie as much you need to read the book yes some people say its badly written but you just have to get into it to have a deeper depth knowledge of the movie   but its all in your taste but in my opinion read the book and watch the movie
Mar 1 2015,negative,just terrible not worth the time writing a long review boring sex scenes are meh nothing really happens and when it does it makes no sense not good at all
Mar 1 2015,negative,this movie simply fails on every level with an absurdly abysmal dialog weak acting and next to no chemistry between the lead actors makes this movie unbearable to watch
Mar 1 2015,positive,follows book fairly well  enjoyed books 2  3 more so may give sequels better rating  overall story line is good
Mar 1 2015,positive,i believe that it was casted well it had a good story and message

Mar 1 2015,positive,its good there are alot of part in the book that is not in the movie but its still good
Mar 1 2015,positive,i didnt agree with the pick of mr gray though dakota johnson did a decent job  it was pretty true to the book it made me cringe when he would say later baby books much better
Mar 1 2015,positive,jamie dornan is hot i felt like the movie stayed pretty true to the book the few things left out were barely noticeable and the overall feeling from the book was captured anas clumsy insecure inexperienced character is portrayed perfectly while christian is smoking hot closed off and clearly more that what you see on the surface i loved it cant wait to go see it again just what i expected and so much more
Mar 1 2015,positive,better than expected
Mar 1 2015,positive,pretty good movie didnt understood what is all the fuss about
Mar 1 2015,neutral,theres a perverse giddy joy to be had from watching awful dialogue from the book escape the lips of these actors most of whom do a valiant job rounding out the onenote characters theyre playing and i dont often say this but no wang come on hollywood level the playing field
Mar 1 2015,negative,one long weird rape fantasy some strange people outchea
Mar 1 2015,neutral,neither competent nor graphic enough to stand on its own fifty shades of grey will struggle to resonate with any of its audience
Mar 1 2015,neutral,neither competent nor graphic enough to stand on its own fifty shades of grey will struggle to resonate with any of its audience
Mar 1 2015,negative,film moves rather slow found myself bored out of my mind after 45min acting chops in the film were non existent dont be surprised if they decide to reboot this in a few years
Mar 1 2015,positive,i enjoyed this more than i thought and james dornan played a good christian wasnt who i expected to play the part but good match the play room scenes were done well ending was disappointing
Mar 1 2015,negative,i would give zero stars if i could it was boring and full of bad acting
Mar 1 2015,positive,would like to of seen more in the red room
Mar 1 2015,positive,love it i can wait to see the next one 
Mar 1 2015,negative,even at the height of its popularity especially when the 1st edition came out i just knew hollywood would not keep their hands of this one no matter how ridiculous the whole concept is i guess this is where i should admit that i havent read the book so this review wont be comparing the two or complaining about what the movie did or didnt do from the book no this review is just going to be based around the actual movie and for the life of me i cant see what all the hype is about this el james erotic best seller was actually conceived as a twilight fan story i cant even begin to imagine the level of atrocity that would have given birth to if the idea was picked up in the original over hyped mediocre twilight series anyways lets gets to the plot the story follows anastasia steele dakota johnson a depressingly ordinary college girl who goes through life without many close friends outside her roommate leads an existence of convention and routine this changes when her roommate asks her to interview christian grey jamie dornan an elusive single billionaire whos consistent protection of his private life has warranted great question from the moment she sees him anastasia is smitten with everything about him because he is everything she isnt bold confident unafraid and suave one can tell just from the way christian looks and speaks to anastasia having great patience and acceptance with her that he admires her for her own traits as well shes simple frightened vulnerable and just the kind of girl hes looking for the two quietly hit it off with christian requesting simple things like coffee outings and simple hangouts before going through one of his many periods of being standoffish and confusing to anastasia eventually he reveals his motives hes looking for a sexual relationship with no commitments and no conventionality in terms of going on dates he wants sex and he wants it his way proposing a contract to anastasia in hopes she will become the submissive to his dominant in which shell stay at his spacious penthouse on weekends to engage in wild sexual escapades yup this is the plot of an actual movie not your usual porn production from digital playground or naughty america people actually invested in this movie there are all sorts of major issues with the film we can start with the laughable screenplay which would have been rejected by the lifetime channel and in fact im going to guess that it would have been rejected has a fiveyearold written it the dialogue is without question some of the most laughable ive heard in a very long time in fact the movie seems to be lost in what decade it is because there are times that the f word is used and its used in a way to where its supposed to be shocking really its going to take more than that the entire character development between the two lead characters is another joke and after a while you really cant buy into any of the melodrama and youve just got to sit back and laugh yet another problem is that the film just isnt erotic films like fatal attraction basic instinct 8mm are just a few examples that qualify as erotic films a lot of the lack of eroticness has to be blamed on the director who just seems to have been the wrong fit for the material nothing from the erotic nature to the serious stuff works and everything is poorly edited dakota johnson and jamie dornan fit their roles pretty well they are good looking  awkward i guess thats how they are supposed to be however the two completely lack any kind of chemistry together like i mentioned above the plot was originally meant to be twiligth fan fiction we cant help but notice the similarities between the lead protagonists in comparison to the very boring edward  bella maybe thats intentional again alluding to greys refusal to make this a relationship of any conventionality but its difficult to get wrapped up in the sex scenes when both parties seem disinterested in one another and bored furthermore the acting of the two leads varies from acceptable to incredibly poor and contrived on the whole fifty shades of grey may go down as one of the most poorlywritten films of the film year in terms of having singular lines of dialog that are capable of producing unintentional laughs and sneers  combine the elements of bad dialog with unremarkable sex scenes and an an overall idiotic portrayal of a sex subculture and you have a film that flatlines where it should have stunned  entertained just as mr gray had said this is fifty shades of fd up
Mar 1 2015,negative,the plot is something a teenager could come up with dull and predictable and the entire film hinges on a few erotic scenes that other films have done far better     no matter how they spin it the two main characters need serious therapy for their deep seeded erotic urges that the film tries to pass off as something wholesome
Mar 1 2015,negative,the girlfriend says that it is better then the book but is that really a compliment i dont think so in my humble opinion the movie is nothing but fluff with very little going for it but then im not the target audience for this the girlfriend loved it and thats all that really matters in the end    if you are a fan of the books go and see it if not find something better to spend your money on
Feb 28 2015,negative,the half was because it was about as bad as i expected but  not quite
Feb 28 2015,negative,dumb fell asleep in real life this woman would call this guy a psycho stalker
Feb 28 2015,positive,jamie and dakota played christian and ana phenomenally i do wish it was longer and had a little more from the book but i enjoyed every minute of this movie cant wait for darker and freed 
Feb 28 2015,negative,i would give this movie a zero if i could i literally almost started bawling after an hour had gone by i told my boyfriend do you know how much of a slap in the face this is to lit intellectuals just drop out of college write cheap sex novels and make millions over night its so sad simplistic idiotic poorly written scripts like this are tossed out there and people actually eat it up porn is a dollar online you dont need to pay 10 for this movie at the theater just buy soft porn online cheaper probably  maybe even youll get a better plot
Feb 28 2015,negative,i would give this movie a zero if i could i literally almost started bawling after an hour had gone by i told my boyfriend do you know how much of a slap in the face this is to lit intellectuals just drop out of college write cheap sex novels and make millions over night its so sad these simplistic idiotic poorly written scripts liked this are tossed out there and people actually eat it up porn is a dollar online you dont need to pay 10 for this movie at the theater just buy soft porn online cheaper and probably maybe even youll get a better plot
Feb 28 2015,negative,i feel asleep about 10 mins in
Feb 28 2015,negative,terrible just stay home with your woman if shes hot and put on some nice decent hairless porn with a reasonable storyline
Feb 28 2015,positive,loved it i cant wait to see the next one
Feb 28 2015,negative,this was the first movie ive ever seen where ive wanted to leave early it never managed to catch my attention with the cheesy dialogue and awkward situations
Feb 28 2015,neutral,softcore masodrama with a few hot scenes all things considered pretty vanilla stuff
Feb 28 2015,positive,the movie added a touch of humor that nicely offset the more intense mood that was predominant in other scenes the acting at times felt forced between the two leads overall not a bad movie
Feb 28 2015,negative,too much anticipation for nothing 
Feb 28 2015,positive,an amazingly gorgeous movie besides the incessantly annoying giggling women in front of us
Feb 28 2015,negative,seriously wtf has hollywood come to we dont want more of this twilight shite
Feb 28 2015,positive,loved it  was pretty much exactly like the book accept for 23 scenes and jamie  dakota played christian and anastasia perfectly
Feb 28 2015,negative,fifty shades of shit 
Feb 28 2015,positive,better than the godawful books in that the movie seems to have a sense of humor about the ridiculousness of this relationship the only redeeming quality of the books were that it achieved what it was intended to achieve  erotic stimulation  but quality writing they were not much of the wording was regurgitated and overused to the point of absurdity but what was anyone really expecting dh lawrence it is most definitely not the movie at least had a tongue in cheek sensibility when the topic of sm came into play i think the actors did their best considering the driveling premise they had to work with the movie like the books achieved the same level of erotic stimulation and therefore wasnt nearly as bad as it could have been all the talk of the dornan  johnson lacking chemistry didnt seem accurate to me bottom line ill see the followup movies but im not expecting to see a thoughtprovoking profound piece of cinema
Feb 28 2015,negative,this movie was so boring and the love scenes were boring and anticlimactic  the characters had no real depth  i was not excited to see the movie based on  the previews and it was actually worse than i thought it would be
Feb 28 2015,negative,i would rate it negative if i could
Feb 28 2015,neutral,not even a boner i shouldve read the book
Feb 28 2015,negative,while being well shot 50 shades of grey is filled with gruesome dialogue terrible chemistry from the character it doesnt neglect and somehow succeeded in the seemingly impossible task of making sex boring
Feb 28 2015,positive,the ending omg
Feb 28 2015,negative,a setback for cinema beyond the absurd dialogues the cold cinematography or poor character development its stylized depiction of gender violence submission and sexual slavery are awfully approached since these issues seem to be acceptable and rewarding in this modern society
Feb 28 2015,positive,lots of t and a so so acting could of been better shows lots of her naked and hardly of the guy for the ladies who wants to know
Feb 28 2015,positive,i finally saw the fifty shades of grey movie and it was an okay film    i didnt really had a problem with the graphic sex in the film  some of which were left to the imagination    however there was a lack of chemistry between the two leads  that have to improve for the sequel    overall it was a decent film to watch and a good one to see for a matinee fare    i give it a grade of an b    enjoy
Feb 28 2015,neutral,as a fan of romantic books and a fan of this book i was disappointed at how they werent as detailed i felt like they had missed out on a lot of important things reading the book i fell in love with the characters and was drawn to it but not so in the movie all did was put a face on the characters i believe they made so much money is because people had high expectations which for someone who read the book like me i did so if ever they do make a second movie i hope they can be more detailed because the 2nd book was pretty amazing and dont disappoint the fans again
Feb 28 2015,neutral,average at best nothing much happens for all the hype
Feb 28 2015,neutral,demonization of an already troubled character christian is substantially more cruel and cold in the movie its almost as if the director didnt want a sequel made and was trying to outrage all women everywhere
Feb 28 2015,negative,this movie is a waste of money not even a third of the first book was brought to the screen the acting in this movie was horrible and honestly i think a someone off the street could have done a better job
Feb 28 2015,negative,bad movie boring and predictably
Feb 28 2015,positive,good movie guys take your wife to see this movie you will have a great night after
Feb 28 2015,positive,storyline was pretty close to the book  unlike other books to movies twilighti am glad they did not change it to fit hollywood
Feb 28 2015,positive,i loved fifty shades
Feb 28 2015,negative,i gave 1 star for the actors otherwise the movie is crap and story goes nowhere
Feb 28 2015,negative,despite having its moments it is unable to ascend the paper thin plot and at times laughable dialogue
Feb 28 2015,positive,book was better but ok
Feb 28 2015,neutral,the movie wasnt as bad as i expected it was a little silly at parts but not completely unwatchable
Feb 28 2015,positive,i didnt read the book im not the target anyways and i just watch the trailer and hear the soundtrack before even want to see it that said  the movie is fine the bdsm is well treated and dakota johnson is the star of the whole film her acting is so lovable that the final scene is truly heartbreaking and that final part christain ana is a perfect finale
Feb 28 2015,negative,the muchanticipated adaptation of the poorly written literary atrocity is about as interesting as an rrated twilight film just because you add some sex your characters dont transcend their bland romance and terrible dialogue samtaylor johnson did what she could with the material and scrapped the inner monologue thank christ and i cannot deny that the film is shot well and that dakota johnson has presence and wit oncamera the positives end there this story is a complete fantasy and in no reality i can fathom would a woman tolerate an obsessive stalkertype even if he was super rich and i feel it is degrading how quickly she became infatuated with him just because he has a fucking helicopter i dont think ive ever seen more inconsistent characters before in my life with the constant flipflop of being okay with the sm then wanting intimacy then him saying he wont give it then totally does and by the end i did not give a crap about their relationship jamie dornan is merely okay as the lead though hes sorely missing the intimidating quality about him required and youll be rolling your eyes at some of the things he has to say the selling point everyones losing their shit over is obviously the sex scenes which while pushing the boundaries of the r rating dont amount to much and feel repetitive after the first night fifty shades of grey is an overlong gimmickmovie with no conflict no realism and zero credibility in the writing department and if youre into the whole taboo sm stuff watch secretary instead
Feb 28 2015,positive,hot movie  i couldnt get through the first chapter in the books because they bored me but i loved the movie mmmm mmm mmm
Feb 28 2015,negative,it was nothing like the book very disappointing
Feb 28 2015,negative,i think some books should not be movies
Feb 28 2015,positive,the book gets one star to be able to make a great movie out of it deserves 4 stars
Feb 28 2015,positive,i liked it i dont know why everyone hated it of course it will never b as good as the book no movie ever is i think the actor and actress played the parts well 
Feb 28 2015,negative,felt everything was rushed and the acting completely mediocre
Feb 28 2015,positive,i have not read the books yet but i have heard about what the books were about  i was very interested when i found out they were making a movie when i saw this movie i wasnt expecting it to be as good as i thought it was going to be i loved the connection between christian grey  anastasia steeles characters it was believable  i bought the bond they had i think dakota johnson played anastasiawell  it many ways i could relate to her jamie dornan definitely has the looks  he pulls off the mysterious vibe as soon as you meet his character you want to know more about him i especially liked the ending to the film i thought it was a good ending to a sequel  for that reason it made me want to find out whatll happen next between the two i also loved the whole picture to the movie even thought the movie is very dark it has a clean background with lots of glass  sharp light colours such as a lot of grey black white which makes this movie very enticing the only negative thing i have about this movie is jamie dornans character as christian grey trying to sell those seductive  dirty talking lines i couldnt help but laugh when its not suppose to be funny but overall id give the movie a 55 especially loved the comedic scrnes with anastasia they were funny
Feb 28 2015,negative,needs a different actress playing the lead not some sappy female but a really beautiful women who is smart and witty and can hold a decent conversation someone who can stimulate verbally since the book shows highly educated people and their strong vocabularies the entire movie doesnt adequately address the subliminal beauty of the book
Feb 28 2015,negative,very disappointed read all the books and enjoyed them very much the movie did the book no justice and cut off right when the characters start understanding one another
Feb 28 2015,positive,not as good as the book but hope the next one does
Feb 28 2015,positive,it was really good and the actors grew on you  it is a bit disappointing if you read the books as theres really a lot of the small things that gets missed
Feb 28 2015,negative,i like soundtrack andthats all
Feb 28 2015,negative,while creativity better endowed than its print counter part this is very stupid movie that will come out to be dissatisfying on the big screen its stupid diolouge very illiterate not even slick enough to give no mpre   than  25 stars i gave movie a chance if you guys see this over kings man over the sponge out water movie youll make a huge mistake this movie is not even well acted its  supposed to  be in the romantic genre but it dose not even fit in romantic
Feb 28 2015,negative,best 2 lines of the movie  anastasia christian doors close
Feb 28 2015,positive,not as bad as expected really just a love story but they could have been more subtle with the ending we knew there is going to be movie no 2 there are 3 books after all but finishes really abruptly
Feb 28 2015,negative,fifty shades of a fucked up head yes mr grey you are seriously this movie almost glorifies the wrong attitude towards women as a completely sex object and they are all buying the book and going to the movies what am i missing yes i get sex is good and should be spicy but no   the only good thing about is the soundtrack dakota is cute  and so is the male actor
Feb 28 2015,negative,to be fair the movie is a whole lot better than the book  not that this was a difficult task at its best its the kind of movie you watch with a giddy grin otherwise its obviously bad and actually pretty tame basically the cast is okay dakota johnson does her best jamie dornan is just a pretty face in the end tho hes got the stare but thats about it the two leads have zero chemistry sadly  i liked movieana better than bookana in contrast to the book she comes off a little stronger and wittier in the movie and shes definitely not so annoying thanks to kelly marcel who didnt put any of that hideous monologue in her screenplay  sam taylorjohnson and kelly marcel tried hard with the direction and the screenplay and the result was a movie that is far from being great but not as embarrassing as that badly written book honestly those two women did what they could they saved what could be saved the movie had some funny lines and thankfully it didnt take itself too seriously towards the ending tho it became rather boring and i desperately wanted it to end the ending that was supposed to be dramatic and make viewers cry barely made me feel i felt sorry for the characters unrealistic behavior at the end but since i never really connected with them i never really felt  its certainly not the worst movie ive seen and like i said the first half is actually pretty funny but i still dont get the hype around it i really dont
Feb 28 2015,positive,considering how lousy the book was written and how cheesy the dialogue was i think they actually did a pretty decent job at the movie ana was cute and funny and they didnt make her as lopsided as they did in the book shes and english lit major with a 40 but has trouble working a computer they glossed over christians magical know everywhere she is deal its there but they dont address it much they tried to inject a lot of humor into it its no masterpiece obviously however im going to give it a rating based on its crappy origins and how far they were able to elevate it from that
Feb 28 2015,negative,like a dreadful straight to video film with a high budget
Feb 28 2015,neutral,not the best film ive ever seen but not the worst by a long way the two leads were passable actingwise johnson probably came out ahead which is a shame as i know how good dornan can be i thought certain scenes which were dreadful in the book were quite well handled in the film the contract discussion being one the scriptwriters gave ana some balls she seemed in control throughout she was certainly a long way from the moron in the book the sex scenes were sexy and dornan was beautiful and emotionally unobtainable like hes meant to be i know its not fashionable to say you liked this film but i did and considering the shite mess of a book stw had you work with i thought she did a pretty good job
Feb 28 2015,negative,toothless boring and actually offensive this movie is just a huge cinematic turn off
Feb 28 2015,negative,with the mediocre acting and atrocious dialogue there is only word that can describe this film abysmal
Feb 28 2015,negative,what the hell was that  im disappointed but sort of ok with the abrupt ending due to it being part of a series im even ok with the dominatesubmissive issue everyone seems to be up in arms about due to the simple fact that two legal consenting adults can do whatever they want to each other short of maiming and death and ill even give it an extra star for the steamy sex scenes please dont see this with your parents or kidsor maybe not even a room full of strangers either    what im not ok with is the logic in the story she doesnt understand and even gets mad that he doesnt like to be touched based on he past experiences and even asks him to show her but after he does what she asks of him which she couldve stopped at anytime but didnt she doesnt understand why and gets mad at him for finally showing her and then refused to be touch when he came near her like he should have warned her or somethingoh wait he did throughout the whole first half of the movie    also i didnt care too much for the bits they obviously and crudely cut out of the sex scenes probably to avoid an nc17 rating and save time they could easily have smoothed out those parts better    plus the story so far is not that interesting
Feb 28 2015,negative,fun to watch with some wine terrible otherwise
Feb 27 2015,negative,wouldnt give this movie a single star pointless and a waste of time
Feb 27 2015,positive,first of all i want to say i am a guy and i liked 50 shades of grey  i also minored in psychology in college i tend to find anything that deals with understanding the human condition fascinating i wonder why i  chose trying to understand computers as a career path over people this movie is categorised as a romance but it is a torrid sort i actually liked 50 shades of grey but not for the reasons as how its marketed but for the psychological depth of the two main characters the movie is still running so i will refrain from going into too much detail     the movie is not about sex anyone who comes out of the theatre feeling they got their jollies off seeing some soft porn might be some sick motherfrs the movie is about 2 things abuse of power in relationships and the effects of child abuse  i felt uncomfortable thru the whole movie everything the male protagonist irked me he displayed the same qualities of a psychopath if he wasnt such a philanthropist and oh a billionaire of his own company and apparently the only eligible guy in the city this movie would have more resembled a movie about a stalker on the prowl     but the story is much more than some messed up guy who expresses himself awkwardly through bdsm it is about someone who tries to deal with his own inner issues as a result of suffering abuse in his own childhood through no fault of his own i should add the female protagonist has a face as sweet as an angel but i suspect it will be revealed she has her own personal battles to deal with as well i suspect hers might be on par with christian grey why else would she subject herself to the fd up situation she cant get out of then again we all find ourselves in situations we cant get out of maybe the real moral of the story should be to steer clear of domineering partners and find your equal now i have not read the books nor plan to but i hear there are already sequels in the works to flesh out the rest of the issues these two are going to deal with     this movie is fascinating because it tackles real psychological issues child abuse has a way of manifesting in destructive ways in adulthood i couldnt decide if actor jamie dornan was supposed to intentionally act stilted throughout the movie because of the trauma i certainly did not see the attraction at all hes more of a show off than a person of magnetic gravitas dakota johnson sold me completely and her acting was believable look past the sex the bondage the skin on skin because these are really not the focus     the author hooked us with rope and have now forced us you and me to feel the pain of the main characters a woman emotionally trapped to a real fd up guy and a guy who shouldve gotten therapy unfortunately we are the submissive and they are our dominant why did the author choose bdsm to tell a romancein the world of bdsm it is a negotiation of pain and pleasure appropriation between dominant and submissive whereas in a rape situation there is no negotiation between victim and victimiser no wonder i felt that uneasy feeling throughout the whole movie
Feb 27 2015,negative,i tried to watch ten minutes of it i could not i put my headphones on unplugged and pretended to listen to something else  then all together akin to walking out of a movie theater i switched movies
Feb 27 2015,negative,poor acting and bad ending waste of time and money
Feb 27 2015,negative,the books were a hogwash of insipid dialog and mediocre at best writing  then they make this ode to refuse into a movie i am being kind with a two stars simply because the actors tried hard to fit their rolls but fell short of whatever mark the bookmovie was going for simply it sucked
Feb 27 2015,positive,i went in expecting to hate it and surprisingly enough it wasnt that bad it may be because my expectations were low i knew not to expect great acting a great plot or character development  the sex scenes were surprisingly tasteful and it was overall ok in my opinion the movie is better than the book  words i have never said before
Feb 27 2015,positive,the critics have been pretty harsh with this film so i went in with an open mind and was quite surprised its a pretty good story and actors i give it a 610
Feb 27 2015,positive,an alternate title for this movie could be johnson and dornan make a  porno there was absolutely no reason that this needed to be made but if you are watching it for some cheap thrills you will definitely find something to enjoy
Feb 27 2015,negative,fifty shades of stupid
Feb 27 2015,positive,not bad the storyline was actually interesting considering all the drama over the sm
Feb 27 2015,negative,allow me to perform for you now a magic trick im going to give you two hours of your life back you can thank me later there is an abomination making the rounds under the guise of popular cinema and i think you know the film i mean    50 shades of what the hell did i just watch isnt so much a movie as it is an advertisement for a lifestyle unfortunately the reality of that lifestyle is about five hundred shades away from whats portrayed within the confines of this barely percolating brazenly pandering plotless pointless parboiled ham of a motion picture seeing danny elfmans name in the credits gave me hope but even his titanic talent couldnt save this ship from sinking i think on average i can make it through 68 minutes of any porno before im like thank you goodnight but 4 minutes into this hobbled together catchall lust peddling snoozefest i literally couldnt find the stop button fast enough its a beautiful film if you like your sexism stale and bland    the paper cutouts starring in this new bane of my existence dont even phone in their performances i really feel like theyre trying to intentionally torpedo their own work in the movie emotionless soulless its like watching a snake try to tap dance in the snow huh exactly its like eating biscuits without the gravy you can do it but that dont mean its to be done thanks chris rock now could you please pass the butter    if you really want to dip your fingers into the kinky sexy dirty amazing world of deviant adultism skip this trip through the bustedass looking glass and do some research remember the internet or set yourself up with a fetlife account or better yet come on down to where i work we specialize in perversion
Feb 27 2015,negative,there was no chemistry between the two the movie didnt depict the book at all i know reading a book is very involved and descriptive compared to watching a movie but the movie was all around disappointing felt rushed and uninvolved on all the important parts we can only hope they read the reviews and do something different
Feb 27 2015,negative,couldnt watch it terrible  left after 45 minutes
Feb 27 2015,positive,i enjoyed it i did not however read the 1st book since said the movie would be made i waited so now i have a better picture of ana and christian i am reading the second i liked it im open minded liked the actors playing the part and liked the story line
Feb 27 2015,negative,50 shades of boring
Feb 27 2015,neutral,this movie was just as bad as i thought it would be everyone was laughing even during the more intimate scenes cause they were just that awful why was ana doing all the work i seriously want my money back christian grey was a terrible character in the movie he just seemed like a creep not even christian greylight if there was a real christian grey hed beat that actor up for such a terrible portrayal of him ugh he wasnt even believable
Feb 27 2015,positive,it was alright nothing special
Feb 27 2015,negative,i only gave it half a star because this movie did follow the book that is the only credit i could  the actors were not good looking at all my imagination while reading was the best experience  at least the could have had people who could have put the umph in it
Feb 27 2015,positive,couldve been more better  sexier actors lol
Feb 27 2015,positive,dakota johnson was fabulous at ms steele while jaime dornan did his best he did not fit my minds perception of who mr grey is missed several relevant scenes from the book still enjoyed the movie
Feb 27 2015,positive,watching this movie changed my perspective on things it catches our eyes on our way never seen before truly a wonderful story told through the eyes of a   movie
Feb 27 2015,positive,it was a lot better then i thought it would be but still not as good as the book but still cant wait to see the next one
Feb 27 2015,negative,extremely boring pero have more fun reading the book than watching the movie i think the actors where sucks dakota nothing to do with ana in the book
Feb 27 2015,positive,puts the ringer in the stinger and the parrot gets a graham cracker two thumbs up for the dope
Feb 27 2015,negative,i was so excited to see this movie that i followed social media hype during the actor selection and bought tickets weeks prior to the release   only to be disappointed by lack of chemistry between the actors and poor ending choice  the half star is only because the app wouldnt let me post without rating the movie  i wished i would have waited for it to appear in the redbox
Feb 27 2015,negative,really bad so i am glad i only paid 8 bucks to see the movie  the plot would hint  at getting more interesting and then it would go the opposite  i am glad she left without getting killed  the most interesting parts were the apartment the helicopter ride and the the airplane glider
Feb 27 2015,positive,the actor who played christian grey had portrayed the character absolutely perfect however the actress who played anastasia steele i feel could not get her essence and would have been better with another actress i also feel that the movie was just skipped through and was hard to follow if you have not read the book
Feb 27 2015,positive,i thought it was a decent adaptation of the book or part of it anyway i was very glad to see that they didnt just concentrate on sexual aspect if the story they also really worked on developing the characters and their backstories both actors did a wonderful job playing their parts but i wouldve liked to have seen christian played with a bit more emotion i look forward to the next one
Feb 27 2015,negative,horrible just horrible and i dont blame the actors they only performwork with what is put in front of them and apparently the screen writer never read the book the editor spliced it apart and theres was fluidity to the storyline nor did the store stay true to the book was a great disappointment from the book which all can agree did not have the best writing but the story was pure and true and carried me through all three books  pure disappointment for the movie that was more a lifetime movie special i hope the next two redeem the series but think ill wait for those to go to dvd than to spend that much money on a movie ticket again
Feb 27 2015,negative,i have seen porn videos with better acting and writing
Feb 27 2015,negative,wooden bad acting stale story no characters no chemistry  not even good love scenes for gods sake
Feb 27 2015,negative,ok lets cut short  who havent watch fifty shades of grey yet i got an advise for you instead of downloading and watching this shitty movie and clearly wasting that 2hrs of your time which regretfully i am i suggest you better find a lovely partner and make your own version of fifty shades of grey  i bet ya that would be the best act you guys will ever make     utter bad movie bad direction bad screen writing bad acting even the sex didnt turn me on what can i expect when the book was total crap 
Feb 27 2015,negative,it was just dumb but i havent read any books if that matters
Feb 27 2015,positive,much better than the twilight series story is very interesting  loaded with cool cars fancy apartments and stylish watches wife was happy with itso im happy with it
Feb 27 2015,negative,even this half a star is generous for this film so glad i never spent money to go see it the books are much better stick to them and dont bother with this film
Feb 27 2015,negative,fifty shades of grey is fifty percent shades of disaster this film from the opening to the mid point has one of the worst dialogues ever to be display in film however from the mid point to the the ending it improve slightly to make it an average film in essence this film with almost no chemistry between the lead actor and actress is not a good film to watch just to have a good laugh that they made a film like this
Feb 27 2015,negative,had to see what the fuss was all about i understand the interest but sadly this is just shallow badly acted and a cheesy script
Feb 27 2015,positive,i actually liked it not gonna win an academy award but was fun to watch
Feb 27 2015,positive,absolutely loved this movie it was to tastefully done and so true to the book  cant wait for 2
Feb 27 2015,positive,i read the book a while ago and i really enjoyed this movie maybe not a guys movie but def worth it
Feb 27 2015,negative,absolutely worst box office movie ive seen in years
Feb 27 2015,negative,performances neither good nor bad just regular performances really bad story of domestic violence abuse low self esteem and objectification disguised as a love story
Feb 27 2015,positive,absolutely loved it saw it a bunch of times and going again
Feb 27 2015,negative,this film was just absolutely terrible  it is not worth the money nor is it worth the time  the only time that its worth is how bad it is  i was actually looking forward to viewing this film after reading the trilogy but this was just horrible  it has missed so many important details from the books  i used to admire the work that jamie dornan has done on once upon a time but this was just absolutely terrible  i personally would never recommend this film to anyone
Feb 27 2015,negative,it is finally here the movie every housewife saw opening weekend and every boyfriend was dragged to and i feel sorry for what they had to sit through for two hours for a book that was so highly praised by so many people this film was all kinds of terrible from its plot or lack thereof to its characters and dialogue this movie just failed to deliver in any way now i know i am not the target audience for this film but even if i am not the target audience i have to be able to have at least a half decent time watching it right from the very first anastasia and christian scene this move was just so cringeworthy and a complete borefest this movie did a terrible job of creating and introducing these characters one comes across as a weird overcontrolling freak some words i cannot include here and the other a very confused dumb and poorly written woman whoever wrote the dialogue for this film whether it was the same as the novel or updated for the film needs to retire their writing career because the conversations between the two leads are so boring all the lines seem very fake like this writer has never had a normal human conversation most of this crappy dialogue is the writers fault for writing it but also jamie dornan was just completely bland in this role his delivery of the lines were so robotic and fake that you didnt buy what they were saying for a second i do believe that anastasia did a half decent job while having to portray one of the dumbest characters who is completely incapable of making any kind of rational decision her scenes when she is away from christian are more bearable it is when they are together that it just gets unbearable to watch    now the plot was just so plain and simple that for a whole 2 hours the movie went absolutely nowhere the movie was not building up to any kind of event it was just a series of conversations and sexual activities all spaced out over the two hours whoever read the script and thought that this would be able to capture the viewers attention the whole time was dead wrong this film did its very best to make me fall asleep but i fought it because i had to see what stupidity they would come up with next to keep the film going this film was just filled with many many weird and awkward conversations that just make you wonder why on earth this woman is interested in this man and why this man is so interested in this woman with a bit of unsexy sex thrown in there a few times and one of the worst endings in film history this movie was a disaster waiting to happen if it wasnt for dakota johnson actually making her character at times amusing this would have somehow been even lower  2910
Feb 27 2015,negative,get a lifeto the filmmakers
Feb 27 2015,negative,improve the writing get rid of the current christian and get someone more emotional and not eye candy
Feb 27 2015,negative,lacking on so many levels
Feb 27 2015,negative,havent seen it but i bet there will be a lot of accidental deaths from boring middle aged couples trying to attempt stranglewanking and bdsm related activities to spice up their joyless lives
Feb 27 2015,positive,i havent read the books but i really enjoyed the movie and cant wait 4 the next 1   i am not interested to read the books now to go more indeepth with the characters
Feb 27 2015,negative,just awful more like a daytime soap than a r movie so disappointed
Feb 27 2015,positive,i have not read the book i went to this with an open mind like most blokes i men i went along with the other half however as a movie fan i believe you have to see for yourself    i have to say i found it better than i was expecting  with the review in mind it was watchable and enjoyed it interesting story however i do think speaking to those who have read the book it has been toned down for the mass market i am going to read the book to see for myself    so no its not a massive deal its a good move and i am interest and seeing more i want to know more  if you only see one movie at the moment this is not it however if you want an interesting movie  go see this for yourself
Feb 27 2015,negative,big pile of garbage  if women are really into these books there is something really wrong here now i understand everyone is entitled to his or her opinion but i state mine by saying that this movie was boring  i dont think it was meant to be this boring but the dialogue stoinks the movie fell flat from the beginning to the end  i give this movie an f
Feb 27 2015,negative,fifty shades of shit
Feb 26 2015,positive,it was just like the first book i liked it and dakota was amazing
Feb 26 2015,positive,love it or hate the idea fifty shades of grey is one of the biggest film releases this year strategically placed on a valentines day weekend release the millions and millions of woman who were captivated by the highly successful novel series were lining up around the block to get their first taste of a live action mr grey     fifty shades of grey is basically twilights replacement funnily enough stemming from twilight fan fiction fifty shades follows an awkward young woman who is pursued by an improbable love interest the main difference being that instead of edwards vampirism mr grey sports a bdsm fetish where he must dominate his sexual partner and this was the big draw card to the novel its explicit sex scenes but how would this translate to a modern major motion picture many people were shocked to find the film was rated ma rather than a hard r well i found that the sex scenes were quite tastefully shot and the two leads bonded well together here but i really thought it was going to go a whole lot further the domination scenes were pretty tame i expected it to get pretty brutal but i suppose we gotta leave some room for build up in the sequels     i thought the sexual tension between anastasia and mr grey was great for the most part but then jamie dornan mr grey would do something stupid like bite a piece of toast that anastasia is holding or give a hollow line delivery that just broke any sense of coolness that this character had in fact it is dornans performance that ultimately harms this film he is almost good but on the contrary  dakota johnson who plays anastasia is great as the girl next door type a lot of people seem to have a problem with her but i felt that she played the role strongly and i believed her the whole way     i didnt love this film it is lame lovey dovey and cheesy but thats what i expected it is an interesting enough story that had me for most of the way it does run a tad long though and i wasnt digging the ending much but im sure it will be remedied in the inevitable sequel if you have even the slightest interest in this film you need to go see it in cinemas     35    behind this door is my playroom  mr grey  what like where you keep your xbox and stuff  anastasia
Feb 26 2015,negative,dakota johnson provides a fresh breathe of air but the source material supporting cast and most importantly jamie dornan fail to support her bland acting sluggish pace and laughable dialogues puts fifty shades of grey amongst the worst films of the year so far
Feb 26 2015,negative,that was a pathetic effort in both acting and bdsm wrong cast and boring
Feb 26 2015,negative,122 minutes of my life i wont get back  absolute waste of time
Feb 26 2015,negative,omg whats with all the hype with this movie this movie sucks ass this movie is probably for horny teenagers or single people definitely not for married people  im beyond disappointed my husband and i gave up watching it after 50 minutes into the movie 
Feb 26 2015,positive,it was actually better than i thought it would be i went to watch it with a friend thinking it would be a complete train wreck but it was funny and entertaining
Feb 26 2015,negative,no plot to speak of
Feb 26 2015,positive,i loved the movie it could have been a little more like the book but i hope the next movie is more like the book because the second book is awesome i loved it and the third book is amazing
Feb 26 2015,positive,its a movie that no one wants to admit they enjoyed someone is buying these books and movie tickets  millions of us its like sex for women in the victorian age its only wrong if you like it its very sensual a very intense love story that isnt afraid to address what goes wrong when youre trying to work out your er  sexual preferences the movie is at least an attempt to answer the the dichotomy of why women want equal treatment everywhere but in the bedroom honest wellacted and even heartwrenching two thumbs up why are reviewers so afraid of reality
Feb 26 2015,negative,it was a slow movie that had me wondering why i paid to wacth it
Feb 26 2015,positive,after watching it a second time i think i can give my rating watching just as a film its pretty good but can be very flat in certain scenes i dont think its the lead characters they had chemistry but more the directing that went wrong plus it was missing vital parts of the story and made quite a few changes to scenes compared to the book i understand you cant get a whole book in a movie but certain things should have been included and unfortunately dakota didnt nail the last scene like i expected but in saying that ill be back for the 2nd movie my favourite book just hoping for a different director 
Feb 26 2015,negative,this is a terrible movie and not romantic in any way greg is a sadistic  domineering control freak abusive relationships are not something we should be glorifying
Feb 26 2015,positive,pretty good and unpredictable if you read the book however there are a lot of sexual scenes and being a girl felt slightly disturbed and uncomfortable once the film ended my friends gina felt the same way
Feb 26 2015,negative,without a doubt the worst thing i have ever watched turgid poorly played watered down nonsense
Feb 26 2015,positive,it was ok and good but i heard that the writer did not really help a lot and for the the sequel  the writer is going to help direct it so cant wait 
Feb 26 2015,negative,ha the books were boring and the movie is even more so do not waste your money on either the books or films if you want to get a thrill go watch porn online
Feb 26 2015,negative,for the first half of the movie i was laughing my ass off with some of the worst dialogue i have ever heard spoken by characters as stale as cardboard by the second half i just couldnt take it anymore with the exception of some fantastic cinematography this film is absolute trash
Feb 26 2015,negative,i have not seen it but that movie is just about rape so screw it
Feb 26 2015,positive,lacked lustre  acting was not very good
Feb 26 2015,positive,i would highly recommend the film if you have red the book i am guessing that a lot of the haters have not read the book and therefore can understand their negative comments i thought it was a great film they have portrayed the film really well and i cant wait for the sequel jamie wasnt my mr grey when it was announced but he certainly is becoming my mr grey better dig my kindle out
Feb 26 2015,positive,very uncomfortable  they could have done a lot more hinting
Feb 26 2015,positive,my only question is did all these people picking the movie apart read the books because if they did they wouldnt have i found 2 major flaws with the movie 1 they dumbed down the vocabulary and 2 his skin is suppose to show signs of abuse apart from that i feel it was spot on what most dont realize they are still very young she just graduating college and he a young rich man who is trying to find his way by using what he was taught by a sadistic woman
Feb 26 2015,negative,not like the book 
Feb 26 2015,positive,people are bashing this and havent seen it all i can say is go into it with an open mind it was good acting and it is a love story yes there is sex in it but there is so much more than sex to this movie i never wanted to see it but glad i did now because it was worth it
Feb 26 2015,positive,excellent sexy and true to the book cant wait for the next
Feb 26 2015,positive,its just like the book
Feb 26 2015,negative,by ricky miller       fifty shades of grey   much ado about nothing    fifty shades of grey is an is an overblown melodrama that is on par with director paul verhoevens showgirls for degree of awfulness  dakota johnson tvs ben and kate is the naããâve young girl who gets seduced into the world of masochist christian grey jamie dornan marie antoinette      going back to the  days of my youth i actually read the books before   i saw the movie i did this with stephen kings misery and tom clancys the hunt for red october      both were great movies but the reason rested in the directors hands  the reason both of the movies were so good rested in the resulting flicks done by rob reiner and john mctiernan  reiner steered kathy bates to an oscar win for misery while mctiernan introduced a star in the making with alec baldwin             nowadays i think the movie should stand alone without having read the book             with this in mind i did not resort to reading the pages of el jamess  page turners   both screenwriters james who also penned the novel its based on  and kelly marcel add nothing of any merit to the superficial and trite dialogue            another predicament with fifty shades is one does not care in the very least about these selfish lovebirds  sure it might have been steamy and tantalizing on the page but director sam taylorjohnson never pulls one into the proceedings and their earthquaking romance  dornans selfish persona of christian grey is just that of a spoiled yahoo who does not really care for others but just his own gluttonous selfish appetite  johnsons anastasia steele is seduced by grey and all his shortcomings               adding to the credibility of the movie is the appearance of oscarwinner marcia gay harden as christians psychologist mom dr grace travelyan grey  her appearance although brief shows how unimportant christian is to the very scheme of things in real life  her persona is not one of ignorance but of a person who is just prone to look the other way    looking back at socalled controversial movies of my youth like 9 12 weeks zalman kings two moon junction and wild orchid i think of how ludicrous it was to deem these movies controversial  they are just bloody movies and nothing more  controversy aside i just want to see a good movie paul thomas andersons boogie nights was one of the better movies i have seen in the past 20 years  the same goes for michael manns copsandrobbers tale heat wherein an aged robert deniro and al pacino square off in a pretzeltwisting suspense actionthriller   that is what i want in my movie  quality  its not asking for much but that is what i want to spend my money on   fifty shades of grey for all intents and purposes is a complete waste of time  johnsons  anastasia is a woman who realizes all too late that there is more to life than the simple pleasure of appealing to ones loins  real life is far too important  grade  c
Feb 26 2015,negative,its like porn for kids with a cheesy story lol i wish i could give it a lower rate but this app wont let me
Feb 26 2015,positive,thought they did a great job keeping it like the book and showing the true awkwardness of the two characters loved it 
Feb 26 2015,negative,totally shallow film consisting of a narrow no depth 2 characters with just bare breasts early on and the same repeated throughout the film  boring for the viewer who likes mindless supposedly titillating which its not even that
Feb 26 2015,negative,big als movie review  fifty shades of grey    college student anastasia steele is introduced into the bdsm lifestyle after a chance meeting with christian grey a billionaire businessman with a twisted past     this film was a laughable mistake     to be fair the novel that its based on is just guiltypleasure fun filled with the old goodgirlsaveschangesbroodingbutbeautifulbillionairebadboy fantasy but what a readers minds eye will forgive from a subpar novel a movie audience members real eyes and ears will not sure the script was weak the miscasted actors couldnt act and the much anticipated sex scenes seemed tame but i mean at least the soundtrack was decent     grade  d    big al says fifty shades of grey is a renterbut only if you want to hatewatch
Feb 26 2015,negative,as seen on castle rock news by deke the movie geek    whos it for fans of cheesy romance novels the marquis de sade the lifetime network movies so bad they make you laugh out loud at times unintended by the filmmakers to be funny much to the horror of fellow moviegoers    50 shades of grey is based upon an el james novel that actually does hit upon some deep human issues  though unfortunately it does not have the ability to penetrate beneath some of the complexities it scratches upon at the core of the film is the deep human desire to compensate for deep physical emotional and mental trauma the protagonists delve into the world of sadomasochism because that represents to mr grey a device of controlling his environment and the response of others especially the one he allows to be closest to him    there is essentially a great deal of disappointment in a human attempting to micromanage their world and those around him a great fail in the area of relating to another this leads to the conclusion that in our mutual yearning for fellowship and intimacy that no amount of deviancy could ever satisfy or fulfill anyone its too bad this potentially great topic was put in the hands of filmmakers that chose to focus on sensationalism of sensuality    it is funny that the film shot in an ironic 9  12 weeks and it shows that the cast took only 5 days to learn their dialogue the movie has also been banned in kenya for moral reasons and perhaps should have been in the united states for artistic reasons ironically the seahawks won their first super bowl during filming but the choices made by the filmmakers amounted cinematically to not handing off to marshawn lynch in the last superbowl a bad call to make this film on their part the film has enjoyed the commercial success of its shallow fluffy book franchise its based upon thus we can sadly expect more of the same in future poorly made cinema lacking any real substance
Feb 26 2015,negative,very poor ending some intense scenes but not that greatand she had no car at the end 
Feb 26 2015,positive,my experience was one of annoyance because people actually quoted lines from the book i would definitely have to see it againoverall the movie was good it did the book justice im looking forward to a sequel because the ending left me hanging 
Feb 26 2015,neutral,its the next line of twilight they are in seattle he young with boat loads of money   he was taught dominant and submissive as a 14 year old from a mrs robinson     is a sexy provocative movie  no its worth seeing but its pretty low key on the sex and its very predictable     id wait for 1 redbox when all the movies  are out 
Feb 26 2015,positive,i seen it yesterday and loved it i read all of the book jaime did a great job and couldnt see charlie hunnam in that role cant wait to see the next movie love dakota johnson
Feb 26 2015,negative,cheesy and rather cringey laughable in places that are not meant to be funny the single most over hyped film of the century
Feb 26 2015,positive,i actually loved the movie
Feb 26 2015,positive,50 shades is something else when it comes to defining a good film having beeen a fan of the books i expected quite a lot from this movie i was to be slightly disappointed in this expectation as a lot of the juicer seens from the book were edited or taken out this film lacked emotion and made anna look like a withered shell of a girl in the book she has more of a personality shes witty sarcastic and doesnt settle without a fight and mr grey harbours more anger and pain that the film even attempts to portray however i can not say that the film was bad as such the more explicit scenes were captured perfectly  without revealing too much and the actors playing the supporting roles their parents for example played those roles extremely well i may not think that this film lived up to the book or the hype created around but i will be buying the dvd and watching the rest of the series on the big screen as i know there is a lot more to be offered from this series
Feb 26 2015,neutral,this is like 2 shades of softcore porn and 48 shades of ana putting a pencil in her mouth and biting her lips they have some pretty witty lines though i will still watch 50 shades darker itz a better 3 story than twilight
Feb 26 2015,negative,weak script interesting story and solid performers considering not enough plot though or broad enough characterisation
Feb 26 2015,positive,despite what the roses says i thought this was a good movie  an erotic love story that is the 9 12 weeks of the new millennium
Feb 26 2015,negative,a travesty in film making a bland poorly paced and structured movie with no redeeming qualities except dakota johnson who seemed to be in on her own joke throughout
Feb 26 2015,negative,im now expecting walmart to start selling bondage gear  is it ever ok if some things we do sexually can not be mainstreamed  im not religious nor a prude but seriously can we allow some things to remain a curiosity that we explore with our partner in private and not at the local megaplex  knowing my middle aged neighbors in my middle class subdivision are acting out this kind of thing makes me throw up   underground is way coolercan we leave some activities there  second the movie was so badly acted and silly i was embarrassed i was wishing i had someone to poke my eyeballs with shrimp forks  im still embarrassed and think the women that go and giggle and act like idiots do all of us women who would like to maintain some dignity  an injustice  its really sucking to be a female right now
Feb 26 2015,positive,could of added more to the film from the book
Feb 26 2015,negative,i did watch this one at the cinema a bit long drawn out one or two people left the cinema before the end has its moments
Feb 25 2015,neutral,i was expecting far worse ive read the original story twilight au and the adapted versions although it was odd to see everything so vividly on display i do think that the movie followed closely to the characters of the book personally i think jamie dornan surprised me with how well he played the roll of christian above all it was definitely not the worst movie ive seen
Feb 25 2015,negative,this is an awful movie absolutely terrible the storyline is too slow and then it jumps around is hard to follow only reason it didnt get 0 stars is because the male lead is fantastically gorgeous dont waste your money
Feb 25 2015,positive,awesome feel good movie  both my hubby and i enjoyed it and finally sensuality romance sex watching 50 shades with a theater compromised of many single women watching and gabbing  lol
Feb 25 2015,negative,fifty shades of wasted time boring
Feb 25 2015,positive,both my husband and i enjoyed the movie and didnt read the novels  the people that complained and gave bad reviews should have brought their mates instead of friends  the sensuality and sex scenes were a nice treat  the acting was pretty good too  looking forward to the sequel
Feb 25 2015,positive,if you didnt read the books youre not going to appreciate the movie the movie was the book just without all the bad grammar and stupid writing both actors definitely played the part well and were not disappointing in the least i look forward to the next one and look forward to seeing how jamie plays the more unguarded version of christian
Feb 25 2015,positive,i can not wait for the next movie in this series sooooo great
Feb 25 2015,negative,i would never see this i hate absolutely everything this film endorses
Feb 25 2015,positive,book was better but they did give a good effortfor a soft porn
Feb 25 2015,positive,i definitely did not feel that the role of christian grey was properly cast i just didnt feel like that was the character i imagined from the book at all
Feb 25 2015,positive,first of all the movie was spectacular jamies acting was very impressive despite what critics say second of all people should try to be open minded about the story and thirdly im looking forward to the next sequel
Feb 25 2015,positive,ok but ill wait till the next one is on vudu
Feb 25 2015,negative,domestic violence rape and abuse covered in chocolate and presented as erotica this is twilight which was too stupid for words but targetted towards teenage girls ratcheted up for adults with no critical thinking
Feb 25 2015,positive,awkward dialogue and no heat between them
Feb 25 2015,negative,bad acting too weird for me
Feb 25 2015,positive,jamie dornan is hot but every time he slipped into hes real accent i found myself thinking yes the score was so boring and seeing the book played out just made it all so awkward yes he is a deranged sociopath and you should run i found dakota johnson adorable and funny i wasnt expecting that  she came across more adventurous than naivebut man it could have been steamy and it was just fifty shades of meh
Feb 25 2015,negative,quite possibly the worst film i have ever seen the dialoguescript is almost as badly written as the book the acting is wooden and there is a complete lack of chemistry between the actors dreadful avoid at all costs
Feb 25 2015,positive,a male aged 36 went to watch with my wife and thought it was fantastic and want to go cinema again plus will be purchasing on blueray when out
Feb 25 2015,positive,screen writers did a great job  so much better than the book very well cast
Feb 25 2015,positive,i personally really liked the movie  the story is a really messed up love story and im a sucker for a love story so of course i was going to like it    dakota johnson did an amazing job portraying anastasia steele i originally thought she looked too oldexperienced but on screen she was brilliant at playing the shy inexperienced and average anastasia    i like jamie dornan as christian grey although i think he needs to be taller  the film does make christian grey seem nicer and not so intimidating but i think that just added to the story    this is the first film and book and we all know that was the boring book it took me a while to get into it  i think and hope the next film will be even better
Feb 25 2015,neutral,the 21st century pretty woman only its not as good and theres no richard gere although dakota johnson has the julia roberts potential
Feb 25 2015,negative,total waste of time  it was so boring this shouldnt have been a movie at all  soap opera would be a better fit for the dull plot there was even nothing sexy about it  i was feeling bad for the poor girl the whole time
Feb 25 2015,negative,should be zero stars  not as bad as i had braced myself for but not good in fact i think the word that best describes this film is dull which given the topic one would think that could be avoided nope ill say this its well shot as for the rest ugh the dialog between most of the characters sounds like its out of a piece of fan fiction i never understood what the two saw in each other beyond the physical and the only passion between the two was that conveyed by the camera even the much talked about bdsm elements were incredibly tame i was mostly left wondering what the hype was about both pro and con then it just ended its not even a complete story it didnt even reach any kind of climax you know what i mean it just stopped i thought the ending to the maze runner was bad up until then while i didnt like it i might have been more favorable but with that ending im just left wondering what the point of the whole endeavor is its too tame to be either offensive or arousing it just left me feeling nothing which is nearly the worst thing a film can do
Feb 25 2015,negative,the only good thing about this movie was dakota johnson
Feb 25 2015,positive,love it  wasnt sure how this film would turn out but thought it was great not as graphic as the book so dont worry cant wait for the next film
Feb 25 2015,negative,i was very disappointed in this movie the casting was all wrong and there was no connecting to the characters the book was great but this movie did not do the book any justice needless to say i will not be going back to the movies to see any sequels
Feb 25 2015,negative,more like 50 shades of complete crap horrible plot horrible acting i knew in the first 10 minutes i was in for a 2 hour snooze fest worst movie i have seen in about 7 years
Feb 24 2015,negative,not worth the money very bad let down from what it couldve been the actor and actress should not of played in that movie it should have been more than what they made very disappointing if they come out with part 2 and 3 i definitely wont go to watch it
Feb 24 2015,negative,sam taylorjohnsons adaptation of fifty shades of grey puts emphasis on the grey  the color grey as in bland    for a 2 hour story surrounding kinky sex there is very little in the way of arousing excitement  the story is thin and it never seems to be heading in a forward direction  integral plot details are far and few in between leaving the sex to stand out    on the subject of sex there are a number of erotic scenes with a bunch of buildup for them  to associate with the rrating these scenes never fully engulf what makes the fifty shades of grey what its meant to be  possible pushing to the nc17 rating is what is needed    dakota johnson and jamie dornan are attractive in their own right but viewing their performances is very tiring  maybe the characters are meant to be this way but its easier to read then view on screen    fifty shades of grey does have a few moments and only a few  easily passable
Feb 24 2015,positive,i thought it was very intense
Feb 24 2015,negative,i meanat least the soundtrack is excellent
Feb 24 2015,positive,i love love love love the books unfortunately i didnt love the movie so much  a lot of main details where left out and the sex parts where good but i would prefer a lot of more of the key details of who christian grey is and anastasia steel overall the movie was okay  still had me excited and thrill cant wait for the next two movies to came out
Feb 24 2015,neutral,not nearly as bad as i expected it to be perhaps i am just happy because it is a movie for girls that is somewhat unique the movie is deeply flawed but not in any traditional boring way
Feb 24 2015,positive,acting was good and anatasa played the part very well  rating it 5 star due to the sensuality was well played    not sure why critics are sabotaging this movie maybe a new romance is warranted
Feb 24 2015,positive,i liked the delicate adaptation of the director and the performance of the principal actors more believable and relatable than the book
Feb 24 2015,positive,i really think people were harsh about on this movie i think it is one of the best book to movies in a long time if im looking at it from book to movie they stayed true to the book the sex get the hell over it people we all do it the stuff you see in this movie isnt much more than you see on hbo or showtime i think the sex was very tasteful and not over done another huge word for ya consent this movie in no way is rape cut that shit out now its crap they are consenting adults she consents to everything and he doesnt make her do anything she want to do overall i think this was a good movie i enjoyed it i thought it was sexy and i thought dakota was funny and sassy leaving out the inner goddess that was found sometimes very annoying in the books it follows the books timeline oh and please stop comparing this to twilight yes it was twilight fan fiction and there are similarities but this is not twilight dont judge something if you dont know what you are talking about
Feb 24 2015,negative,fifty shades of meh   like watching two people drown in gasoline without a single spark
Feb 24 2015,positive,if you enjoyed the books youll enjoy the movie
Feb 24 2015,negative,every now and then a special film comes along the kind of film that defies all expectations and completely angers and disappoints you all at the same time this is the best way to describe the failure known as fifty shades of grey this is hands down one of the worst films i have ever seen not because of how controversial the subject matter is but by the sheer failure of every aspect a movie should succeed in first things first i have not read the books i saw this as someone who knew only minimal details about what this was about i honestly have no idea how to go about this review i normally start with the good then work my way down to the bad but here this is a colossal failure on every front the main issue here is the writing with the script being penned by kelly marcel marcels script is hands down one of the worst that has ever been written for a film every single line is so laughable and single handedly stupid you find yourself laughing in even the more serious parts word after word you grow more bored and  by the end of the film you simply do not care about anyone or anything that happened the characters are one dimensional and the romance is so rushed that you cant believe any of it not only that but the entire character of christian grey is nothing short of a sex offender and no matter how they try to dress him up there is just an unnerving air that isnt sexy but rather sad because he should honestly be in jail for his actions he is just that unlikable here the ending of the film is just a cheap way to set up a sequel and is nothing short of a sin to be so blatant and tasteless adding to this conundrum is the acting in the film jamie dornan and dakota johnson star and they dieliver some of the worst acting i have ever seen dornan plays christian grey a man with particular interests and a shady past dornan is beyond dreadful making his already silly lines even more ludicrous and you simply cant believe he is into the things he is johnson plays anastasia steele and she atleast tries to make this work but she is simply not capable of doing so her delivery is off way too childish and too passive when it comes to the dramatic scenes making this a stretch for anyone to even believe director sam taylorjohnson helmed this and she drops the ball in every single scene all her films have a style that only she can deliver but here she tries to establish a style early on but instead she just abandons it and it comes to the point where you can tell they are on a sound stage and not in seattle most shockingly taylorjohnson failed in the controversial sex scenes they arent racy or even shocking they are just as laughable as the script and the acting so basically this film even failed on the one thing the fan base is expecting  all in all i loathed every living second of fifty shades of grey this could have been a sleek and different kind of thriller but instead strives to be a subpar melodrama everything is so poorly done this is a chore to sit through this is not only one of the worst of the year so far but by far one of the worst films ever made skip this piece of filth and never look back
Feb 24 2015,positive,the movie was a good adaptation of the book all the fuss over the sex was crazy you see more boobs and butt on late night cable dakota johnson gave a strong performance  but there was no on screen chemistry with jamie dornan the soundtrack is worth a purchase
Feb 24 2015,positive,it was ok it had surprisingly good humor the cast just didnt meet my expectations it did a great job following the book
Feb 24 2015,negative,if you like this movie then i feel bad for you
Feb 24 2015,negative,boring jamie dornan not good looking enough certainly wouldnt make me go week in the knees at first glance dakota johnson more believable but the biting the lip thing got on my nerves and just seemed laughable cant see what all the fuss is about my advice dont bother
Feb 24 2015,positive,i read all 3 books and i actually liked the movie a lot
Feb 24 2015,positive,interestingly not provocative
Feb 24 2015,neutral,i went in with low expectations so it was entertaining overall
Feb 24 2015,negative,hi why you make a movie like thatskip all the good detail and the actor act like a robort  even a director and a screen writer no good  please make another one i had being waiting so long for this sorry for the money i paid should give me back the money i love the story not the bad company do very bad job sorry
Feb 24 2015,positive,unlike any of the other viewers and circling negativity i enjoyed the movie if you didnt enjoy it take your imagery somewhere else and make your own movie besides that i think it was quite entertaining sensual ideas were obviously brought to this movie and i didnt see an issue with it at all worth the money and for some locals around my area 6 tuesday movie admissions in annapolis so i dont want to hear it wasnt worth the money its cheaper than your dinner
Feb 24 2015,positive,so i have read all 3 of the books and i loved them i was very excited to see the movie however when i saw this movie i was very very upset because it left out almost the whole book honestly it felt like just an extended trailer not a movie very disappointed
Feb 24 2015,negative,he is only sexy to women because of his money  if he had lived in a trailer park and not been a billionaire this would be an episode of criminal minds
Feb 24 2015,positive,i wish they have more characters in the movie i think the movie is very much alike with the book i am grateful that they were able to do the best to show whats on the book unlike other movies the skills of making the movie is amazing i wish more stars would consider roles for the next one i know for sure that it has its potential because it is a great love story
Feb 24 2015,positive,loved every second of this movie completely in love with the characters could not have asked for a better fifty shades excited beyond belief to see the next two continue this incredibly amazing sexy romance
Feb 24 2015,positive,the acting wasnt the best in the beginning but it eventually became decent towards the end the chemistry was a little awkward between the two but maybe in the sequel it will get worked out it wasnt what i was expecting but it was not awful i recommend seeing it
Feb 24 2015,negative,rating 2 out 5 an erotic romantic story without the erotic romance or story     i went and saw the film that was meant to please every womans fantasy 50 shades of grey     to start off this movie wasnt porn soft porn or even moderately a romantic movie     the actors were dull and the actor playing christian grey had the charisma of a wombat sorry wombats    from what i have been told by people who have read the book his charisma was meant to make the woman drool and swoon for him if this is the case then women have a very low benchmark to be turned on     as for the comments of him being a creepy rapist well while i can see where they are coming from i wouldnt go that far to call the movie anything like that     i think the issue here was the book made out that this story was about the work possible sexual pleasure one could experience only to see it on the screen of her getting tied up with a feather     if you want to see a home  away version of the book then this is the movie for you
Feb 24 2015,negative,worst movie ever to be made based on the worst book ive ever partly read do not watch this dont give them money they might make another one like it
Feb 24 2015,negative,vapid and frigid where it should be sexy and erotic instead this adaptation just comes of uninteresting and very comedic chemistry between the two actors and not much happens plotwise to get us riled up about the erotica not to mention that christian grey and anna are perhaps some of the dullest characters ever created then again why complain when the source material was never really good to begin with
Feb 23 2015,negative,smfhwackasfuck holyshitballs
Feb 23 2015,positive,very sexy movie but failed to climax
Feb 23 2015,positive,loved the movie fantastic acting  i cant see why everyone is up in arms of this movie  there has been far worse r rated movie before this one but its seems most critics didnt give a good rating so for now i wont ever listen to a film critic and work out my own rating
Feb 23 2015,positive,i loved it it followed the book almost to a tee a few cheesy lines here and there i dont ribbon any other actor could play christian and anastasia like jamie dornan and dakota johnson im definitely looking forward to fifty shades darker
Feb 23 2015,positive,its been years since pretty woman showed that even a prostitute can live the dream i began to read the books and they bored me to a point i couldnt finish however i thought this movie was fine as i watched the movie i wondered how much easier relationships would be if people were to put everything on the table immediately this is what he wants this is what she wants i digress this isnt for every chick to be a chickflick yet maybe it should be some celebrity said this movie endorses physical abuse blah blah i find that this film endorses the importance of having 2 consenting adults
Feb 23 2015,negative,yet another example of the horrible sterilization plaguing modern media just to sell more tickets
Feb 23 2015,negative,the movie should be marketed for what it is a timid rape fantasy because its nowhere near being a bdsm romance
Feb 23 2015,positive,didnt read the books until after the movie 18 of us went to watch the movie and 17 of us are ready for the next
Feb 23 2015,negative,this film had nothing going for it the writing sounded corny i couldnt understand why she would fall for christian other than he was wealthy he was very possive stalker he only wanted as a sex slave which brings me to the next reason i dislike the movie the sex seemed staged there was no chemestry between the two actors at all and lastly i understand the female character is suppose to be plain but i feel like i the bangs had a bigger role in the movie than her
Feb 23 2015,positive,better then reviews critics are always socritical
Feb 23 2015,positive,i enjoyed the movie
Feb 23 2015,positive,i read the books i couldnt wait for the movie and it was great i also love that it ended so you can expect a part 2 
Feb 23 2015,positive,dopey but never dull 50 shades of grey is way too somber for its own good why are these films always so serious shouldnt sm be fun or mean and nasty something luckily saw this in spanish in mexico city which made it far more entertaining than it should be dakota johnson is pretty damn good though question why does each generation need a story like this from story of o to 9 12 weeks to 50 sombras de grey why inquiring minds want to know
Feb 23 2015,negative,i did not really understand what the movie tries to say and i got bored in cinema after 20 mins watching actually nothing
Feb 23 2015,positive,this is the one movie where its better to have read the books before seeing it grab your girlfriends guys dont get it have a few cocktails before going and relax and let yourself go no award winner but it is true to the book and fun if you dont take it too seriously isnt that what movies are for a fun escape into a fantasy world
Feb 23 2015,negative,dakota did a good job although she consistently overachieved her orgasms before the scenes even began but the movie in itself was far from enjoyable the most deplorable fact was that the director heavily relied on you to know the inner monologue of anastasia steel and assumed we would all twilight the movie and ignore the inept acting of dornan i would lay like a fish under him for all the sex appeal he brought on the director assumed we would love grey so much we would get tingly regardless of the double cleft lip smolder or the oversized infected zits for scars he brought with him to the scenes lets not forget the over achieving soundtrack that was absolutely butchered by having songs in the completely wrong places  i thought a 4 year old was swiping through spotify while his babysitter was watching days of our lives were their bodies hot yes  1 star hmmm maybe deduct half a star because dakota didnt shave her legs and every scene was back lit with an inch of hair tentacling like an anemone grasping for its prey was it fairly in line with the book although lacking all degree of on screen character development chemistry and progression  yes 1 star that leaves us with 15 stars heres to hoping the director is axed a coach is brought in and round 2 is better id rather watch paris hiltons tape then endure another round of that chem class
Feb 23 2015,negative,just read the book skip the flick
Feb 23 2015,negative,one of the worst fucking movies i have ever seen i expected sex and got twilight this was worse than twilight or any of that crap related to it as it was filled with teeniebopper like plot  f  plotthere was none literally zero  d  actingdid they just pick these people up off the street the most wooden acting i have ever seen in a film ive also seen more chemistry between a israel and palestine than i did between these two  d  directingive never seen more boring shots in a film all it was was the most redundant 12mastercoverage shooting in the history of cinema even the shots over the city lacked any artistry every shot was boring and maybe partially due to the fact that they couldnt edit anything together because of the horrible actingsee above and the sex scenes were horribly thought out and the film itself focused on sex had zero sex appeal  c  cinematographyi expected bad story bad acting but also expected it to look fantastic the sex scenes were shit they looked boring and anticlimactic you couldve done so much with this and instead it looked like they just used a basic 3 point light set up routine  c  production designit was whatever had some moments lost my interest in others i unfortunately was too busy hating everything else to remember much of the pd  f  screenplayit was absolute shit with nothing to bring the characters chemistry together   this film was absolute crap i put catwoman and battle field earth above this oneand that is saying something
Feb 23 2015,positive,exactly what i expected i mean how much sex can you put in a film without calling it porn it was tastefully done i felt myself getting goose bumps at times through the romance and the way it was put together i loved the books and would say they are better but like any film based on a book you cant include everything and make it exactly the same because it would go on forever tbh wouldnt have cared myself but ho hum ive seen in twice and already planning number 3 d
Feb 23 2015,negative,fifty shades of nonsense   awful casting terrible adaptation
Feb 23 2015,negative,horrible they actors had no chemistry i did not agree with who they picked to play the characters and now i know whythe movie was down right boring
Feb 23 2015,positive,good moviebut of course the books were wayyyy better d
Feb 23 2015,negative,50 shades of gray a movie that got overhyped for women this movie is twilight without action the sex in this movie is overhyped it isnt brutal and it isnt interesting in places this movie drags on and on and on especially at the end i was hoping for something at least interesting in this movie but nothing occurred christian gray and anastasia are both crazy shes a virgin but since hes so hot shell let him do whatever he wants to her now we do have a contract to sign about what he canning cant do you but thats just nothing really important the two actors had no chemistry together and i feel theyre acting was very bland i counted the time dakota johnson bit her lip in this movie 21 times she bit her lip if you dont believe me come yourself the fact that this movie already has the next two books confirmed really irritates me because its just taking a movie space for other good movies in the end if you want to watch it dont if youre like me and got dragged to it by your girlfriend then youre screwed have fun gents
Feb 23 2015,negative,not very good  christian not good for role either
Feb 23 2015,positive,it followed the book to a tee
Feb 23 2015,negative,the movie did not portray what the book was about  it glazed over it like a brush stroke the role played in this move or anastasia was poor and she came across like a whiny brat and he was not at all convincing as a dom but a man that was using his money to get in her pants
Feb 23 2015,negative,this wasnt great if anything i was bored
Feb 23 2015,negative,it was an interesting concept but portrayed in a very demeaning manner it showed off women as being very easily manipulated and naive the movie is left off at a cliffhanger but judging by the nature of johnsons character what will happen next is quite predictable
Feb 23 2015,positive,definitely deserves better ratings the actor was incredibly hot and movie was very unique lots of nude scenes
Feb 23 2015,negative,not awful but far from good didnt like the characters they were both rather boring she was a wallflower and a total lettice leaf he pig ignorant selfish bit of a gooseberry weird and deff a sandwich short of a picnic no i wont be seeing the sequel save your money go and see something more entertaining and thrilling like american sniper 
Feb 23 2015,negative,i read the book and was curious to see how it would be on screen and its a pretty faithful adaptation of the book but when the source material is shitty a faithful adaptation will result in a shitty film which happened here the dialogue is bad the character of anastasia is an annoying wishy washy twat christian is just an unreal ideal god of a man who really isnt that likable but the biggest sin is that isnt that kinky or graphic as it claims to be they mainly just have regular sex and the few times a whip or other tool is introduced its super tame even in the big climax pun very intended plus you dont see anything below the belt on either of them so thats a letdown as well p more like 50 shades of meh
Feb 23 2015,negative,not what i expected at all i was not impressed by the characters chemistry and i thought the build up of their relationship was not believable christian grey could have been cast better  way better i thought his acting was terrible and ana did a decent job
Feb 23 2015,positive,would like to see more of the little things in second movie the beginning and end of emails  the small box things that makes the book her personality  loved the movie wished it would have showed her interview with jack  please go by the 50 shades darker  dont leave out the small things that made the book
Feb 23 2015,negative,fifty shades of grey had every right to make a splash on the big screen unfortunately the film ends up being a whimper while it is based on a mediocre book about mediocre things it could have been a lot more than what it was i firmly believe they could have made fifty shades of grey nc17 and it would have made just as much money and would have gotten a movie that at least lived up to the book instead we get a very boring over hyped film that tries to be edgy
Feb 23 2015,positive,1010 wish i could get tied like that 
Feb 23 2015,neutral,surprised at dakota johnsons performance  she was funny and spunky when called for  movie was better than i was led to believe thought i found some of the bdsm whipping tragic
Feb 23 2015,negative,who let this film exist every moment of this disaster is a disaster big fat ass spider was better directed written and acted controversy is not only important thing in contoversial movie two thumbs down
Feb 23 2015,positive,a great film really tastefully done
Feb 23 2015,positive,i will be dreaming about mr grey from months on in the story mouth drooling and heart melting i instantly fell in love with the concept reading the book 499 ibooks for the trilogy 1499
Feb 23 2015,positive,whatever jokers rated this 1 star need their heads tested i thought it was great
Feb 23 2015,positive,it had everything you expect of a romantic movie
Feb 23 2015,neutral,despite being occasionally entertaining as a trashy erotic thriller fifty shades of greys thin plot shallow characters terrible dialogue and mediocre acting dampen the experience the similarities to twilight are remarkable except the explicit sex scenes obviously and after reading that this was originally fan fiction of twilight everything made complete sense the relationship is not a healthy one at all much like twilight and the plot is thin at best the excessive length of the film at over 2 hours was too much for what little plot there was nothing substantial happens in the second hour until the end when they end it on a cliffhanger for the next film if you are a fan of the book im sure you will come away satisfied but everyone else should skip unless they want to enjoy it as a trash romance
Feb 23 2015,neutral,perhaps banal is the word that better describes fifty shades of grey i found jamie dornan and dakota johnsons acting not so boring but i found their lines shabby and even not funny at all i didnt watch the movie in a feminist mood i was not there to criticize every single scene but jesus it was even hard not to laugh at the stupidity of some parts sex scenes were not that bad even though many bdsms culture peculiarities were unexplained or worse incorrectly shown last but not least of course the ending is terrible the elevator scene where both the two protagonists call their name recalling their first kiss sequence is vapid totally flat it gives nothing more to the story im sorry i was really well intentioned when i went to the theater last week but i was deeply disappointed by this movie m
Feb 23 2015,positive,i dont understand whats wrong with people if you read the books you should have liked the movie important pivotal moments were there the sex scenes missing werent needed the story is about a man being given love and learning that he deserves the love he is given from people in the end he still has some sexy fun in a healthy way
Feb 23 2015,negative,not a very good movie because of what the guy does to the girl thats not the way to have fun sex
Feb 23 2015,negative,ditzy girl falls for billionaire playboy whos into sadistic sex boring plot and predicable results  surprising the movie has as much decent press as it does  not worth seeing
Feb 23 2015,negative,i await the honest trailer as no doubt they will rip it to shreds just like they did with the twilight franchise filled with boring acting terrible dialogue that obviously didnt make it past the first draft and brief sex scenes that arent sexy or erotically charged in the slightest i know this is called fifty shades of grey but that doesnt mean it has to be translated to the cinematography aswel everything looks so depressing the only thing that saved this was the bursts of ellie gouldings hit single and beyoncés reworked versions of haunted and crazy in love being played over the spanking scenes if you want to be stimulated do not watch this trash and if you do make sure you are drunk just so you can laugh at it
Feb 23 2015,positive,i didnt want to like it but it was pretty good
Feb 23 2015,positive,brilliant very tastefully made the characters are brilliant
Feb 23 2015,positive,i thought it was very close to the book i enjoyed it very much you can only do so much on the big screen i think people wanted more
Feb 23 2015,negative,dont waste your money on a ticket just stick to reading the book this book does not translate well onto the big screen too much of the story takes places in anas head which you dont feel that on the screen
Feb 23 2015,neutral,show kinda dragged on a bit by the end and almost tried a little to hard to be risque at some points but comes across more bland instead mr grey was excellent  anastasia a little cheesey sumtimes apparently shes like that in the book too but i wouldnt know since i havent read it good movie for date night ã anyways
Feb 23 2015,negative,this was an incredibly awful movie the acting was terrible and it left out a decent amount of the story it was painful to watch
Feb 22 2015,positive,it seemed different to me comparing it to the book
Feb 22 2015,negative,fifty shades of grey colored stuff cause theres really not a lot of nuance and that rich grey guy himself has problems that we dont really care about and the director ends up trying to mainstream the hell out of this film with an early 2000s soapymadefortv flair but still cover your eyes kids pardon my streamofconsciousness on a side note the helicopter rides were wicked
Feb 22 2015,positive,not too healthy and happy ending
Feb 22 2015,positive,i totally enjoyed 50 shades  i went in to the movie not focused on the sex of the moviebook but focused on the psychology of the characters  yes if you want to see steamy sex and that is all that you want from this movie then you will be sorely disappointed  if however you want to think about what is going on in the mind of the characters then you will enjoy this movie
Feb 22 2015,negative,the perhaps only literacy value of the movie is its examination of what we as a society could tolerate and accept as it depicts an exploration of a virgin college graduates limit on sexual relationship    an analogy of the storyline is that a woman fell in love with a homosexual man who allowed a sexual relationship to develop via performing penetrative vaginal sex with her yet only would derive pleasure from having sex with man its only after witnessing a receptive anal sex the man had with another man that the woman decided that there was a complete gayness in this man that she should leave the sexual relationship    oh well its no longer politically correct to have gays  appearing ashamed of the way they are or describing themselves as 50 shades of fuckedup and so we have a mr grey who is a bdsm kind of guy or can it be within legal boundary a pedophile or the like ie a more extreme hardtotolerate given illegal type    and please dont confuse sex with love my fellow audience he only wanted the contract signed not love thank you very much
Feb 22 2015,neutral,ok read the book if you want to understand it all book is a solid 4 of 5 stars movie tries to follow the book for a while then deviates big time and it only confuses things without ruining it some dialog and scenes seem to be thrown in for no reason other than in an attempt to follow the book hopefully next movie in the series will be better
Feb 22 2015,positive,the ending was a disappointment aww
Feb 22 2015,positive,perfect chick flick
Feb 22 2015,positive,okay movie not as big as people played it out to be
Feb 22 2015,negative,better than expected because i had zero expectations jamie was a pleasant surprise p
Feb 22 2015,negative,no chemistry what so ever between actors playing christian and anastasia ill stick to the books
Feb 22 2015,positive,i hated the books but i actually liked the movie there were a couple of scenes i didnt care for or that didnt happen in the book and was like thats cheesy but im giving it 3 stars bc i did like it
Feb 22 2015,negative,grey is sexy but i didnt like the movie that much i may be the only one who didnt want to see the nudity but it was a tame version of the book
Feb 22 2015,positive,i think if you read the book first it may affect how you feel about the movie i saw the movie first now reading the book i love both you need to be emotionally mature to understand the movie its not only about sex its about how she changes him
Feb 22 2015,positive,loved it cant wait for the next two
Feb 22 2015,positive,i think that the movie was ok i think if jd researched just a little bit more into dominant personas he would be good i think that dk was fun to watch she brought as to life for the movie jd is very handsome and great i just think a tad more grrr out of him would make him perfect 
Feb 22 2015,negative,porn and twisted version of pretty woman with slightly more nudity leaving a tail for a sequel
Feb 22 2015,negative,only because i couldnt give lower 
Feb 22 2015,positive,both jamie and dakota portrayed their characters well its sexy and romantic only close minded people will not get the actual story of this movie
Feb 22 2015,positive,quirky but sexy   if you are a fan of s and m  or at least a little curious the film is a pretty good fantasy romance  modern fairytale involving a higher end or maybe extreme level of said subject matter or lifestyle  there are many different levels and  or forms so anyway yeah you put that all together and its a little quirky its different its good its a movie based on a book its not a docu drama people curious  go see it just dont see it with your mom maybe your mom is in the screening down the hall
Feb 22 2015,positive,expected the movie to be a little bland like  due to the first book still good cant wait until the second movie 50shades
Feb 22 2015,negative,so bad it went past so bad its good and straight to never rent on dvd     sexist trite flat shallow and uncomfortable in its own skin fifty shades is a finger on the pulse of why we are still sexually repressed in america if this gets you hot you have a sad idea of what sexual freedom is
Feb 22 2015,positive,saw for a 2 nd time  love this movie
Feb 22 2015,positive,if you havent read the books i can understand the nay sayers im glad i went to see it
Feb 22 2015,negative,horrible a very silly and not very well developed plot clichãâ c
Feb 22 2015,positive,i wouldnt expect too much from it its not meant to be taken that serious think twilight with less blood and more sex fun movie to see with your best girlfriend
Feb 22 2015,positive,disappointing compared to the books hopefully the next two will be better
Feb 22 2015,negative,worst piontlessinnapropate movie ever
Feb 22 2015,positive,i thought it was great
Feb 22 2015,positive,in spite of the naysayers i loved the movie and found that it captured the essence of the book im a psychiatrist in boston i wasnt seeking any tittilation i was moved by the profound psychology in the story an outwardly narcissistic man who indeed recognizes that hes tortured inside and a woman who falls in love with him in spite of himself ana cites the same refrain issued by anyone who is married to a compulsive alcohol abuse drug abuse philandering etc she hopes that she can help her mate secure a path to peace if youre psychologically minded youll love the film
Feb 22 2015,positive,i was very surprised the actors they picked  i thought for sure he would not be christian grey but he surprised me by being a very good one  she was amazing ive seen her in other things she played this part to a t  the love story comes through very well in the movie
Feb 22 2015,negative,spoilers  the beginning where anna goes to meet the infamous mr grey is rushed theres no anticipation to it jamie dornan had questionable acting and quite possibly the cheesiest lines in romance film history dakota johnsons drunk seemed obviously fake like the kind when a twelve year old has a sip of beer the chemistry between anna and christian was poor the bath scene you didnt feel the erotica of the characters you felt the awkwardness of the actors just literally awful dornans impression to be intimidating and sexy comes off scary creepy stalker odd cheesy basically far from attractive the amateur orchestra trying to make this intense feel fell apart it is clear that sam taylorjohnsons risks were a failure johnsons character looked like she could see past christians rich faãâade the story was a well planned out porno a rulebook for sex treating sex as a business deal the screenwriters didnt use an interesting vocabulary it sounded like christian was getting anna to join a cult rather than be his submissive jamie dornan would best suit the role of an attractive psychopath like uncle charlie in stoker 2013 for example feminists will hate this movie fair does this film has proven that an erotic beyonce song cant make this film any better  on the whole this film is a formal friends with benefits with truly terrible acting suits and a higher budget
Feb 22 2015,positive,i was shocked by how great dakota johnson did playing anastasia  wow  i dont care what the critics say i loved the movie and was left wishing they already had the next one ready to go
Feb 22 2015,negative,50 shades of grey was such a horrible depiction of bdsm i felt a weird emotion of being offended that they represented ds in such a poor way angry and laughing at how silly it was  when the worst toy he uses is 6 lashings from a jc penny old man belt  i almost died  when he saidi dont make love i fuckhard i felt like i needed a cleanse from how ungodly cheesy this movie is  if people want to see a wonderful and funny depiction of bdsm watch secretary 2002 film
Feb 22 2015,positive,i read the books and thought it was a good movie
Feb 22 2015,neutral,i was very hyped up to see the movie since i love the books so much the movie was very very disappointing and i was very let down it left out so many of the major scenes from the book which made the it hard to follow the movie christian never called her ana in the book he always kept it formal and called her anastasia and of course theres the ending i mean wth the book ended very well the movie however just ended it didnt even touch the end of the book i really hope that the next 2 movies are much better el james really let down her readers with this one
Feb 22 2015,positive,so i saw fifty shades last night gotta say if i had two thumbs to offer in separate review theyd both be up this presentation of a decidedly controversial topic was tastefully done and beautifully acted to boot cinematically it is gorgeous rich in detail not simply depicting the enviable sleek and often salacious lifestyle which simply radiates power among the affluent but also its pointedly cold and barren nature which mirrors christians own unconscious attempt to keep all emotion at bay his struggle will inevitably be a losing one however with early fractures in his veneer already telling in this the first film in the series in name of anna who simply exudes life simplicity warmth and honesty it would be a mistake not to read the excellent print behind the film as although this is a story of fiction with all the baggage of the latest controversy a bds lifestyle brings more importantly it is a character study and a good one at that in the same way that citizen kane or sophies choice or even one flew over the cuckoos nest was christian is by no means nicholson but to view this story in any other light would be a mistake to view this story as one solely about the bds lifestyle would be a mistake this initial film in the series is the beginning of a story spanning 3 literary works in print it is the story of growth and healing and a love story between two polar extremes not opposites per se but so absolutely far removed from one another that we keep shaking our heads smiling fully expecting their relationship to end at any moment thankfully for christian it does not here is a bit of the back story you do not see on screen and probably not until the second film born to a crack addicted prostitute mother as a toddler christian was starved for food daily even the most basic of simple attention and affection denied him by age 4 he is already scarred in so many ways not the least of which being burned repeatedly with cigarettes by her clients until finally he lay on the floor for days next to his mothers body after she was beaten to death christian survives and though he is adopted and made part of a loving family again at the age of 15 when he should be learning about holding hands and attending prom he is sought out and lured in by a despicable adult who introduces him to bdsm listen carefully here however as we find that he is not beyond selfredemption as he plunges headlong into his work which has made him a billionaire in areas promoting a sort of healing worldwide both as a benefactor of food and agriculture programs in developing countries and for technology offered in philanthropy rather than profit i dislike giving spoilers and will not however in an attempt to ameliorate or at least mediate in part some of the controversy from distracting from the work itself i can say that the ride along the way is fraught with angst as his darkness is exposed to the light of day through annas love for him and through dr flynn his insightful and often wryly humorous therapist he is in a sense born again into the light which is his anna through large doses of humility and a love which must be relearned leaving behind a clueless christian who finds himself in love and conquered well thankfully not completely in the end it is the daily struggle within christian to protect anna from himself which heals him the story concerns two people only both over 21 and is not one of rape or nonconsensual sex or sharing of any kind adults will not be turned to the dark side by watching or reading nor will teens although they should not be watching at all that said the lifestyle does exist however and we get the impression that it could be so much darker than we see this warning is inherent throughout the piece and is often lost in the controversy significantly we all come away with the impression that normal is not a word describing christian or the very worst of his lifestyle at the start of the story make no mistake this is not a story about a bds lifestyle or about a girl being taken advantage of because at 21 anna is perhaps one of the strongest women to come out of a fiction piece in a very long time while she is no jane austen character she may well be this centurys version of one
Feb 22 2015,positive,i give this three stars a lot left out of the movie from the book but great acting and a good plot
Feb 22 2015,negative,well the only thing good about this movie was the brownie points i earned from taking my wife to see it despite being very bad best avoided
Feb 22 2015,negative,a silly halfassed twilight fan fiction its bad but not as bad that is good and that make it worse but the cinematograhy was really good and the actors did what they could do to make their best in this movie but with the script and plot that were given yeah one shouldnt expect much
Feb 22 2015,negative,i forced myself to read the first novel because of all the hype and was so disappointed that i didnt bother to read the rest i think this movie franchise will hold my attention for just as long dull slow and by the end of it i wanted to shake anastasia because she was being so procrastinating
Feb 22 2015,positive,it was really good never read the book although i gotta say the ending sucked lol
Feb 22 2015,negative,all around bad movie  slow boring no chemistry  i actually could not believe how bad it was after all the hype  save your money
Feb 22 2015,positive,wasnt expecting much from this film but i actually enjoyed it of course i did read a lot of mills and boon growing up lol
Feb 22 2015,negative,worst movie i have seen in years i actually fell asleep
Feb 22 2015,negative,weird and unsettling  storyline aside which i could see as interesting it was filmed like the teenage movie twilight  poor acting poor screenplay  save your 15 i paid 22 x 2 and go to an adult bookstore
Feb 22 2015,positive,honestly loved it  i didnt like the ending though
Feb 22 2015,negative,this movie doesnt even deserve one star but i have to give at least one in order to write my opinion the actor cast in the role of christian grey was 50 shades of unattractive  i refuse to see any more movies in this franchise not just because jamie dornan was the wrong choice but also because the movie was boring compared to the book
Feb 22 2015,negative,terrible actors even worse than the book and i was so disappointed they dared to play chopin in this meaningless movie
Feb 22 2015,negative,very dry and other than the hot guy not very exciting
Feb 22 2015,negative,this movie was a waste of time they should have named it fifty shaded of waste of time
Feb 22 2015,negative,i have never read an erotica love type story i read mostly nonfiction and mystery novels however i knew my girlfriend wanted to see the movie so i decided to read the book first the baseline story is decent but the writing is extremely redundant and detailed the worst thing this book series could have done was make these into movies the movie was flat out terrible and will destroy the authors reputation for this trilogy anyone that rates this book any higher simply does not read much    the movie should never have been released its a cinemax movie at best
Feb 22 2015,negative,watching dogs mate is more interesting than this movie   so much of the same that it becomes disinteresting  and we know little about the character
Feb 22 2015,positive,i absolutely loved it fans of the books will love the film dakota johnson is absolutely stunning as ana and jamie dornan is perfection hes the only man handsome enough to pull off playing christian grey the leads were beautifully casted and beautifully played i also loved the portrayals of kate and christians mother grace my only disappointment was how much they had to leave out of the film due to the constraints of a 2hour movie well done
Feb 22 2015,negative,a non brainer  sexual film full of shame a nc17 was worth it a film rush made  bad dialogue also
Feb 22 2015,negative,i have not read the books nor do i intend to judging just the film i would say that it was poor acting little character development and lots of sex this is not a love story or a coming of age story it is a story of sexual exploitation and loss of innocence i would not recommend that anyone waste their time in seeing this film the only redeeming entertainment value is that i caught myself laughing out loud at the sheer ridiculousness of the story pure stupid and less than exciting fantasy among my top ten worst movies of all time
Feb 22 2015,positive,very surprised with the outcome of the movie if you get past the young love and crazy sex parts theres a good story the movie cuts some of that out and focuses on the story line  i look forward to the next movie
Feb 22 2015,neutral,not the raunchfest the hype suggested but not a cringeworthy disaster either both leads add some depth and dare i say credibility to what shouldve been paperthin caricatures johnson is very warm and likeable as anna dornan suitably dark and brooding their chemistry is believable theyve even added many moments of deliberate humour the dialogue is clumsy the plot rather preposterous but overall this was surprisingly watchable
Feb 22 2015,positive,a group of friends went and we loved the characters and find ourselves waiting for the sequel watching anastasias awakening and the care christian took to take her there was amazing seeing anastasia slowing break down walls that christian has had up most life powerful
Feb 22 2015,negative,sorry i wasted my time grey was not hot sex scenes were not that sexy and the story line is poor
Feb 22 2015,positive,really do not know what everyone else was expecting you obviously havent read the books or understood the underlining plot of the book if you were expecting full on porn the book has been perfectly adapted to the big screen massive congratulations to dakota and jamie who acted the roles with conviction and bought humour and sparkle to the characters as well as lust and flirtation i loved it and was left cough cough more than satisfied with the film 
Feb 22 2015,positive,the great thing about the film is that you dont have to deal with the girls annoying thoughts that make the book an awful read the inner goddess and such although slow and a bit too pg13 the movie does find sexiness and slickness at certain points
Feb 22 2015,negative,it would have been a miracle to have the made this totally shit book into a movie of any substance  living up to the poor form of the book the film is light on substance and really explores nothing other ran very vanilla sex with a few cool gadgets  mr grey is a psycho and watching her journey was entirely unconvincing
Feb 22 2015,negative,what a stupid movie  the actors do a good job but its a waste of time and money   you have a woman who has enough sense to know hes bad news but she even though she leaves she sticks around too long
Feb 22 2015,negative,this shit was terrible the absolute worse twilight was way better no chemistry between the two at all poor picking in the actors and actresses to portray the characters dont waste your money
Feb 22 2015,positive,different but left u hanging at the end  u know there will be another one
Feb 22 2015,positive,pretty tame in comparison to the books but on the emotional level you can really start to identify with the characters
Feb 22 2015,positive,lets deal with this every individual has their own inner demon like it or not this steamy bestselling adaptation has crashed the box office and surprisingly tickets have been consistently sold out in such a conservative society in this region well i guess everybody has their own unleashed curious kinky skeleton in their closet
Feb 22 2015,positive,loved the books  disappointed with the movie  dakota was distractingly way too skinny with ribs showing badly  jamie was not matched well to the description in book obviously too much writer involvement because it lacked any movie creativity i expected movie did not show the emotional toll christian had on ana that i cried to in book  it also failed to reflect him falling in love with her and how he was being changed because of ana on the next movie i would advise more creativity and less writer involvement and truly showing the developing and imperfect relationship
Feb 22 2015,positive,surprisingly good especially when watching with the gf 
Feb 22 2015,positive,would go and see again left wanting more at the end music was perfectly fitting keeps true to the book and the cast is well picked
Feb 22 2015,positive,i felt this was better than the book
Feb 22 2015,negative,no story line at all lots of sex
Feb 22 2015,negative,over all i was expecting more from this movie both in story and shock story felt incomplete get it as they want you to see the other films to fill in the holes but still didnt capture me as for the sex well lets just say i have see hollywood films in the 80s and 90s which are more daring and exciting missed the boat on this one i think
Feb 22 2015,negative,50 shades of boredom
Feb 22 2015,negative,this movie fails to have a strong story plot the movie itself is anticlimatic and fails to demonstrate eroticism in an artistic way it almost looks like a soft porn film very tasteless film
Feb 22 2015,positive,the cinematography was great and well done
Feb 22 2015,positive,let down i would rename the movie to will you sign the contract
Feb 21 2015,positive,dont hate on the movie if you havent read the books there is so much in the book that isnt in the movie which is always the case they cant put it all in the movie or it would probably be like a 4 hour movie i feel like maybe some narration would have helped it some but it is what it is
Feb 21 2015,negative,i read all the books i enjoyed the progression of the love story and the ups and downs of their relationship but i must say i was very disappointed in this film and it is not one elementits all of them     the cast  christian was originally suppose to be portrayed by charlie hunnam sons of anarchy and because of scheduling issues he had to pull out in my opinion they should have waited for him the actor that ended up being christian jamie dornan was less than alluring than hunnam how do you go from hunnam to dornan they are two opposite sides of the spectrum they should recast and retry this movie but if that is not possible they should at least recast the main characters christian was a serious disappointment    truthfully i didnt feel like any of the cast was fully committed to the characters therefore portrayed them poorly the portrayal was not convincing christian is no where near what he was described as in the book even if had i not read the books you couldnt sell me on the whole bdsmsexgod thing he isnt appealing enough nor does he have the on screen presence in any of the scenes that would make someone feel captivated by him christian grey is suppose to be enticing suave and undeniablei felt non of that at all   ana left more to be desired there were a few times where she seemed committed to the scenes and in other scenes it was like she was reading off of a teleprompter   i think that kate the roommate and the mothers were fine their parts arent that huge where they could do any more damage than what was being done by the main characters already elliot should be recast along with his brother elliot is supposed to be as handsome and tantalizing as christian just in a more ruggedcare free way he looked like he stepped out of the backwoods  of montana some where he reminded me of joe dirt thats not a good thing ray anas father was too loving and affectionate at graduation his entire character is about him being not so emotional or affectionate why would you make him emotional and overly affectionate when the last movie depends on that element of his personality   the only person who was properly cast in this film was taylor the bodyguard and that isnt saying much because he had very few lines in the  film any way the book was written very well and with very few tweaks like removing the inner monologues and removing a couple extra sex scenes it should have gone straight to film it makes me wonder if they have ever heard the proverb if it aint broke dont fix it i understand that it was the first movie and maybe they couldnt afford any alist actors but they could have got some solid raw talent from somewhere  and where the hell was ms jones how they just ton cut her out    the script  set  the script was just horrible they left out many details although they may seem small they foreshadow things that happen in the movie like she didnt interview for any jobs the whole second book therefore second movie if they even have one at this point is focused around her job at sip as is the third installment what clown decided to strike that from the script when it is the set up for the rest of the movies   lets not call this person a clown this person was most likely the smartest person in the room they must have figured out early that they project wouldnt make it past the first film so they just threw quality to the wind and went with it   this is a love story so changing scenes that remove the ebb and flow of their relationship and how they fall for each other and prove it is dumb  there is one scene where ana leaves christians condo and she is in her room and crying and what ever other dramatics and christian goes to her house fights past kate and makes his way to her even though he knows she is mad they left that out they left out all of his trips to her house except afterand its not about the lack of sex scenes they werent executed properly either but the book is more than the sexual encounters the love story didnt even make since in its development granted its a short time between meeting and falling in love but they didnt have to make it this bad   luckily the set design was pretty nice escala where he lives is set up the way it is in the book that was the most accurate part of the entire movie the kitchen was set up weird but i guess the breakfast bar got cut out with ms jones christians parents house was nice along with ana and kates apartment in seattle i didnt like the heathman hotel because it is describes as a grand suite with  not quite an apartment type set up but it does include a living room area where important scenes in the third movie should take place wheres the living room at it looked like they were at the ramada   i just feel bad for the director i want to say that they needed better direction but what can you really do with people that are just not right for a part     basically  this movie was a train wreck the kind that you can see transpiring but you just cant look away i wanted to love it i really did they just made it so so so challenging i know the movie made a lot of money but that is not a reflection of the quality of the film but the following of the book  this should have been a straight to dvd film or vh1 after dark presents because i regret paying to see this mess
Feb 21 2015,positive,you know  it wasnt too bad i was pleasantly surprised i couldnt believe when the credits rolled because it meant that i actually got into it i want to see the next one now
Feb 21 2015,negative,im sorry if you ever see this movie
Feb 21 2015,positive,so over all i have to say that im pretty open minded when it comes to movies and im especially open minded when it comes to movies about sex however even though i only got about half way through the first book i was able to create my idea of how the characters shouldve been behaving with one another the book does a much better job at character building as it should but even then it was a little dull this film puts forth zero effort into building up the relationships with each character  theres no suspenseful build up when anastasia meets christian for the first time zero the chemistry between the antagonist and protagonist is non existent i was optimistic about how this movie would turn out and i just have to say that this movie is everything you expect it to be at the end of the day amateur porn with some hollywood flare  a for effort
Feb 21 2015,positive,considering how horribly written the books are the movie was much better
Feb 21 2015,negative,sex lies and videotape secretary etc are great movies for people looking to be educated and entertained in this subject    wait wasnt the character in secretary named mr grey el james is such a hack no wonder this movie sucks
Feb 21 2015,negative,worse than you think in ways you cant conceive
Feb 21 2015,positive,i thought this movie was great and stuck really close to the book and there was nothing abusive or forced about it these were two consenting adults and last time i checked it was a free country for people to do and believe in what they want
Feb 21 2015,positive,i thought it was good it was as close to the book as it could be without being too long and going over an r rating did it have some bad moments of course but i do not think it was as bad as people keeping claiming it to be from a fan of the books it is good the beginning is a bit choppy but the rest of it good and the actors have more chemistry than others claim they have as well and the soundtrack is amazing
Feb 21 2015,positive,i want to watch it after i give my rating
Feb 21 2015,negative,does not live up to the book acting is subpar jamie dornan doesnt portray the chiseled face powerful business mogul christian grey missed some of the most interesting detail in the story line should have just stayed true to the book and let el james direct it
Feb 21 2015,positive,i would admit i got quite a bit of amusement out of this show as for the portrayal of the bdsm world oh it was sorely lacking a feather and a flogger with some rope is not cutting it sorry
Feb 21 2015,negative,i was a profound fan of the trilogy of fifty shades of grey but not the least bit about the movie personally it was a huge disappointment and lacked many valuable and frankly more interesting  than what was shown with the lack of all those valuable scenes the move lacked the love and passion described in the book the actors were awkward towards each other and i was even more bummed out per say due to how ana was being portrayed ana was supposedly a shy girl that at her moments didnt care about speaking her mind but in the movie it made her very sarcastic  which was  in my experience just made all of the people in the theaters laugh like it was a comedy instead of a romance film all in all the move sucked and i am not looking forward to the second movie of the fifty shades of grey trilogy
Feb 21 2015,positive,going to this movie without have read the books i was not expecting much however i was pleasantly surprised all though some the acting was a little less than believable in some aspects i realized that there was more to the story than just a man dominating a woman after seeing the movie i decided to read the books and find that i was rightthere is much more to this story the first book is not as exciting as the 2nd and 3rd in my opinion but acted more as a set up for the rest of the plot line there are a few different reasons that i see why people have given this movie a bad review 1 they did not read the books and do not understand how the story begins to unfold 2 people cannot get past the sm in the story but there is a reason why it has a such a large presence in the story 3 the fans of the series are upset with the casting choices but the truth is we get attached to the story and build these characters up that the actors are set up for failure trying to fufill peoples visions of how the character should portrayed overall while i do agree the connection between the actors could have been a little more believable i enjoyed the movie and cannot wait to see how the 2nd and 3rd books unfold on screen
Feb 21 2015,neutral,tie me up let me down  my review of fifty shades of grey 2  12 stars    based on the originally selfpublished book by el james which originated as fan fiction of the twilight saga fifty shades of grey is as toothless as its inspiration and strangely enough bloodless  this is odd considering the bdsm nature of its central relationship      directed by sam taylorjohnson nowhere boy and adapted by kelly marcel saving mr banks the filmmakers appear to have borrowed more from its kinkier 1986 predecessor 9  12 weeks than from the aforementioned vampire trilogy  with sleek but barren 80sstyle production design by david wasco pulp fiction and uncharacteristically faceless cinematography from the usually brilliant seamus mcgarvey anna karenina atonement fifty shades feels like an empty product from a lost time  think flashdance with light domination instead of tight gyration  i mean jesus our heroine uses a flip phone fer crissakes  a flippin flip phone    fortunately that heroine is played by dakota johnson daughter to don johnson and melanie griffith and she is so good here that she almost makes the film worthwhile  i loved her on the shortlived sitcom ben and kate noting her ability to utilize terrific comic timing while making room for vulnerability  her style is highly reminiscent of her mothers who claimed she learned how to relax and breathe in front of the camera by working with mike nichols on her starmaking triumph working girl      her daughter has clearly taken her mothers advice and brings such charm to her role the character is anastasia steele a ridiculous name that i think even fabio would be embarrassed were he to pose for a book cover called the bodice rippings of anastasia steele  indeed its exactly where that character name belongs  regardless johnson is poised to become a huge star and her work here is deserving of praise    back to the story  anastasia is sent by her roommate kate who comes down with the flu eloise mumford a dead ringer for sienna miller to interview business tycoon christian grey jamie dornan in her stead  grey of course turns out to be young gorgeous and manipulative  they quickly fall for each other  you can tell because she chews her pencil and he stares at her  soon enough he admits to her that he doesnt do romance and instead prefers a dominantsubmissive relationship      naturally because hes rich great looking has a helicopter rents out gliders and owns a killer apartment she says yes  i suppose thats the aspirational appeal of this claptrap but lets not kid ourselves had christian grey been played by jonah hill as a homeless sexual deviant she would be spraying mace instead of her scent all over this stinker      eventually grey starts raising the stakes byumreally  he spanks her  he flogs her lightly  he covers her eyes and binds her hands with a necktie  im sorry but ive seen more subversive acts in a village people video than anything going on here  late in the film she asks grey to bring out the big guns  he chooses a simple belt to whip her a few grades harder than before but that damn belt was hanging next to notched paddles and fare edgier fare  why pull punches at the climax  many will say its because grey is developing feelings for anastasia  that would be true if i believed grey possessed them but as portrayed by dornan hes a onenote empty shell  sure thats the part he was hired to play and im sure dornan has some talent but hes just not given the chance  i kept waiting for something shocking  a cigar burn welts blood crazy zipper masks  i dont know  when did sex movies become so tame  this is just kinda boring meandering and oftentimes silly  its not the disaster everyone was fearinghoping for mainly because of johnson but its not gonna make anyone whip out a cm rag either shortbus seems so long ago
Feb 21 2015,positive,honestly i really dont think this is all that deep silly book silly movie weird chemistry between characters in the book weird chemistry in the movie and yet both arehot it was what it set out to be loved it
Feb 21 2015,negative,slow boring high hopes but it flat lined within the first 20min
Feb 21 2015,positive,i wonder if i am one of the few who actually enjoyed this film and am probably the only one who thought the actors were perfect for the role lol
Feb 21 2015,negative,i cant believe i watched this  definitely not the target audience but i cant believe women like this crap  lets just set aside the fact that parts of this movie are basically softcore porn  the dialogue and acting are soooo bad the story is even worse i also cant believe there is going to be two more of these things  garbage
Feb 21 2015,negative,15 stars for the nudity
Feb 21 2015,negative,dont waste your money
Feb 21 2015,positive,i ultimately enjoyed the movie although i was disappointed in a couple things left out of the film i especially felt they short changed the very end leaving out much of the emotional exchange between christian and ana why cut out christian holding ana all night crying before she left him this is why erika should write the screenplays i am one of few who actually like jamie dornan as christian and i just dont see all the awkwardness between he and dakota that people are whining about
Feb 21 2015,positive,i cannot deal with the hairy thighs and the 50 shades of bushlol
Feb 21 2015,positive,much better then i expected most sexy movie i have every seen very brave performances
Feb 21 2015,positive,very close to the book i was impressed mr grey can be a little more aggresive
Feb 21 2015,positive,great movie they did a wonderful job portraying the characters in the book i cannot wait for the next movie
Feb 21 2015,positive,thought it was great to truly appreciate youd have to read the books which doesnt seem like a lot of viewers did not sure why so many people are offendedit is rated r anyway just one gals opinion hatersjust stop hating peace
Feb 21 2015,positive,good movie to watch with some friends entertaining 
Feb 21 2015,negative,the book is far better this move gave christian no justice his character is far more than this move portrayed
Feb 21 2015,negative,really really bad movie
Feb 21 2015,positive,ladies if u read all the books and can read in between the lines i thought movie excellent and done quite tastefully this is truely a love story of self discovery on both sides one in particular fifty shades of  up figuring it out
Feb 21 2015,negative,i didnt think it possible but the movie was even worse than the book with the book being the scum of the earth for anyone unfamiliar with the book im not sure how you could even follow it  i barely could and i did read the books there was barely any characterization and no emotion the overwhelming music seemed like an attempt to make up for the lack of depth  that the movie had if the music is intense it will hold your attention more than the mistakes onscreen the costumer must have been out of their mind and the hair styling dakota johnson looked like she was wearing a wig her hair was so frizzy and poorly managed i feel like i was watching a hallmark movie not a blockbuster the acting was atrocious johnson gave little except a consistent look of nausea and dornan had no dominating presence which was key he was just kind of there plus the story didnt make any sense it was just ticking off certain events from the book but no flow why was ana so adamant about normal dating when christian repeatedly express that he wasnt on board for that why would she ask him to do things to her but then get pissed at him for doing it are you even a human being ana steele you function as though you have no brain the relationship in the movie was almost fatherdaughter with brainlessinnocentgiggly steele being educated and put in her place by her father grey this was not the relationship in the book also the sex scenes could they have gotten any more shots of her breasts and any less shots of his penis thank you for yet again for sexualizing women and portraying them in an illogical overly emotional fashion while the man is not presented in the same way
Feb 21 2015,negative,infinite shades of abysmal good actress and decent soundtrack but the guy who played christian grey is possibly the worst actor of the year    review coming later
Feb 21 2015,negative,didnt exactly blow my pants off
Feb 21 2015,negative,the movie was not entretaining at the very list boring plotless with sex being the main character with the most personality porn is better
Feb 21 2015,negative,what did i just watch it left me feeling dirty and not in the good way
Feb 21 2015,positive,the movie was good but the ending was terrible
Feb 21 2015,positive, lol   fifty shades of grey  
Feb 21 2015,negative,while the directors mostly stuck to the script whoever cast the main characters was way off base to make the actor playing christian grey seem intense and brooding they had him frown a lot  the result was a pensive and confused doogie houser look a like  dakota johnson looked like a forty something older woman with a 100 miles of bad road on her she also looked really swanky  nothing at all like the sexy girl next door innocent that was anastasia steele  to top it off these actors had absolutely no chemistry between themthe director did focus a lot on the bdsm as i knew they would totally discounting that this was a coming of age love story i quickly got bored with the intimate scenes what with dakota gasping at every touch and writhing against her bonds
Feb 21 2015,negative,this movie sucked so bad i hated the books and thought the movie would be better but i was wrong it was a dull and very slow moving movie i felt like it was never going to end also christian gave me the creeps
Feb 21 2015,negative,although the movie was intense with plenty of steamy love scenes i feel that  they over cut each transition from scene to scene you would have to read the book just to fill in the blanks and the over all relationship between ana and christian was very forced i didnt feel that same pull with these actors as i did with the book
Feb 21 2015,positive,not bad but not great
Feb 21 2015,positive,i have not read the books instead looked at a bunch of poor reviews of the movie before going into the see it  it is not a porn but it does have things that are inappropriate for an adolescent one who is in high school to see it  a little nervous that it was rated r knowing that 17 above could see something like this  anyhow there were some funny lines  and i think the critics are blowing this movie out of the water saying it was all that bad  im sure i read the stories it probably would have been more fun
Feb 21 2015,positive,too much ho ha about it but not all that
Feb 21 2015,positive,why did i go see it jamie dornan nuff said but i think dakota johnson is very talented and has a bright future it was a good movie but not great if this is what horny housewives resort to then i feel for them
Feb 21 2015,positive,overall worth seeing   it is better than i expected after reading all the reviews   the settings and atmosphere throughout the film is very nice the cast is great but the plot really needs some work
Feb 21 2015,negative,for reference i never read the books which i hear are true winners   i went  with and for my friend who is a big fan at her request  this film is barely that with its terrible anticlimactic plot and shallow characters  dialogue was dismal at best  characters were dull over or underacted  the prevailing theme of frightening control and domination over a weak naive character is tantamount to emotional abuse  spend your money elsewhere any where else
Feb 21 2015,positive,i thought the movie was absolutely amazing i have read the books and feel in love with them it just not about the sex but about the romance between them that they feel for each other
Feb 21 2015,neutral,great music terrible actors 
Feb 21 2015,neutral,the movie is an acurate depiction of the book i read the book and i was neither dissapointed or thrilled with the film adaptation it was an average book that spawned an average movie
Feb 21 2015,negative,what a disappointment dont bother with a sequel please from an ardent fan of the books
Feb 21 2015,positive,would have gave more if they would have picked a better christian grey i want sexy for him jamie dornan didnt do it for me i do wanna see it again cause it did go by the book and i am addicted lol
Feb 21 2015,positive,only people who have an appreciation for movies will understand the brilliance of this film it was tastefully done  the end leaves so much build for the upcoming sequel it was just enough suspense to get you excited for whats to come
Feb 21 2015,positive,it was just okthe actress did a great job portraying anastasia steele but the casting for christian grey was completely wrong and it was evident in the first 5 minutes
Feb 21 2015,positive,i have a feeling some people reviewing this movie are scoring it before theyve actually seen it or are watching it just because they want to have something to criticize its like reading the book knowing that you will hate it but you want to jump on the bandwagon to say how badly written it is as someone who read the books i can say that i liked the books and actually enjoyed the movie even though i had really really low expectations i thought both actors were surprisingly good at bringing the characters to life especially ana steele and there was definite sexual chemistry on the screen at least but then again i like the genre and yes i admit it i like that its a bunch of girly nonsense and an erotic fantasy for many women i dont take it seriously and wasnt hoping that it would be something it is not and im looking forward to see how they tackle the second one
Feb 21 2015,positive,i loved it i think the actors did great on their parts i cant wait to see the next one
Feb 21 2015,neutral,it was definitely better than the book however the was still something to be desired you could tell it was nothing more than a twilight knock off with sex pretty much what i expected walking in and i really didnt leave disappointed because i knew what to expect
Feb 21 2015,negative,wishing there was a better lead actor
Feb 21 2015,positive,it was very good they hit on a lot of the points in the book that most just skip  there has been more nudity in other movies  it had me wanting to see the other sequels  people that dont like this movie or put down need to learn sex doesnt have to be black and white anymore  a true and wonderful movie  seen it twice  u really should get out more and not be true asses when rating a movie  everyone has different thoughts and like  awesome job and great acting
Feb 21 2015,negative,the most boring sex movie ive ever seen
Feb 21 2015,negative,as the first of 3 booksmovies i expected much more character development  i have not read the books and was disappointed after all the hype  the christian grey character came across as a self indulgent narcissistic shutin with little ability to interact socially when hes a self proclaimed reader of people  the anastasia character was extremely one dimensional and unrelatable as a soon college virgin graduate that has average social skills yet has never found any men in her life interesting enough to have the normal loving relationship she desires for herselfthese two people arent star crossed lovers  their polar opposites 
Feb 21 2015,negative,well ive some problems actually getting the right words to describe this piece of well its not even art it tries to be a porn movie suitable for open public but lets be honest even a real porn movie would have better dialogues than 50sog
Feb 21 2015,negative,this was a worldwide phenomenon why nothing happens at least the twilight saga had bad acting and violence this doesnt even have that the actors are fine dakota johnson might even be good theyre just not saying anything if this movies mission was to be so boring that eventually i dont even appreciate nudity then it is a complete success if this movie wanted to be a movie that told a story about people doing anything then it is a failure
Feb 21 2015,negative,it goes from its so bad its good to its so bad its bad in 15 minutes
Feb 21 2015,negative,literature student anastasia steeles life changes forever when she meets handsome yet tormented billionaire christian grey    fifty shades is the story of anastasia steele dakota johnson a shy college literature student getting reading to graduate with her whole life ahead of her when a friend falls ill ana decides to help her friend out and interview charismatic but tormented billionaire christian grey jamie dornan when the interview turns into a flirting session mr grey develops an infatuation for ana and after some chance encounters and borderline stalking the two enter a dominant  submissive relationship however this billionaire has a haunted past thats has shaped him into a twisted adult and innocent ana struggles to decipher between love and lust in an attempt to break down mr greys emotional walls    based on the best selling el james fifty shades franchise of 2011 fifty shades of grey is the first entry into a proposed trilogy of literature for the jilted generation outside of the amazing cinematography and the fact sam taylor johnson was attached to direct its hard to praise this movie really dakota johnson puts in a serviceable performance but is shackled by the restraints of her character and when she isnt biting her lip 67 times in 125mins her lines are clunky and her appearance uninspired i know what your saying and it is what it is essentially its a book made extremely popular by repressed housewives on holiday bdsm enthusiasts and bandwagoners a movie was inevitable the fifty shades book franchise did achieve a positive goal i will add however it encouraged a generation albeit primarily female to start reading again you couldnt pick a more abysmal book to rekindle your love for literature but ill call it a win anyway jamie dornan plays the alpha male player very well and as a viewer with a limited knowledge of the plot i found the character quite entertaining i dont expect this movie to do well critically as it isnt very good to do the trilogy justice it should have been condensed to one movie but that would never happen as it would only equate to a third of the box office receipts however people are going to pour money into cinemas to see this movie because it has 14 mins of sex scenes and contrary to the highly cerebral storyline laugh out loud that is the only selling point outside of jamie doran of this production dont rush out to see it i wouldnt even recommend renting it can you still do that its not good at all unless your a fan of 2 dimensional acting stalking and domestic violence    futureproof movie review score 50
Feb 21 2015,positive,i loved the movie it was exactly how i pictured it would be it was great seeing the book come to life can not wait for them to start filming fifty shades darker and freed
Feb 21 2015,positive,i give it a three because they left out so much from the book jamie is not christian grey dakota is very much ana the vision i have in my head from the book is very much different however lets say i didnt read the book then i would still give it a 3 because it seemed like they skipped around to much it was hard to follow just my two cents
Feb 21 2015,negative,ok so i saw 50 shades the acting was terrible the plot nonexistent    it was like thisimagine youre at a dingy bus stop waiting for the bus to come the bus will be 2 hours late so you have two hours to wait that annoying tv in the corner someone is changing channels on it between porn and days of our lives yes the soundtrack is good but thats because youve got your headphones in listening to your ipod so as to avoid talking to the other people waiting for busses the coffee at the bus stop cafe is too hot to cover up the fact that it tastes bad anyway then they tell you your bus is cancelled and you go home wondering what the fuck was the point of all that then    zero stars fuck me negative stars can you do that sure why not
Feb 21 2015,neutral,exploitation of a virgin not cool a real world have walked away  plus the movie wasnt that provocative enough
Feb 21 2015,negative,50 shades of shit  bland boring and overhyped   just like the bombay sapphire he ironically drinks in the movie it is a mediocre product made out to be something special by clever marketing
Feb 21 2015,negative,horrible acting no action no climax
Feb 21 2015,negative,a competely inappropriate movie children do not need to see people having sex in billboards stop advertising
Feb 21 2015,neutral,ok movie  dakota johnson was best part  played the role well and was actually a believable character with down to earth traits movie was way too long by about an hour on the whole though while bdsm is an interesting subject for a movie to explore this one did a very poor job of it having said that my expectations were super low and it modestly surprised on the upside it wasnt as bad as i thought  it would be
Feb 21 2015,positive,not overly bad however not very great either
Feb 21 2015,negative,no chemistry between the actorsvery slow moving  walked out of the theatre the movie was just that bad
Feb 21 2015,negative,so ive not rated this higher due to where the actual acting  production of the film however i  everyone else in the cinema realised that christian grey was a bit of a bad man i didnt change my views on what i think is an acceptable amount of violence towards women none btw i obv havent read the books however my main problem was with the male lead couldnt decide whether he was still irish or in fact american very poor chemistry between the leads there have been tons of films with baddies in a pertinent example is the movie greenberg yes we are expected to be more sympathetic to mr grey but it doesnt mean that i agreed with his obviously abusive tendencies but whats the alternative movies about bunnies  rainbows theres bad people on the planet  that just isnt realistic
Feb 21 2015,negative,its glossy and highly stylised the soundtrack is quite good and there are some nice shots of seattle at night  thats all it really has going for it the dialogue could quite possibly be the worst in recent memory which will come as no surprise to anyone who has read the book there is hardly any chemistry between anastasia and christian and whilst its perfectly reasonable to expect a film about bdsm to be uncomfortable to watch its another thing entirely when it happens to also be painfully dull it would have perhaps been one of the biggest middle finger moments in history if fifty shades of grey had been able to prove its sceptics wrong but you get the feeling that sam taylorjohnson was never allowed enough creative control of the project for this to be even remotely achievable
Feb 21 2015,negative,ok so i took one for the team plus owed dan for the almost amazing interstellar all i can say is what a load of shat wasnt sexy just boring although the rough and somewhat horny women sat up front was mildly more entertaining with her random virbal outburst avoid
Feb 21 2015,neutral,it was one big yawn even the sex scenes were tedious the characters over reacted in every scene should have went straight to netflix
Feb 21 2015,negative,its too bad the boring sec had to come into play and ruin a perfectly good awkward comedy i laughed a lot for the first 45 minutes the whole audience did not as bad as i expected
Feb 21 2015,neutral,what if kate upton played anastasia steel
Feb 21 2015,positive,absolutely loved this movie
Feb 21 2015,positive,fifty shades of grey was sickntwisted    walking in i had a little more knowledge than an infamous title an r rating and a comparison to 9 12 weeks i thought i was prepared for anything i was not     shall we say curiosity thrilled the cat then smacked some sense into her yet and still the storyline was totally enticing thanks to the fine performances by the lead actors     jamie and dakota had great chemistry he with his hypnotic alluring  eyes and she with her responsive pleasure principles     i must say although grey was well put together via acting and directing i found it difficult to watch for many reasons some of which were made public by political protesters     in short to me this was s guyflick as usual women were totally exposed while the guys were fully clothed what an imbalance of power     at any rate couples viewing this film may find it interesting to say the least enjoy
Feb 21 2015,positive,your either going to love it or your going to hate it      i went to see the movie before i started reading the books  i thought the movie was good  im not sure if i like reading the book better than the movie  i guess i will know once im done with the first book    the way they ended the movie was perfect  it will either make you want to see more or just say thank goodness its over  for me i want to see what happens next
Feb 21 2015,positive,i thought it was an entertaining fun movie  did not read any of the books son da like that helped
Feb 21 2015,positive,i have seen this and i enjoyed and i would go and see it again
Feb 20 2015,positive,not as bad as reviews
Feb 20 2015,neutral,very very tame for the hype that preceded it the dude came off as a total puss with some mental and emotional issues this movie ramped up slowly i presume not to upset the female demographic too much nonetheless quite pathetic for the premises of sm and a supposedly powerful male character
Feb 20 2015,negative,not even a renter bad casting worse acting they just threw out random bits of the book and depended solely on porn to sell this fell completely flat
Feb 20 2015,negative,terrible dont waste your time
Feb 20 2015,negative,they should have cast someone with more acting skills  same goes with the directors
Feb 20 2015,neutral,wasnt as bad as i thought it would be
Feb 20 2015,positive,i didnt think it was bad watching this movie i didnt expect much what i got were nice visuals a protagonist who felt real and a conflict that felt genuine i wasnt objecting to this movie in my head as it happened and it was surprisingly inoffensive and not just a mess of erotica sure these characters arent all that deep and their bondage even less so and the conflict does get repetitive towards the end but there wasnt anything in this movie that bothered or irritated me very much and there were actually some pluses   possibly the best part of the film was that the protagonist played by dakota johnson felt real johnson portrays her characters shyness without seeming fake and is able to sustain her realness even in weird situations where you might expect a stumble her relationship with christian grey was also believable she spends a whole lot of this movie objecting to christians ideas of a relationship asking the same questions that we have i found her easy to identify with within this movie that would not have worked at all without that due to the weird subject matter as the movie progresses and the conflict rises we even get a glimpse into the depth of christian grey who is totally onenote but why becomes the question that anastasia asks i felt like most of the movie we werent rooting for her to be christians submissive and i expected the audience to only want her to get fucked and whipped its not porn whatsoever expectation defied  speaking of subject matter which is getting this movie a ton of attention it seems much more dedicated to other aspects of its story this movie wasnt even sexy i didnt want it to be so thats fine some people might want that and might be disappointed but i didnt care the sex scenes werent too enjoyable for me and i couldnt tell how much the movie wanted me to be aroused by them the fact that the subject was different actually prevented this movie from being over familiar since we dont see this kind of relationship on film very often   the visuals are nice looking and best of all theyre spacious i could see this story being suffocated by mediocre cinematography but the director and cinematographer give us a lot of breathing room theyre slick and clean looking  there are stupid lines of dialogue sure i suspect that the director was aware of how silly these lines were and i think theyre supposed to make us laugh and they succeed the movie knows that you know what it is   problems sure there are some minor inconsistencies and ehh moments throughout the film but nothing that ruined it for me anastasias desire for a real relationship with christian the main conflict becomes pretty repetitive after a while this movie could have easily been twenty minutes shorter there is also a lack of depth in anastasias fascination with christian and his fascination with her their attraction is just that they love each other its surface level but thats good enough to work in this movie while i felt that anastasias character was real shes not that deep and nothing is revealed about her past christian is the opposite where he feels almost unreal but there are hints of depth in him most of which are left hanging by the end of the film i actually liked what the film left the audience hanging with and the decision that the protagonist ultimately made i can see a lot of people becoming bored somewhere towards the end of this film because of the repetitiveness of the story and blandness of parts especially if you want a lot of sex but i was into it most of the time   overall this movie surprised me theres nothing here that hints at greatness but i cant complain all that much i think if you want to go see this movie with some friends for fun or whatever go for it you could easily go into this movie wanting to hate it and getting exactly that but i think people who go in with an open mind might just find themselves enjoying it more than they expected
Feb 20 2015,negative,i tried and failed to read the book it was too horribly written from the movie it seems like the mr grey actor did not read it either the anastasia actor was on point just as irritating as the lead character in the book i felt bad for the mr grey actor he seemed out of his depth with fully expressing the character or even just expressing himself the movie seemed to be about sexual freedom and the whole time he seemed so restrained and uncomfortable watch the fall its the same thingthey need to consider replacing him with a stronger male actor he looks too much like the gerber baby i would not want to watch the remaining two films to this seies it would need major upgrades i think a good movie can be made but it needs stronger actors with better connection so they dont have to rely so much on the sex scenes which got extremely boring and repetitive after a while someone please save jamie dorian from this minefield he got set up in
Feb 20 2015,negative,trash movie and long as heck paid 21 dollars just for a hbo soft porn movie
Feb 20 2015,positive,sex who doesnt love sex
Feb 20 2015,neutral,fifty shades of meh the story was straight out of a harlequin romance with some light kink thrown in anne rice wrote better erotica in the 1980s especially exit to eden which rob reiner turned into a terrible movie by trying to add comedy someone should remake it the best things about the movie were the score by danny elfman my personal favorite and the cinematography i hope the sequels are better
Feb 20 2015,negative,absolutely awful but the book wasnt very good either didnt even finish it it was that bad
Feb 20 2015,positive,50 shades is a movie that pushes the extreme limitshard limits xd   if youre only interested in the sexually charged portions of the film than i believe you are seeing the film for a wrong reason the energy and connection between ana  christian  isnt just pure sex and gag toys his inner story is just as interesting and possibly even better than that of when they are going to screw and how many times     the book couldve been written better but it displayed its story nicely properly and even enough for even the most asexual person to feed into this movie went  the right direction and has left everyone i know satisfied
Feb 20 2015,positive,enjoyed this more than expected  seemed to be fairly true to the book  for me was a sexed up version of pretty woman with some controversial dominantsubmissive twists which i find interesting in this story as not s  m fan at all 
Feb 20 2015,positive,reflects the story from the book and improves upon it
Feb 20 2015,positive,went in with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised babyboomnumbertwoinninemonths
Feb 20 2015,positive,1 of the best comedys i have ever seen
Feb 20 2015,positive,i did not read the books and really didnt care if i saw the movie or not i figured it was going to be all sex and more sex i was wrong i really really liked this movie and so glad i let a friend talk me in to going i came home after the movie and downloaded the next 2 books it was a great story and i can hardly wait to see what happens next
Feb 20 2015,negative,sht movie dont watch it
Feb 20 2015,positive,never read the books took a chance and enjoyed the flick
Feb 20 2015,positive,love it watch it twice
Feb 20 2015,positive,someone should have warned me about fifty shades of grey i didnt read the books and i sure wish i hadnt seen the movie how the heck would anyone wanna watch that movie on valentines day this story was more disturbing than erotic i guess i am the only one that noticed that this guy was molested and abused as a child that is not okay and it resulted in a controlling and physicallyemotionally abusing man that stalks and treats women as his property i felt that readers and fans of this movie obviously overlooked the disturbing history of the male character and how it has resulted in an inability to have a respectful healthy and equal relationship with a woman christian grey doesnt need a submissive he needs a psychologist
Feb 20 2015,negative,well the lighting was good and some of the shots were framed pretty wee but lets be honest when you take away all the bdsm stuff 50 shades has some of the worst dialogue in a film ever not to mention horrible characters     christian grey just kind of keeps showing up to things like a stalker and wont stop asking her if she signed the contract then just keeps buying anastasia a car laptop and things to keep her invested in him when she clearly isnt even into itthe entire time thats ok though because anastasia is the kind of woman that is not only a sterotype of submission but literally cant survive without a man because as a woman who needs independence or god forbid a voice to speak up ondid we mention shes a virginof course she is    how about that kink though its like the halmark card of anything resembling bondageseriously hbo has better sex scenes she asks him at the end to do his worst to him even though previous scenes clearly shows that he owns a bullwhip he spanks her with his belt until she gets mad and leaves technically she did have predetermined safewords in that slave contract that she never got around to not to mention that even though he has a very expensive playroom he spends the majority of the time tying her wrists with with a necktie cause gotta get some product placement in i love when she reviewed the contract she was like my limits are suspension vaginal clamps and fisting then asks whats a butt plug you know what all that other stuff is but not what a butt plug is and you couldnt tell what it is by the name of it ugh     i saw this for free so i can still say that i didnt support or endorse it i still think jupiter ascending was my least favorite film of 2015 but 50 shades of grey is pretty close dont worry kids there are at least two more films coming grade f
Feb 20 2015,positive,four stars and a half because of some little details they missed from the book leaving that out i liked it i liked how they portrayed they characters specially dakota waiting for the next movie to come out
Feb 20 2015,negative,if i could give it a lower one i would
Feb 20 2015,negative,anastasia is less annoying in this film than she is in the book but she still made me roll my eyes on many an occasion with her stupidity  christian was one dimensional at best and also made me roll my eyes at what a badly developed character he is  also the writing was better than the book with far less holy fuck holy hell and my inner goddess polevaults over the fifteenfoot bar internal exclamations from anastasia
Feb 20 2015,negative,it super sucked and made no sense as a movie
Feb 20 2015,neutral,i just want to know one thing how did this movie only get an r rating when it contains more nudity and sex than that of films in the past such as showgirls for example funny no one notices that and is all hung up on the hype     story wise its nearly identical to the book if you read the book youll get no surprises here other than the film contains slightly less sex than the book mostly because you can only bone for so long before the message gets lost     another thing that people seem to be missing and of course getting all caught up in the sex insteadseriously i wonder what the hidden meaning is there this moviebook isnt about sex this movie is about a damaged guy who has emotional problems problems that the main character thinks she can resolve with a few kisses and hugs she can see the pain and turmoil that was in this mans life and only wants to kiss his pain away     thats what i got out of it if you are not interested in those mushy feelings you can always go see it for some carnal sex that is a little better than what you would find on youporn
Feb 20 2015,positive,surprisingly good close to the book and erotic not too much
Feb 20 2015,positive,personally i really enjoyed this movie and yes i did read the books i think that they took the stance of making it more into a movie that people could actually watch rather than xxx porno maybe thats why so many people werent impressed it had an amazing story line and it wasnt over the top
Feb 20 2015,positive,i went to watch it with some friends who invited me and i fell in love with dakota johnsons interpretation of anastasia steele shes become my favorite actress and jamie dornan didnt do such a bad job as christian grey
Feb 20 2015,positive,one of the very few films that stays absolutely true to the book beautiful
Feb 20 2015,neutral,this movie was extremely saucy
Feb 20 2015,negative,sexist cheesy and most of all boring this horrible film adapted from its horrible book makes twilight look like a masterpiece
Feb 20 2015,positive,i loved this movie i read the books and they were amazing yes the movie was different from the books they always are who cares if they didnt do the tampon scene i doubt anyone would want to see that anyway it is actually a great movie if you stop trying to compare the two and just watch the movie
Feb 20 2015,negative,definitely among the top 10 movies ive ever seen poor acting terrible script at least with the book you can cast direct and edit the movie in your imagination god awful
Feb 20 2015,positive,o my goodness this is 5 star all the way i love
Feb 20 2015,positive,i was not excited to see this movie at all but it seemed true to the book and was done well i liked the length and the casting i dont know what all the bad reviews are for
Feb 20 2015,negative,given what i have read about this moviebook and what i have been told by those who have either read it or started reading it then stopped i cannot see any reason to see this movie
Feb 20 2015,negative,my first thought after seeing this movie was did people really take the time to read this i questioned if these lines in the movie are actually from the book to my surprise i learned they are this was not even cheesy dialogue it was just bad dialogue to give it credit it was written based on a fanfiction from twilight so the source material itself was not great to start with    anyways on to the movie the people in this movie are just ridiculous first of all christian grey is a billionaire and has to settle for anastasia as well he was such a creep in this movie is he really like that in the book also are the women that read this book looking for that type of guy i just dont understand the attraction these characters had nothing in common and seemed to have no chemistry i do not understand the connection what i saw every time christian gave her a gift she came back for more which brought me to the conclusion that anastasia is a gold digger    i hope that jamie dornan and dakota johnson can find work somewhere else to actually show their acting chops the roles they have now just makes them look bad as actors and it is not their fault that the script is atrocious i know there were people out there just watching for the sex and some of the scenes were not all that sexy to begin with some were awkward if anything    with the whole controversy of the bookmovie im on the side where you can have your bedroom kinks it should not matter but find those kinks that match with someone else if you even dare watch this movie just watch it at home it does not need to be seen on the big screen wait for it on dvd or something    09  5 stars
Feb 20 2015,positive,i am a huge fan of this book series after first reading it when it was an online fan fiction  i think the movie adaptation was true to the book and that dakota johnson was superb in the role as anna  jamie dornan wasnt horrible but i think his discomfort with the subject matter showed through too much and he allowed his personal feelings to show through too much in the character  i am only hoping that with the second two films he will relax a bit more and know that just because the subject matter isnt his personal cup of tea he is an actor and is playing a role  if he can accomplish that then i have high hopes that the remainder of the film series will be much better
Feb 20 2015,positive,i havent read the books yet but im familiar with the content  the lifestyle the movie left me eagerly awaiting the next installment this is not a movie for everyone as it is a sensitive type of relationship
Feb 20 2015,positive,phenomenali read all three books i was pleased at how well they stayed with the first book for this movie of course everything from the book could not be put into the movie especially all the explicit sexual encounters thats written in book one i say well done and i cant wait for the sequels
Feb 20 2015,negative,a half star and thats generous a crap movie that could of been better if marketed as how young women can be groomed into abusive relationships dressed up like kink pure abuse nothing more shame on universal for feeding into this but hey spencer gifts does promote porn as well and targets teens
Feb 20 2015,positive,i liked it felt a bit rushed and cut but hoping for a better part 2
Feb 20 2015,positive,better  than  expected
Feb 20 2015,positive,people are trying to be politically correct  this was done tastefully and left everyone in the theater looking forward to the next installment dont know where all the naysayers come from but doubt they saw the movie
Feb 20 2015,positive,the movie didnt do the book justice dakota johnson was very good in her portrayal of anastasia steele however i cant say the same of jamie dornan jamie was not a good choice in my opinion not that he didnt play good he just didnt match to description of christian from the book the movie at the begining was moving too fast you couldnt connect with characters like u do in the book the sex scenes were okay but could be better i never felt with this movie what i felt when i was reading the book  it was a good movie but not great but i guess there a limits to what they can put on the big screen  sometimes i think our imagination is better than  those who direct and produce the movie p
Feb 20 2015,positive,absolutely fantastic well donecant wait for 2
Feb 20 2015,negative,a completely unbelievable story terribly written idiotic in its scope and very boring
Feb 20 2015,positive,love love loved it cant wait for the 2nd part
Feb 20 2015,negative,wow all the hype over this
Feb 20 2015,neutral,well i suppose it could have been worse but most definitely could have been a lot better if youre looking for a thrill get it free online maybe its because i dont like boobs haha
Feb 20 2015,neutral,its like a porn but i like it haha 
Feb 20 2015,positive,its not as bad as everybody is saying its better than the books and jamie dornan does a good job portraying the one dimensional character that is christian   its certainly better than hearing james talk about inner goddesses all the time could have been a little more sex driven
Feb 20 2015,positive,i thought the movie was excellent in every since of the word and further more i think those that gave the movie a bad review have either a very dull sex life and or there a bunch of haters cant wait for 2
Feb 20 2015,positive,overall a good movie loved it
Feb 20 2015,positive,much improved anajohnson does a superb job cardboard christian blame it on the script and director dornan wasnt given much to work with expected story to be clipped but some of the clipping changed the story and character arc another twelve minutes could have fixed itshowing him breaking more of his rules for her and making it clear that he sees a therapist sex scenes were hot and beautifully done
Feb 20 2015,positive,they did the best they could to put in the big screen
Feb 20 2015,positive,it was good but as always the book was better
Feb 20 2015,negative,silly characters no story just shock value sm was a bad porn flick we just felt dirty after seeing it
Feb 20 2015,neutral,fifty shades of grey  to its detriment its too hot for prime time and not hot enough for cable it proves the adage that sex sells without it the three part series could be condensed into one two hour made for lifetime movie sparing us the inevitable six hours in the theater to watch all three and lets face now that ive seen the fifty shades grey i have to see fifty shades darker and fifty shades freed for the closure that i didnt get from this open ended set up for the sequel     christian grey is a typea billionaire control freak looking for a part time live in sex submissive anastasia steele is a fresh young college student to naive to realize that she is looking for a relationship from a man who just wants her as a kept woman on its own the movie is iffy at best watch it at home with a bunch of girlfriends drinking cosmos and it could be priceless so watch it if you think you may enjoy the torture if not free yourself of the 1 hour and 50 minute contract to submit to watch the awkward relationship fifty shades may be worth a small bucket of popcorn but pouring three cosmos may help to turn it into the inevitable cult classic that im sure it will be
Feb 20 2015,negative,seriously  this isnt even a good chick flick  dumb story dumb ending over hyped waste of my money
Feb 20 2015,positive,liked how they were so close with the book and loved the music for the movie it was funny on some points but only because of how ana is so awkward and thats how i read the book  dont really know what ppl were expecting from this movie but i liked it
Feb 20 2015,negative,the girl was quite goodhe wasnt what i was expectinghe was a bit woodennot believable as the mysterious christian greyone star for her and the other cause it followed the book fairly wellso sadly there will be another one
Feb 20 2015,negative,stupidest movie ever to grace the screen  what stupidity
Feb 20 2015,positive,i was forced to go see and i ended up enjoying the movie cant wait for the next one
Feb 19 2015,positive,a real chappy film good from start to finish
Feb 19 2015,positive,not sure what all the fuss was about  i thought the film was very close to the book it concentrated on the relationship not the sm but that said jamie dornan is just not my idea of christian grey
Feb 19 2015,negative,the acting was terrible  i didnt read the book but i guess its more explicit i didnt find any of it sexy whyi dont get it but the production was cheap and it was unexciting  to each their own
Feb 19 2015,neutral,a daring movie but it is just simply a romance movie with a twist complicated by bdsm bondage discipline sadism and masochism case i havent read the book written by el james in which it was based on but seeing it in the silver screen it seems to be a pointless plot movie the movie run and ended without solidly establishing the characters of the story especially of christian grey and the real story of the book leaving it pointless and anticlimactic finale of the movie on a good point anastasia steeles character was establish by the movie yet it wasnt enough for its downdragging and mediocre story and christian grey seriously needs a psychiatrist i mean paging sigmund freud or dr margie holmes in the house there are times it was boring because it seems to prolong some parts and scenes that wasnt needed to expand the love scenes actually soft porn scenes will surely titillate viewers as it is almost gracious in letting you see everything but not for those who are not into bdsm but the soft porn theme is not enough to save it from being a shallow story movie and pointless plot unless you like 20 minutes of soft porn even making it openended climax doesnt beg watchers to see more of its installment fifty shades of grey as a romantic movie it is surely a chick flick but as a romance movie yes but it will be hard to appreciate it easily this is mainly because the story has a slow pacing in establishing its premise and shallow plot the film needs a better writing and direction to win watchers favor maybe just settle with the book fifty shades of grey is recommended to fans but not for romantic flick fans
Feb 19 2015,positive,was a decent movie i enjoyed it an ending to leave you wanting to know more the guy is pretty crazy though super weird movie very different but good in its own ways
Feb 19 2015,positive,9 12 weeks was much better more style
Feb 19 2015,negative,so i saw this with my wife even though it looked terrible and wow it was bad  so the few positives were that i liked both dakota johnson and jamie dornan who i also like from the fall on the bbc and even though their acting wasnt great they did well with the given material  also i thought the music was pretty solid and added to the film  besides that there is nothing else i can say good at all  the story and dialogue are basically laughable there is no plot and almost none of the film seems realistic at all none of the characters would ever make the choices they do in real life  overall a terrible film but a positive was that my wife also hated it so i wont have to see any its sequels
Feb 19 2015,positive,awesome movie cant wait for the next one
Feb 19 2015,negative,seriously this is this a lifetime movie made for the screen i mean come on people are your sex lives really that boring and lack passion that this book and movie was the kindle in fire give me break is the only way people can feel free to sexually express their secret sexual desires because a character in a book suggested these wild and passionate sexual experiences the book and movie is marketing genius because it allows women an scapegoat and men to reap the rewards of this new sexual revolution yeah whatever i heard a few lines of the book for free on audiblecom and it was a drag to say the least
Feb 19 2015,positive,followed book perfectly and the actors were great
Feb 19 2015,negative,okay it fails either as a drama or a romance and even if it has a strong message it wasnt worth it i bet even a porn addict would be disappointed read the book which i havent read and imagine whatever is better than the movie
Feb 19 2015,positive,if you read the books youre going to love it if not maybe you dont like it that much
Feb 19 2015,negative,soooo that is what you ladies were clamoring over and people say i like boring movies literally nothing was happening during that 2 hour movie hell we dont even get the first sex scene till 40 minutes in and the first hardcore one till nearly 80 minutes in theres no story the characters make so sense the christian grey character is the most horrible unlikable confusing poorly written character i have ever seen it just baffles me you made this movie over 80 million why
Feb 19 2015,neutral,the movie starts off strong with intriguing characters but actors seem to fail at showing chemistry that the two characters desperately needed  sex scenes literately falls flat and borders on boring at times  lets face it when your whole movie revolves around sex the last thing you want to be dull is the sex  the more this movie rolled the less interested i became  it serves as a time waster and nothing more
Feb 19 2015,negative,does anybody know there are three parts not much sexuality as they promise disappointing
Feb 19 2015,negative,they glossed over all the detail that gave the books the depth and passion way to make a crappier movie than the twilight series
Feb 19 2015,negative,my heart cries for men and women who find entertainment in this film it robs the mind and soul from knowing what is good there is pain in what is shown here too many in our country are being easily fooled by a disguise that looks appealing but is cheap tasteless and ultimately deadly there is nothing funny about this film and all who are entertained by it should repent and turn to jesus he will forgive and redeem you    there is real joy full enjoyment and complete satisfaction in knowing the one who is holy his love is real
Feb 19 2015,negative,terrible movie if i wanted to watch a soap opera i could watch tv if i wanted to watch porn i could watch it online if i wanted to watch abusivewhipping i could watch django lol waste of 2 hours
Feb 19 2015,positive,ashamed to sayi was entertained at least lol fuck u until next weekgreat line
Feb 19 2015,positive,best soundtrack and loved the whole movie
Feb 19 2015,positive,entertaining to watch the directors cut a lot of details from the book
Feb 19 2015,positive,my friend and i thought it was an entertaining twist on a modern love story water cooler talk at work everyone loves it
Feb 19 2015,negative,literally one of the worst scripts ive ever seen married with zero chemistry from the lead roles based on her reactions i am not sure the female actor has ever had sex before jamie dornan was not convincing as a deviant pervert who takes advantage of women to see him in a better role try the fall on netflix where he plays the same thing but is also a serial killer the murder makes all the difference
Feb 19 2015,positive,not the worst movie ive ever seen  cheesy in some parts but overall not too too bad  liked the actors  will see the next two when they are released
Feb 19 2015,positive,i enjoyed the movie very much it was as i expected it would be for those who havent read the books or dont know the whole story it is indeed a love story  loved jamie dornan as christian greyhis eyes and the corners of his mouth say all that needs to be said by the private character he plays   though many who left the movie said they were disappointed the theatre was very quiet and people were definitely paying attention
Feb 19 2015,neutral,ok the acting was a bit lame along with the movie people said it followed the book  there are many better bsm books out there i assume housewives have not read  ending what ending was a bit dissapointed
Feb 19 2015,negative,believe it or not there are good elements in 50 shades of grey that redeem the movie only slightly however as the old adage goes you cant polish a turd
Feb 19 2015,positive,i wasnt expecting much most first movies arent that great but it wasnt bad in all honesty i wish they would have focused more on the love story and went more in to those details reading all three books i had the knowledge but for those who hadnt they wouldnt see or know the whole picture  they left out some key points in their relationship that shows why these two people are actually together i do hope they make the other two books into movies too though because like the books got better with each new one i believe the movies will too they just need to focus more on the love story and less on the sex find a better way to balance it out
Feb 19 2015,positive,excellent did a great job sticking to the same storyline as the book my only complaint is that it ended cant wait to see the sequel
Feb 19 2015,negative,piece of shit movie
Feb 19 2015,positive,a lip biting edge of your seat tale of a forbidden loveso worth the watch
Feb 19 2015,positive,i have not read the book but really enjoyed the film it has a bit of everything glamour humour and sex it was short and easy to watch the cast is understated but hot which made it all the better for me i am looking forward to seeing the next part highly recommended
Feb 19 2015,negative,fifty shades of blueballs  zzzzzzzzzzzzz 
Feb 19 2015,positive,not awful the story was laughable but we knew that going in yet we went anyways
Feb 19 2015,negative,terrible i read all three books and loved them but the movie didnt do a good job with what kind of character christian was or anna the acting was bad and cheesy so disappointed and i loved jamie dorian
Feb 19 2015,positive,the movie was good but not great and here is why if you havent read the books  i would not recommend seeing the movie i read the trilogy three times and understood there is no way to show the complete story 1501 pages in a twohour film so a lot people didnt understand that the movie was only part 1 so right when you are starting to really get into the movie it pretty much ended abruptly and the screen went black it should of stated at that time on the screen part 2 fifty shades darker coming in 2016 universal has thankfully hired a new screenwriter for part 2 im excited about that because book 2 really gets into the guts of the story the characters and why christian grey is the way he is
Feb 19 2015,positive,wowwowwowwowjust seen this movie 4 the 1st time n think that this is an alright movie 2 watch it is nothing special 2 watchits got a good cast of actorsactresses throughout this moviei think that jamie dornan dakota johnson luke grimes jennifer ehle play good rolesparts throughout this moviei think that the director of this romancedrama movie had done a great job of directing this movie because you never know what 2 expect throughout this movieit is nothing special 2 watch but it is an alright movie 2 watchits got a good soundtrack throughout this movie        sequels    at a fan screening in new york city on february 6 taylorjohnson announced that the book sequels fifty shades darker and fifty shades freed will also be adapted with the first to be released in 2016principal photography for the first sequel will commence in june and will return to vancouver          it is nothing special 2 watch but it is an alright movie 2 watchit is more of a girls movie 2 watch it is nothing special 2 watch but it is an alright movie 2 watch its nothing special 2 watchwarning this movie contains strobe lightning effects throughout this movieit is a chick flick movie 2 watch it is nothing special 2 watch but it is an ok movie 2 watch with a good cast throughout this movie
Feb 19 2015,positive,i loved the books and liked the movie it was choppy a lot more at the beginning and i felt like there was so much missing from the book it would be hard to follow if you did not read the books i thought the casting for christian and anastasia was good and felt the chemistry between them what was in the movie was true to the book there is so much more to christian and anastasia that did not come through in the movie i am hoping the  next installment will flow better
Feb 19 2015,positive,romantic movie very well done great casting  cant wait to see the sequel
Feb 19 2015,negative,if youre going to adapt an awfully written book about sexual exploration and have laughable dialogue wooden performances and all round tepidness at least make the sexual exploration which is what audiences and fans of the book have come for interesting deep daring and not hampered by mainstream hollywood executives otherwise it simply wont satisfy the screenplay generates unintentional hilarity particularly when mr grey attempts street style slang george lucas would have laughed this script with this dialogue out of the board meeting  jamie doran is bland and stone faced maybe because thats what his character is but it doesnt make any kind of intense impression that personifies what anastasia undergoes in his presence dakota johnson utilizes her admittedly impressive skills as much as she can to give a solidly nervous and placid character performance but her abilities are aching for a better script to splash out on  its timid weak safe and artistically uninspired like watching a weekend fling between two strangers who we know nothing about progressing into various sexual antics and thenit stops there is no power in the story arc and the ending is such an anticlimax that i felt the need to go and watch lars von triers 4 hour long nymphomaniac to receive the edgy darling arthouse style erotica drama i expected to find watching fifty shades the whole malarkey has an elaborate uselessness about it it appears to serve the fans of the novel an unconfident adaptation one thats so scared to delve into the depths explored by e l james and instead choosing a mainly surface approach and brush away the awful prose the pages were written in whilst the script may read considerably better than the book the film is bland boring melodrama with no lasting impact whatsoever however when next year comes bringing the second book adaptation that may bring the tepidness back to the surface of my consciousness
Feb 19 2015,negative,acceptable humor here and there but overall the script was rather mediocre however got to admit there is an unmistakable spark between the two leading actors
Feb 19 2015,negative,despite a cool soundtrack this is so boring for such a provocative subject matter dakota johnson and jamie dornan have little to no chemistry on screen and the dialogue is either predictable or boring this is less a movie and more of a hollywood cashin on a hot topic
Feb 19 2015,positive,wow great movie my respects to the actors great job
Feb 19 2015,negative,stay away  an awful adaption of the book and only the first one
Feb 19 2015,negative,about as sexy as dropping a carrot into a soggy paper bag
Feb 19 2015,negative,this is the worst movie i has the misfortune to see it is twilight with sex    avoid
Feb 19 2015,positive,excellent ds film very similar to the secretary and the story of o from the 70s jamie and dakota have such chemistry saw it last night and loved it
Feb 19 2015,negative,the score was amazing but if i didnt have a jamie dornan fetish i wouldnt spend this whole time to see a annoying girl thinking that she could conquer and alter the world of bdsm
Feb 19 2015,negative,fifty shades is like looking at a stunning building with its gorgeous cinematography and wonderful soundtrack which you then walk into and see shite dialogue on the floor a morinic story in the corners and at the centre a dreadful representation of bdsm which deserves a violent smack across the arse six times whilst it counts    im not the kind of person who agrees that every film needs to give a positive representation of its subject matter but the message needs to be important many people involved on bdsm are sane people who for whatever reason just enjoy a bit of spice in their life not many dominant people are abusive stalking control freaks with severe psychological issues who would do anything againt the submissives wishes as christian grey is by all means make a film about such people but dont paint it as some messed up love story between two lonely souls    anastacia steele also seems to always forgets how much of a stalker and dick her admirer is when she has a tongue in her mouth or her arse on a plane seat but gets mad when grey spanks her six times which she willfully took part in i guess its okay to stalk and control a woman but smacking her arse six times is taking it too far even though shes had that done several times already or so fifty shades of grey tells us    i dont really need to say more on how stupid it is as everyone knows already but it must be complimented on its music and cinematography the sex scenes also felt somewhat tastefully done where many film scenes involving nude women feel desperate to catch the heterosexual male gaze this did not it was intense and struck the right chord where it could have easily been exploitative which was likely due to having a female director there is also some hilarious dialogue but i highly doubt much of it was intentional but yes theres much better out there so say red and give it a miss
Feb 19 2015,positive,i dont know why people are complaining about the movie i watched it and i was never bored i really liked it it was funny and and dramatic i felt that they did a great job with the casting dakota was incredible as anna in a way i felt that she was better than book anna i did feel that christian was missing something i just dont what it was jamie did a good job after watching him i found my new mcmloloverall i give this movie a 8 out of 10 i really enjoyed it
Feb 19 2015,negative,at this point now the very sentence 50 shades of grey makes me wanna puke so many outstanding movies out there which gettin no recognition at all  and this ultimate piece of human feces makes 265 million boxoffice on its starting weekend planet of the rutting apes how sad
Feb 19 2015,positive,i really enjoyed it  i thought the acting was great as with the chemistry that anastasia and christian had
Feb 19 2015,positive,good movie however the books were much better
Feb 19 2015,negative,more of a love story then what i expected
Feb 19 2015,neutral,fifty shades of grey really isnt all that bad  i do make sure to watch movies objectively as well as independent of what others maybe saying about them already  while the film is targeted at all the women who are so fondly attached to the book its not like this is a typical chick flick that men should be bored watching  i mean its pretty much all about sex  if anything the reason why most men are not interested in this phenomenon is that they figure the story is probably too tame for a book thats supposed to be about kink and sm  the book has been labeled mommy porn by many meaning its kinky in the eyes of the settleddown mother demographic  but its obviously reached much more than that as it has become so huge and the movie itself has been making a tremendous amount of money due to the anticipation of the books adaptation to film    while its maybe not as graphic as some other films its not completely timid either  the main character anastasia steele is told by christian grey right off the bat that he doesnt do the girlfriend thing and he doesnt make love he prefers another term for what he does  it becomes immediately clear that this no love story  grey is a dominant man looking for a woman who will be his submissive  he wants full control of the relationship and for the woman to pretty much cater to his every whim  he even makes out long detailed contracts for his women to sign if they agree to the situation  hes a rich man and must protect himself from any lawsuit  thats how hardcore the things he likes to do to women apparently are  of course the film doesnt show everything because then it would get an nc17 rating and not make nearly as much money  but aside from whatever amount of sex is shown its the characters that really make the movie work  the two stars are not wellknown but they do seem to have a strong chemistry on screen together and carry the entire film  more familiar faces like oscarwinner marcia gay harden and singer rita ora who is literally on screen for about 10 seconds are completely underused  but luckily the main two characters have enough screen presence to make the film watchable  it does however lack the depth of a better film from a dozen years ago called secretary which showed how an smtype relationship could actually be what brings 2 people to fall in love with each other  there really isnt any love here  just more of a strong connection  but its entertaining nonetheless  many women will love it but i dont think the guys will mind it as much as they think
Feb 19 2015,negative,terrible movie there are so many scenes that you can tell are right out of twilight the best part of the whole thing was the fact that in every scene there was something phallic havent laughed so hard at a movie in a long time and that is not a compliment
Feb 19 2015,negative,absolute worst movie ive ever seen read the books thought they were interesting movie was simply awful
Feb 19 2015,positive,i thought this film was fantastic i thought they matched the actors very well to the characters in the book and they built the storyline as best as they could perhaps could have been a little longer but thats my only qualm     well worth seeing
Feb 19 2015,positive,dont understand why people dont like this film i loved it it stuck to the book which a lot of films dont do these days if you thought it was a porno you are completely wrong this film is about the story line not all the sex cant wait for the next one  xx
Feb 19 2015,negative,did not enjoy the film hoped to at least get a laugh at it but i was just uncomfortable the best part of the movie however was dakota johnsons attempt to make it better review her performance and check out my review here 
Feb 19 2015,positive,bad casting for the guy
Feb 19 2015,negative,trying to spice up soft core pulp by hard selling a limp romance this oftentimes dull adaptation of el james steamy novel ends up to be many shades shy of sexy or entertaining at least the movie tries classing up the joint the novels onenote first person prose wants for creativity so bad that it might as well be presenting an emotionless msdos conversation between a computer and user but many readers submitted wholeheartedly to this rudimentary format expectantly awaiting hwood to up the ante of their lurid fantasies with a full tilt boogie bells and whistles er whips and chains interpretation despite coloring in the grey areas by focusing on the courtship backstories of the two pyts and buildup to the sm in the first act the rest plays out like a whimpernot a bang its amazing how a flick with so many supposedly scintillating acts actually ends up to be boring even with all of the hard bodies and spanking no sparks fly between whats on screen and the audience worse moments and whole scenes abruptly just end nothing ahem climaxes its understood that christian grey isnt a romantic but his masochistic acts should at least elicit more than yawns from moviegoers    in this rrated adaptation of the erotic romance novel by el james literature student anastasia steeles johnson life changes forever when she meets handsome yet tormented billionaire christian grey dorman     director sam taylorwood attempts to bring some verve to their dating portion trying to get you invested in these rather colorless characters ultimately however she and screenwriter kelly marcel fail to make the goingson go flush with liveliness dakota johnson seems bound for bigger and better things despite this tourist trap stop in dullsville jamie dorman meanwhile sometimes looks the part but sometimes looks like he doesnt want to be there either    bottom line no spank you maam
Feb 19 2015,negative,worst movie of all time period
Feb 19 2015,positive,amazing when you read a book then watch the film you often feel it didnt live up to the book but not with 50 shades its pretty much how i imagined it i cant wait for the next two which im hoping they make
Feb 19 2015,negative,garbage abuse is not a love story
Feb 19 2015,positive,considering what the director had to work with being honest the books were rubbish the film was not actually that bad  sam taylorjohnson managed to dredge up the little amount of story of this ridiculous book and actually made a reasonably good film out of it  most women dont mind the fantasy but very few women want to see another women being degraded on screen and lets face it mostly women will see this movie
Feb 19 2015,negative,it was very boring and such a slow film i dont see why it was rated a 18there was hardly any nudity scenes it promoted domestic violence within the relationship
Feb 19 2015,positive,thought it was better done than the book not long enough  could have sat through another hour
Feb 19 2015,positive,wasnt near as bad as i expected havent read the book though would rather be dragged to this than a nicholas sparks movie
Feb 19 2015,positive,i think the movie is great it just lacks more scenes between ana and christian not scenes in bed but scenes where they were able to develop their feelings for each other one thing i loved about the movie is that it had a little bit of comedy to it people say that the movie promotes sex and violence but if you really look deep into the movie christian is trying to hold back his feeling for ana and change between lovers today are needed ana and christians love story might be far from other love stories but its about love about changing because of love 50 shades of grey is a movie worth to be watched
Feb 19 2015,positive,i enjoyed it a group of 7 girls all agreed it was a good chick flick we would watch the next one some of us had read the book and some hadnt we all heard it was bad but we were pleasantly surprised worth a watch
Feb 19 2015,negative,for starters fire whoever was in charge of casting neither of the actors were a good fit  there was 0 chemistry i was expecting a ryan philipe in cruel intentions sort of bastard you want to sleep with or a johnny depp in cry baby where the sex appeal in undeniablebut no we needed someone who could pull off the fiery bad boy but this actor just felt like a really nice guy pretending to be a jerk everytime he said an erotic line it came out of his mouth like a cat choking out a hairballit just felt forced  in such a way that i actually accidentally laughed out loud twice during the movie     and now for herim not saying this to be rude or funny but seriously her teeth  his smile were very distractingi get they were going for mousy shy girl but can we make her a little more attractive so we can actually believe he would so drawn to her she wears a series of unflattering awful dresses when they could have put her in conservative dresses that would have still flattered her body but instead shes in a series of dresses that make her look in need of a push up bra she had bags under her eyes the whole time  i kept finding myself distracted by it she could have still pulled off the mousy shy girl look with the simple hair  lack of makeup but letting her look like she hadnt slept in years was just a bad call     next was the music im a big fan of music taking things to another level  this wasnt it every song except for the first playroom sex scenes song was totally off  didnt fit with the tension  excitement we were suppose to be feeling if you want to see a movie that prove how music can intensify  make scenes watch gone girl 9 inch nails did the music or drive with ryan gosling     but nowlets talk about the elephant in the room was this movie made for men  lesbians i lost count of how many times i saw her bush  nipplescan we please see some of him we are heterosexual females watching this btw in case someone didnt get the memo i got more excitement watching forgetting sarah marshall      so heres where i admit that i never read the bookbut instead got to chapter two  couldnt forgive the terrible writing no matter how good the soft porn was promised to be i was hoping hollywood would save this franchise with a better written screenplay  great actors but no i also want to say that i could never act it takes an incredible amount of talent so while im saying how bad these actors were for this movie im sure they are really great in others movies i havent seen    and to summarize it all id say there were a couple good parts i was mildly interested in the first playroom sex scene  not that im complaining becuase i need more kink or graphic sex but i did feel a sincere lack of passion it was just a lot of him kissing her  foreplay for her which is maybe what they thought we would want to see but i was more into him picking her up  making love to her in the airthat was sexy  she also did do a couple scenes where she was shy  i resonated with her as well as him but for the most part its like when you think your going to have great sex but you never quite get there  in the end it was just a lot of work with no orgasm to make it all worthwhile if they make a second one i really hope they make her more attractive throw in a penis shot or two make him more believable as a sexy conflicted goodbad guy
Feb 19 2015,positive,the movie was amazing the chemistry was hot hot and the cast perfect
Feb 19 2015,positive,no matter what other people say about it in my opinion it was good   if you didnt read the book then you know whats going on even though in the book it has more effect   yes i will give you that it was move funny then it should have but the meaning of the book is still there                       the eye of the be holder
Feb 18 2015,positive,loved the movie the acting was awesome  i was very impressed  they were exactly as i had pictured  i thought the movie was very well done  the producers put just the right amount of the dirty in the movie while keeping the romance  i do not think that they took the movie to far  if anything the movie was clean compared to the book loved it
Feb 18 2015,positive,not sure why i am seeing ratings of 510 it was an amazing film honestly i watched it 3 days ago and have already been looking at when number 2 is coming out and want to read the books again and again if you like drama romance and a bit of comedy then youll love it although its more for girls even my partner thought there was much more to it than just a few erotic scenes there is more of a story to it than just sex was such a brilliant film
Feb 18 2015,negative,just watched this movie with my girlfriend on a date im beyond belief how inappropriate christian greys character is in this series hes a manipulative conniving creepy megalomaniac obsessed with his targetvictim the whole notion anastasia a sweet girl next door virgin can transform christian is insane hes a fucking woman beater hes a fucking needy stalker and hes manipulative i feel bad for those whom follow this series thinking its ok for a man to senselessly punish abuse and manipulate women for their gain sure bdsm has its merits and followers but its a fantasy not to taken literally in the real world this movie doesnt follow bdsm by two consenting adults but manipulation and domestic abuse avoid this garbage
Feb 18 2015,neutral,some of this stuff is indefensible i would have bolted once i woke up in a strange hotel room wearing clothes that werent mine and then getting scolded for drinking with my friends by a guy i only met three times that being said there is a weird alchemy going on in this movie that is hard to resist yes his performance is so bad i feel like its intentional his idea of sexy talk is sounding like the creepiest dude on tinder its like dude if you are so embarrassed to be here why did you audition her performance was relatable intentionally funny sweet and practically heroic next to his i would like to respond to the charge that this is some sort of sexual and emotional abuse apologia i didnt read the books but the movie is very consentdriven and pretty sex positive any charge leveled against this movie is totally legit but i think we need to see this for what it is erotic escapism hes not that different than 1000s of romantic leads we have seen thus far and for once she drives the narrative and doesnt serve as the object the real heroes and villains fight over so this movie is silly and pedestrian and times boring but youll find yourself pleasantly surprised at times also she has a little body hair which totally thrilled me
Feb 18 2015,positive,i was entertained by this silly little movie dakota johnson is as cute a button
Feb 18 2015,positive,wasnt as bad as people say get watch iti liked it
Feb 18 2015,positive,its ironic but with fifty shades of grey there is no grey you are either gonna love it or hate it personally i loved it the sex scenes were graphic yet classy and pinnacle to the book which was also strongly followed i was impressed by the performances of the leads and fell in love with the music
Feb 18 2015,negative,this movie is crap
Feb 18 2015,negative,i cant believe im about to say this  twilight was better
Feb 18 2015,negative,just as awful and garbage as the book that only the lowest type of people would enjoy would have been a perfect ending if the series didnt have sequels christian grey is an awful character and person and jamie dornan portrayed the character awfully while ana was a likable and real character wonderfully played by dakota johnson though the two have worse chemistry than kristen stewart and rob pattinson in the twilight the soundtrack is also perfectly used and it is well filmed if it was for johnson and some of the technical aspects id rate this much lower
Feb 18 2015,neutral,neither particularly good nor particularly filthy it should have picked a side still it has its moments
Feb 18 2015,positive,great movie could have had a little more from the book but loved the actors especially dakota
Feb 18 2015,positive,i was not at all interested in seeing this movie but a friend of mine made me go with her on valentines day i was not impressed with dakota as anna at first but as her character developed especially with jamie as christian i really began to appreciate the casting jamie did a wonderful job of capturing christians infatuation with anna dakota played a very believable intelligent but naive young woman she was cute sexy and witty the movie didnt strictly follow the book but i dont think it needed to i was expecting a movie that was based on the book not one that followed it to a t the story is fascinating the sex is passionate as passionate as a rated r movie is allowed to be and it leaves you wanting more i dont think this movie will be taking the oscars by any means but it is thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining give it a chance and go into it with an open mind
Feb 18 2015,positive,50 shades  3 stars  5
Feb 18 2015,negative,quite possibly the worst movie i have ever seen and i have seen a lot of bad ones the story line was long drawn out and bored you to tears the chemistry between the 2 actors was non existent not that the books were any good either but the screen adaptation was horrid i would never recommend this movie to anyone and wont bother seeing the sequels if they are even dumb enuff to make them i would have given it a 0 star if it was possible
Feb 18 2015,positive,casting was very intriguing good acting sometimes a little awkward but music was perfect even had direct book quotes ended alright with a cliffhanger
Feb 18 2015,positive,my wife and i loved it she read the books and i didnt the world is just too cynical about this movie its different unique exciting
Feb 18 2015,positive,an intense love story breaking boundaries and keeping you on the edge of your seat wanting more jamie dornan raw sexual energy jumps off the screen and dakota awkward charm makes you adore her pleasantly surprised
Feb 18 2015,positive,i liked the book better
Feb 18 2015,negative,dragged on way too long
Feb 18 2015,neutral,this is a weird moviegoing experience its rare and awkward to see so many things bustling and fighting underneath the surface of a film while the actual film is just totally bland and boring although we did just recently see another one of these rarities in january with american sniper ive not read fifty shades of grey i do know its based on what began as twilight fanfiction and evolved into whatever we want to call it  most call it mommy porn or garbage  so it is but here is something rather unique whereas most hollywood films take a praised novel and turn it into garbage examples are vast and vary  see child of god hannibal the hobbit etc here we get a universally bashed trilogy of books and find the filmmakers attempting to make it into something better something more this is really a commendable trait i cant judge this movies based on the novel but i definitely sense something more in the movie something more as in perhaps a leveling down of sex and an increase in character development and story arc only the thing is none of it happens or succeeds whatever sam taylorjohnson was working for here falls completely flat theres actually some definite talent and potential though and thats what harms this movie so jamie dornan is a great actor as those that have seen the excellent underrated netflix series the fall can attest to here he shows no range whatsoever and delivers his lines and actions with total blankness christian grey is supposed to be an interesting titillating character  in this movie he is not seductive in the slightest dakota johnson sort of shines here but still falls short of what potential there is here is a character that is innocent signified with a heavy hand through her virginity but has the same curiosities and desires as anyone else  as most virgins do she enters into an interesting awkward somewhat frightening situation when she meets and falls for christian grey who has acquired tastes for some brutal love whats supposed to be a sexual awakening in the character of anastasia steele as described by author el james ends up simply being a negotiation of power in a somewhat abusive relationship there is certainly no sexual awakening here but im in no way inclined to say that type of subject matter is dead as some critics have reached in saying after seeing fifty shades  just look at the recent blue is the warmest color or wetlands this is a film marketed as a risky sexy film it is not there are many risky scenes of conversation about bdsm and only a couple scenes featuring such material but its all handled so lightly and with no intention to explore any themes the film is open to exploring it all becomes a bit unsatisfying and laughable the highlight of this film is the sleek greytoned cinematography by seamus mcgarvey i found myself entranced by the look of this film but repulsed by its bungling of already bungled material  its like seeing a glossy lustrous brand new aston martin and opening the doors only to find nothing inside void of any interior whatsoever so while this movie actually boasts some serious talent it does nothing with it while this movie actually tries to lift bad material out of the muck it fails while this movie actually makes money other better movies dont i dont recommend fifty shades of grey unless youre into awkwardly long romance films that carry no serious conversation about love and sex and no conclusion whatsoever seriously theres actually no conclusion to this movie  it ends in the middle of whatever kind of story its trying to convey while i give it bonus points for really trying i cant deny how bad it is
Feb 18 2015,positive,my updated review of this iconic masterpiece i love this movie  i dont care what you think  im a gay man and i love mommy porn where people think nipple clamps and rope is kinky  bitch please  that is basically going to first base in the gay world  unless there is triple penetration on a spindle at steamworks with a various assortment of poppers at your disposal this is merely foreplay but whatever i still love this movie and im buying it on bluray
Feb 18 2015,positive,they did a really good job adapting the book into a movie i was very skeptical having been a big fan of the series they did the sex scenes very well they were a perfect middle between normal chick flick sex scenes where the sheet is moving and just their heads are shown and a porn it showed just enough but not too much the actors portrayed the deep emotions that you pick up on from the books if anything the movie depicted morea deeper romance than the novels were able to convey i cant wait for the sequels
Feb 18 2015,negative,as a science teacher i am very concerned with the dumbing down of america and these books and movies prove my point the majority of our population no longer cares about quality in music tv movies and books what seems to be popular anymore are not even close to quality productions we are a nation of oversexed morons who have lost the skill or joy of learning education takes a back seat to entertainment because americans only care about pleasure instead of hard work i do not know what the answer is but we are headed to being a third class nation
Feb 18 2015,positive,pretty much same as book but without the following books it doesnt feel finished i hope they finish because the last book was the best
Feb 18 2015,positive,i thought the movie was really good a romantic with a twist
Feb 18 2015,positive,not bad all the sex scenes where the same
Feb 18 2015,positive,based on my own opinion and the 85 of the people who saw the movie and read the book knows that the movie was supposed to be exactly as it is they also took out some scenes from book that were extremely strong so i think that people shouldnt be talking things without knowing where the story comes in the second book everything starts to change christian changes so theres no problem with the movie or book because at the end the book ends in a great position so i give five starts to this amazing movie great job to sam taylor
Feb 18 2015,negative,if you are a teenaged boy you will probably like thisif not you will likely find it incredibly inane    then again where else will you see samuel jackson lisping and im pretty sure snoop d in a crowd scene and colin firth in a stupid plot    not sure if they were going for the so bad its memorable thingbut they sure got there for us
Feb 18 2015,positive,some things are better in your imagination  the movie is true to the book and i really felt the struggle of both characters at the end of the movie  my only real complaint is that the actors portrayl of christian left me wanting  i would watch the next one
Feb 18 2015,negative,simply awful most boring 2 hours of my life
Feb 18 2015,positive,better then i expected
Feb 18 2015,positive,the first book was my least favorite so obviously the first movie wouldnt be the best because it hasnt captured the real meaning and aspects of their later relationship yet the movie couldve been more informative and gone into depth but i still enjoyed it and cant wait for the second and third i feel they will be better than the first mainly because the content is just all around better i love the soundtrack
Feb 18 2015,negative,a very monotonous cristian what a disappointment
Feb 18 2015,negative,theres almost no reason to write anything about this movie everyone knows its bad the real question is it as ridiculous and sexridden as everyone hoped it would be the answer is both yes and no the movie begins gloriously with anastasia steele dakota johnson meeting mysterious entrepreneur christian grey jamie dornan in the most sexual tensionlaced scene ever he offers her a giant pencil she rubs it on her lips he smirks its heaven later they meet in a hardware store and he asks her where he can find some things  namely cable ties masking tape and rope wow she says youre the complete serial killer at the screening i saw the audience was in fits of laughter and applause for the first forty minutes  basically on a rocky horror level once the sex started happening though it went downhill the fact of the matter is that this movie shouldnt have been r director sam taylorjohnson and team credit must be given to both of these actors doing yeomans work make an immensely satisfying first act many argue that it isnt intentionally funny i tend to think they absolutely knew what they were doing but either dont have the courage of their convictions to up the ante as the story progresses or were straitjacketed by the mpaa regardless only one whip of christians thousands gets used and the energy very quickly fizzles after the foreplay is over this shouldve either been a ridiculous campfest or an offering to horny grandmothers everywhere as it stands its both and neither and thats just kinda lame
Feb 18 2015,positive,love christian grey more than ever 3
Feb 18 2015,positive,it was tastefully done and followed the book people shouting all the hype and boycotting it need to get a life
Feb 18 2015,negative,bueno  this is meant to be erotic
Feb 18 2015,neutral,after some long thought about this film ive finally decided how im going to review this let me start by saying that this film doesnt fully represent its original erotic source material ive read a couple segments of the book online and the book is way more raunchier the film removes content to make it fit a showable r rated film so all the people that are against seeing this based on that reason alone can calm down because its not crazy bad this film is not pornography the nudity is tasteful and filmed elegantly its a film that is focused on its story in which the nudity is just a supporting part of the story like titanic her gone girl and wild the reason why people should avoid seeing this is for the abuse that the main character gives to other main character in this movie and to avoid having it being replicated in real life    now to address everything else this film has a very fast pace the lighting is good the film features color schemes of grey throughout the film the set design is great and music scoresoundtrack is excellent actor performances arent ground breaking but are alright the story however is weird and leaves a strange taste in your mouth you dont figure out why things happen and the film ends abruptly forcing you watch the next film to find out what is going on i dont necessarily like this film but i dont hate it its a film that looks great but has a weird story this film will be remembered for its hype more than anything
Feb 18 2015,negative,how a movie about sex can be so boring is unfathomable
Feb 18 2015,positive,followed the book quiet well i enjoyed the story was good to watch
Feb 18 2015,negative,wow what a disappointment from the reviews of friends  that went to see it they liked it truly disappointing  wrong choices for both lead characters no real chemistry right from the start   wait till it comes out on dvd
Feb 18 2015,negative,the movie is pretty lame no fear for mr grey in the movie
Feb 18 2015,negative,the movie was so bad terrible acting leading actress and i felt a completely waist of my time the book was far more interesting and entertaining no way i will watch the following ones if they are stupid enough to make any other
Feb 18 2015,negative,fifty shades of grey is a complete waste of time its nothing more than a twilight clone the only main difference is that its not about vampires and werewolves its disrespectful to women everywherehow well it basically says   that women cant support themselves and they always need a man who can take care of themand even though this isnt exactly donestic violence as i expected from what people told me i can see why people would think it is domestic violence because christian grey is completely possessive he stalked her and verbally abuses her
Feb 18 2015,positive,great movie sexy fun and has a lot of meaning to it its more than just what people think of it acting could have been better but when the second movie comes around itll get refined
Feb 18 2015,negative,when did he have time to do his job so successfully
Feb 18 2015,negative,they missed to much of the background content like in the book i was not impressed and will no twee the next 2 movies i think they should shave made it a longer movie since a lot of important items were excluded big waste of time and money read the books they are so much better
Feb 18 2015,negative,i dont know what was so great about christian grey he is a crazy individual with creepy fetishs granted many affluent individuals are bat shit crazy but come on a smart woman falling in love with a man with no personality and a lot of money who offers you a contract to be his sex slave in return for his devotion to you no love just fucking fucking hard to be exact well since you put it that way sign me up stupid
Feb 18 2015,positive,besides the movie being a little uncomfortable at times the overall picture was pretty good it was entertaining and that is what you want from a movie obviously the ending was a shocker but if youve read all 3 books you know they will most likely follow up
Feb 18 2015,positive,i thought this movie was actually pretty good when watching the movie you sure cant go with expectaions in it because that will make the movie shitty i read all 3 books and i have to say it was very intense funny and good one thing i dont understand why the critics are so bad but at the end its your opinion i give this movie 5 stars because it deserved it acting those scenes out take a lot of encouragement and i give props to that
Feb 18 2015,positive,ive read all the books  they are not works of art they are not even wellwritten or welledited but what they do offer is some really steamy scenes and a look into a lifestyle that most regular people havent even heard about    i was excited about the movie but i was concerned it was just going to translate into a bad porno  because lets face it the book doesnt do a great job at character development  and the story itself is very flimsy    what a joy it was to see such a wellcast wellacted welldirected movie that was quite beautiful and sexy visually and had a great sense of humor the book didnt have these qualities      i can see how this movie is being pannedit doesnt have much substance  and christian is a morbid grumpy character  he should have been more charming but wasnt  and this is what i dont get  jamie is sexy and charming as heck and he does some sexy and charming things in the movie  he just didnt come across the same way as he did in the book  regardless if this is the fault of the actor director or screenwriter  or all three for that matter the one thing that redeems it is that dakota is perfect as ana  and since the original story is from her perspective i think they set out to achieve what needed to be achieved    i just feel grateful that this movie wasnt a bad porno and that the red room scenes were tame  it allowed me to enjoy the characters themselves without being distracted by the other stuff    i want to see it again and i want to see the sequels  i love all the actors cast and i cant wait to see more of the others
Feb 18 2015,positive,acting wasnt the best but im sure those roles arent easy to play its a lot like the book hopefully the next two sequels will be better
Feb 18 2015,positive,i watched it last friday and im still figuring out if i like it or bah it is funnier than the book and i think this is a good plus for the movie but then they change and omit so many important things  just to be clear not erotic not even a bit ive seen more action in got or true blood    about the actors i like how dakota plays ana she is funny and sweet and jamie could try to be a little bit more passionate angry desperate overprotective some times it looks like he did not give a dam about anas well this is not jamies problem ive seen him in the fall and i know it is not him is the script and the director for asking him to do it more audience appropriate    and this brings me to the script problem the book is dynamic lot of things going on and lot of feelings around the characters but at the end everything makes sense while with the movie im sorry but i spent the second half of it asking why did they change the order of the book the graduation the move to seattle dont get it and it annoyed me and distracted me from the rest im a little bit ocd    i think they did not try hard pun intended with the script they knew they would make millions of  just for the spectation of all the readers and the curious people    conclusion i liked some parts of it way more romantic than sexual it end up being a little bit awkward and funny but i think the book is better better balance and that says a lot we all know this is not shakespeares material i liked dakota and jamies chemistry and i was surprise by dakotas approach jamie is phisically christian but the feelings are missing that hand running through his hair desperate
Feb 18 2015,negative,the acting and plot is laughable i laughed during most of the scenes because it was so bad and so did the rest of the audience the only renewing trait about this movie is the soundtrack but even beyonce and the weeknd werent enough to help me write a nice review if you want a boringly hilarious soft core porn film about a filthy rich crazy stalker and a weak minded virgin fifty shades of grey is the right movie for you
Feb 18 2015,positive,i read the books they were soso i found anas character lacking in just about everything  i liked this movie it was done better than the books but yet followed them just right  people who are freaking out about the film have issues  its just a movie but now theres all these movements to stop battered women and such  yikes i think we should be more ashamed that spongebob is doing so well in theaters when it has been proven that children watching that show have more problems and harder times learning than a movie about consenting adults  the ending will move perfectly into the next and for those who havent read the books the dynamic of their relationship changes vastly through the next two books  americans the outspoken ones anyway are a bunch of uptight prudes who cant handle anything a little risqué  say what you will you wont change my mind a freed open mind who can see past whatever hangups the rest of you have  i will buy this movie when it comes out i will watch the upcoming sequels  by the way there are way way more kinkier books out there some on the library shelf romances are more sexually heated than this
Feb 18 2015,negative,the worst movie from a book i have ever seen it was ridiculous
Feb 18 2015,positive,i must say 50shadesofgrey wasnt all that the sex scenes were short lived the soundtrack was weak as well as the intensity of the scenes to the point where the ending wasnt very satisfying but it could have been if the rest of the movie was on point one of the songs in the movie from beyonce was supposed to be in part 2 which really makes no sense on why they would put it in part 1 so whoever was directing this movie had  poor judgement and made somewhat bad decisions the girl went from being a virgin to pro sex slave overnight which wasnt so bad except for the lack of intensity when i think movies based on love romance or anything that resembles love im expecting to catch an erection during the movie such as i did with the movie the boy next door when jenniferlopez was getting fucked and even the notebook 50shadesofgrey was way too long to have had very little intensity and they cut out most of the parts that were in the book all it really did for me is give me new ideas on what to do and how to play with my girlfriend                                     ãâãtmâãâ
Feb 18 2015,positive,the books are so much better i think the movie would be much better if they would of picked a better cast the over all was well put together
Feb 18 2015,negative,fans will only like this rubbish movie
Feb 18 2015,negative,this movie is repulsive as were the books and as a woman i am offended that it is teaching young women that an abusive relationship is love
Feb 18 2015,positive,i enjoyed it everyone has their own opinion
Feb 18 2015,negative,my wife laughed her way through it
Feb 18 2015,negative,terrible as expected just like the books painful to watch only gets half a star because jamie dornan is very hot
Feb 18 2015,positive,i read the bookthought it waa good until i saw the movie the movie was awful watchable though think this was rushed the acting good the sex scenes were poor you saw more in sex and the city anyway 35
Feb 18 2015,negative,this movie was horrible i thought i was pretty open to it but i was angry by the end i felt like i was watching a young naive woman being abused  i would not recommend it to anyone
Feb 18 2015,positive,i was pleasantly surprised by how true the movie stayed to the book little surprised at the disappointment expressed by manyif you read the novels then you knew what was going to happenthe actors were better in these roles than i thought they would be all in all while not oscar worthy still a decent movie
Feb 18 2015,negative,this film is not by any means a great filmit should never win an award or receive critical acclaim so in that sense it did exactly what i was expecting but better i like to perceive that the first act is supposed to be an exact parody of twilight the story from which fifty shades started out as a fanfiction of this gives purposeful reasoning to why there is forced chemistry between the leads as well as why dakota johnson appears to have such a difficult time expressing any emotion however by the third act i was on the edge of my seat no longer dreading the 2 hour runtime of the film the actors seemed to be more intouch with who their characters are supposed to be and the story became much darker and less superficial than its first act ultimately this movie is destined to become a cult classic and deserves it
Feb 18 2015,positive,great movie great song
Feb 18 2015,negative,this way very upsetting the book is way better total waste of money so disappointing
Feb 18 2015,positive,i didnt have high hopes because books made into movies are never as good as the books but this one stayed pretty true to the books it was intense and kept me focused through out the ending was a heartbreaker but it ended the same way the book did so i dont know why i was so shocked i just didnt want it to end my husband even really enjoyed it which was a real surprise for me all in all it was really good but it definitely made more sense if you read the books
Feb 18 2015,negative,in this era where pornography is easily accessible a shallow commercial picture about bdsm can only be a big tease dakota johnson is the naive virginal undergrad who interviews a billionaire jamie dornan then obsequiously becomes a submissive to his sadomasochistic desires the writing is banal the dialogue is atrocious the acting is flat and its visually drab the sex scenes are shockingly tame  impersonal and without eroticism it is no more provocative than one of those late night madeforcinemax movies with shannon tweed it couldve been a camp exploitation classic like showgirls if everyone involved hadnt taken the material so seriously for a more honest depiction of bdsm watch secretary instead based on the critically derided but phenomenally popular book unread by me by el james written by kelly marcel and directed by sam taylorjohnson which only proves that women can make movies about sex just as ineptly as men a hit at the box office though the audience i saw it with groaned at the unresolved ending
Feb 18 2015,positive,im still trying to process 50 shades true to its title it is  seen differently  by each person though  we say all is fare in love and war there is a standard  by which we judge 50 shades was no rape movie as i was told it was  a cleverly portrayed story of sexual  experimentation and yes  evolution on both the part of the man and the woman each taking steps toward each other  curious about this new feeling of love
Feb 18 2015,positive,i loved the movie  it was very very close to the book  i personally didnt think that dornan nor johnson were right for the parts  but after seeing the moviei was wrong now they would have had to nc17 the movie if they had gone by the book  but sam taylorjohnson did a great job with an r rating
Feb 18 2015,positive,more like a 35 star simply because of dornans acting but dakota actually surprised me the depth of the character she created melded the rest of the story together she embraced ana wholly and the result sold the rest of the movie    the supporting characters were well defined and precise as well marcia gay harden was excellent as was kate her best friend now the end brought an abrupt ending that can only be explained with a sequel which i know was their goal     now as a fan of the books i have to say they remain true to the storyline i will definitely see the concluding movies if not just for the dialogue from the books but i feel that they will get better and be a well oiled machine when the next flick comes out    just my humble opinion
Feb 18 2015,negative,who did this movie disney i see more sex scenes and body parts on fx  lame next to the book 
Feb 18 2015,negative,actor was a terrible fit to play christian grey  movie very disappointing should have left it as book series
Feb 18 2015,positive,i thought the movie was great  i have never read the books but just purchased them to read  i had very low expectations going into this given the bad reviews but was pleasantly surprised how much i liked it  is it a chic flick  yeah it is  does it have a good mix of romance laughs passion and mystery  hell yes  i cant wait to read the books and see the next two installments when they come out    btw  i created an account just to review this movie since i feel all the negative reviews are unjustified  i wasnt expecting to go watch some academy award winner but this is a great date night or girls night out movie
Feb 18 2015,negative,i think this movie should be redone if you didnt read the book you were completely clueless to what was going on in the movie they left out so many important details that were in the book and they werent sexual at all it really disappoints me that they left out about 34 of the book the preview made the movie seem like it was going to be the greatest movie of all time instead it was such a disappointment i hope if they make sequels that they are a whole lot better then this movie
Feb 18 2015,negative,it sucks everything sucks
Feb 18 2015,negative,utter  garbage not really  a surprise
Feb 18 2015,positive,was not into it at all saw it with wifey for entertainment and it was that entertaining not going up for any oscars but it was fun to watch i will see the following movies too it wasnt horrible
Feb 18 2015,negative,i thought the movie was very cheesy with poor acting not good
Feb 18 2015,positive,the film was highly expected following the worldwide success of the series of book about the intriguing young wealthy self made christian grey as always with material based on a popular book the film will divide trigger and create a few debates personally i havent red the books and didnt read much about the film i went it with no expectations first of all i would praise the esthetic of the film which displays an interesting range of greys it may not be the kind of details most people will go for  but visually speaking it gives the film an amazing texture and sets the mood of a film clearly looking and feeling like the mind of the main character its a fascinating crafted film where colors and atmosphere play a huge part on the setting of the story some scenes especially the one where sitting at a table and facing eachothers in mr greys office bathed in a deep orange  redpink the two protagonist review the contract in  a scene that manages to be both incredibly erotic and funny  it seems we are looking at a magnificent sunset created inside an office sam taylorjohnson is a very smart woman and has made a film as good as she could from a material that isnt in the end very substantial but will appear provocative and new to a whole group of people whos sexual life isnt thrilling or daring personally i couldnt care more about the story stories have all been told already and if you look into literature for example im sure some authors such as the marquis de sade would win the grand prize of daring controversial  subjects in a far more glorious way than this one now that being said what i enjoyed with this film is the journey of anastasia she is far more intriguing interesting and appealing to the audience than mr grey she accepts to enter a universe she doesnt know and willingly explore her sexuality unfortunately for herself to a man whos so prisoner of his own habits he may very well be losing it all and pass next to happiness without even noticing it the names of the characters are giving it away he is grey she is steele not so subtle but efficient with the relationship dominant dominee i always felt that the dominee somehow ends up possessing the dominee far more than one would expect and i was very glad to see this on screen few people might actually get it but if you think about it it makes sense anastasia accepts to explore she is thus opening her fan of possibilities in life and becomes extremely stronger than christian grey because she is obviously smart and possess values grey on his side is very much tributary of his passion desires and ways which makes him the real prisoner the real dependent one the film will appear first as a huge sexist and bias vision but i am convinced there is more to it and some subtleties will pass unnoticed for most of the audience its a mature look at the exploration of love and sexual desire done in an interesting graphic way but i would say that in the end the story feels a little dull n over dramatic to fully convinced if grey had been willing to exchange places every once in a while and make anastasia the dominant the film would have been far more interesting like the recent roman polanskis venus in fur an amazing twisted study of malefemale relationship and who truly dominate in the end but i may be anticipating the next two books who will certainly be turned into films in the near future following the epic record of popularity at the box office america with its usual complexesfrustrations regarding sexuality may find something to chew on for a while with such material to resume its a film that will either reach you and intrigue you or will plainly annoy you and bore you to death as with all things in life there is two ways to look at it if not more and it will be your choice to see in it what you want to see
Feb 18 2015,positive,great movie story line could have followed the book better  but still worth seeing 
Feb 18 2015,negative,absolute failure director camera actors  couldnt be worse than this no chemistry between actors no passion no chills but plenty of cheap clichés like biting pencils lips the worst movie ive seen in years
Feb 18 2015,negative,the spongebob movie has better ratings just saying
Feb 18 2015,negative,i absolutely loved the books and was very excited about the movie the excitement turned to disappointment though the movie didnt do the books any justice at all and while yea the movie cant be the same they left so many of the important parts out you didnt see the struggle they had throughout the book dakota didnt capture ana at all and jamie was ok as christian the movie was just hey i just met you and i want you to be my sub and ana just said ok without any explanations or struggle and all the other characters were just fillers instead of showing how important they actually were horrible horrible disappointment
Feb 18 2015,positive,very well done version of the book given that it is rated r
Feb 18 2015,positive,this movie was superb i dont understand where everyones angst is coming from except perhaps this movie wasnt their cup of tea then dont watch i found it profoundly deep funny and eccentric it tested the limits and brought the audience to a much riskier place than any other movie this is a first in its class no one knows about bdsm and this is bringing it some light you dont have to be into itbut dont condemn it either i love it cant wait to own it and i might go watch it over and over it was close to the book as it could be and yes it felt a bit rushed in the beginning but thats with any storyline brought from a novel to the big screen go watch it and keep your mind open 
Feb 18 2015,negative,basically boring  corny i have read the books and liked them but i just laughed the whole time during the movie the acting was not great she laughed or smirked during every sex scene and i saw enough of dakota johnsons boobs to last a life time the movie skipped over a lot of the stuff that i felt was important and had scenes that had nothing to do with the book at least i know dakota could do a comedy movie
Feb 18 2015,positive,surprisingly good  intense mystery and strong passion combining   more thought provoking then expected
Feb 18 2015,negative,one of the worst movies ive ever seen
Feb 18 2015,negative,just terrible im usually someone who likes terrible movies i went and saw all the twilights but this was something else theres no build up no tension everythings awkward half the movie is incredibly depressing after one of the erotic scenes she cried her eyes out and says hes never allowed to do that again then she leaves credits roll women get off to this stuff at least the porn i watch is sexy and doesnt make me cry
Feb 18 2015,negative,this was the most disappointing stupid movie i have seen  the book is horribly gross and the movie was horrible acting and did not follow any important seens in the book  they would have been better off making a porno movie with real porno actors to act out the missing scenes in the movie than try to make a family valentine movie out of fifty shades of crap
Feb 18 2015,positive,well heres the review youve been waiting for im going to go against the tide and tell you that fifty shades of grey is a good movie i agree with one reviewer who suggested that if the movie was in french and had english subtitles the critics would probably be raving about it i dont know why so many think this is a bad movie  maybe because they were expecting it to have as much sex in it as the books  it doesnt fortunately the director sam taylorjohnson has stripped away the poor writing of the book and produced a film that is worthy of a viewing    the dialogue between christian jamie dornan and anastasia dakota johnson is more intelligent and witty than the book there is quite a good sense of humour portrayed by the two as they develop their relationship anastasia is intelligent confident and in control of herself and the situation in fact dakota johnson is superb in her role giving us a nuanced performance with emotional depth jamie dornan slowly develops his character as he is challenged by anastasia resisting his attempts to control her while yearning for a normal romantic relationship anastasias character develops nicely over the course of the narrative the soundtrack is good with contemporary songs supporting the story the cinematography by seamus mcgarvey the avengers atonement is excellent    in my view fifty shades can be seen to reflect much of what women experience in traditional marriages  particularly conservative religious marriages the husband as the head of the household wants to control what goes on while women are told to submit to their husbands in order to find true happiness and freedom the difference in the movie is that unlike many conservative religious marriages the woman can say no and leave the relationship easily seen from this perspective fifty shades is actually a critique of this form of relationship ill leave viewers to think further on this if they wish    fifty shades is a smartly provocative  story with a stunning finale that leaves us hanging waiting for the next instalment if the second episode does as good a job of stripping away the cringeworthy aspects of the books it will be worth seeing where the story goes
Feb 18 2015,positive,loved it stuck to the book but obviously a bit condensed jamie dornan is certainly my mr grey
Feb 18 2015,negative,horrible absolutely horrible rapeish not sexy
Feb 18 2015,neutral,given the horrible dialogue during certain scenes and sometimes the actor has an accent slip it wasnt that bad the two have more chemistry then the fan fiction its based off of and has decently edited scenes to reveal some but not all a movie that sets up its soon to be following sequel no doubt
Feb 18 2015,positive,this film felt very rushed it lacked the romance and understanding of why she falls for him while dakota johnson added a lot to the character of anastasia jamie dornan had no lines the actors did what they could with what was given to them as for the sex scenes in the film it honestly wasnt bad at all there are racier scenes on television very interested to see how they do with the next two films
Feb 17 2015,positive,it was a bit fast some scenes are added but i like it i cant wait for the next one to come i hope it will be a bit longer more sweet scenes please
Feb 17 2015,positive,this movie was great if you have not read the books then you can not appreciate the movie just like any book that is turned into a movie some scenes are left out and details are left out there is no way of finding an entire novel and silly movie that is only one hour and a half long this movie was great
Feb 17 2015,negative,it was mediocre highbudget softcore porn film i never read the books but people told me about them if its anything like this wow it really wasnt that good of a movie better off just as books but it did have a few humorous parts to but thats it
Feb 17 2015,neutral,the movie was mediocre there was no character development  the acting was bland and the only scene that was hot was the first kiss  i am someone who thuroughly enjoyed the books but the movie adaptation evoked no more than a spec of the feeling and passion that the book possessed jamie  dorian was great to look at but thats about it
Feb 17 2015,negative,im not impressed at all she was pretty he was okay he didnt feel as charming as he was described in the book it was a lame erotic movie maybe what i needed fine to watch and think about the book but quite unnecessary
Feb 17 2015,neutral,the plot as a reminder to all my female friends n sisters whenever you bump into a young good looking successful wealthy guy and want to screw him he might have a singular taste to stay that way and you prepare to pay it off there is no free lunch and dont be too naive that true love will melt or change in this case a sex maniac who like punishing all women as a revenge to his drug addicted sex worker his real mother i do hope there will be a sequel to this movie to clarify my initial perception    the movie im quite disappointed with vision experience as a movie talking about sex i expect more arousing sex scenesactions maybe a male director will do a better job on this part or a different pair of christian anastasia  as well
Feb 17 2015,positive,dont know why getting such poor reviews the movie was great and loved the cast dakota was adorably awkward and jamie was a great grey im looking forward to the next 2 films people are always finding something bicker about or complain dont compare the book to the film let the film have its time to shine the books already had their time shut up and stop hating and enjoy the movie
Feb 17 2015,negative,what can i say its a terrible movie its boring and very poorly written a lot of strange silences i only lasted 45 min before i binned it    id rather watch joel schumacher batman and robin and boy is that film st
Feb 17 2015,negative,worst movie about sex ive seen
Feb 17 2015,negative,terrible representation of how a relationship actually works
Feb 17 2015,positive,i liked it  i thought the movie followed the book and actually was better than the book for setting up the scenes  the grey character was intense but also vulnerable it kept my attention the whole film
Feb 17 2015,positive,as a fan of the written trilogy i was overall pleased with the movie  i believe dakota  jamie did an amazing job bringing ana  christian to life i wouldve liked to see christians character a bit more developed so for that i blame whomever wrote the screenplay  i hope the 2nd and 3rd installments are made into films as well
Feb 17 2015,positive,better than expected cute boy love story
Feb 17 2015,positive,the only thing missing was the acting and execution with the limits of having a film ratedr the film was entertaining enough to get the idea dirty yet classy
Feb 17 2015,neutral,actually not awful but i couldnt possibly call it good the film enjoys the moments when it can sift through the sex scenes but it also makes a statement about the moral righteousness of the behavior dakota johnson is wholly likable lifting the hugely silly dialogue to relatively believable heights dornans performance is just there and cant quite be picked apart overall i didnt hate or like the film but it certainly isnt as bad as i was anticipating just be prepared to roll your eyes quite a bit rating 49
Feb 17 2015,positive,i think this movie is underrated and the only reason why that would be is because they didnt read the book first or they read them and they just didnt like it if youve read the books and liked them youll absolutely love the film it sticks to the story and the actors do a fantastic job i couldnt of pictured a better ana or a better christian
Feb 17 2015,negative,took the wife to see this on her birthday i have never read the book i found there to be little to no chemistry between the 2 main characters the storyline was lacking and that is being kind for me the movie was to long and boring how anyone finds excitement in this film is beyond my comprehension the theatre was not packed but it was monday afternoon just after opening weekend i did see at least 1 group of at least 10 women a few couples and interestingly a single man sitting alone nearest the screen my wife almost dozed off a few times as did i hoping to see hot tub time machine 2 pretty soon as its got to be better than shades of grey
Feb 17 2015,neutral,watch it as a comedy and you will have a decent time
Feb 17 2015,negative,more like two and a half shades of wack how the film managed to be worse than the book is an absolute fucking feat
Feb 17 2015,negative,after seeing this movie i dont only want that hour and 50 minutes of my life back but i also feel like i should get an extra two hours of my life back on top of that the leads seem to have barely any chemistry the writing was god awful the sex scenes were cringe worthy at best and the story jumped around way too much to even enjoy it or find the plot the only good thing that came out of seeing this movie in the theaters was the fact that there was some good movie previews before it started this is probably the worst movie ive seen in years and i say that after watching all the twilight movies which after seeing 50 shades id rewatch twilight happily with a smile on my face and enjoy it
Feb 17 2015,negative,this was the worst movie ever
Feb 17 2015,positive,i think people are being a little too harsh on this movie yes it may not be the best movie out there but they stayed true to the book and true to the fans and it delivered i would say almost perfectly both the characters are exactly how i imagined them and it brought the book to life if you did not read the book or read it and didnt like it then it is understandable to see why you would not like the movie with that being said this trilogy is more than just a guy who has sexual problems and psychological problems there is more behind it and there is an actual story to follow the next two books bring in that story and give more depth into the characters honestly if you gave it a chance you would be able to see where i am coming from other than that i love the books and hope that there will be two more installments for the movie the fans would be extremely happy
Feb 17 2015,positive,this movie is incredible i loved the whole series and the movie is great at first i didnt think these two actors would look for the part for what i had conjured up in my mind but after watching it i realize they fit the part perfectly very impressed with the acting and cannot wait to see the next film
Feb 17 2015,positive,they did what they could and they did great
Feb 17 2015,positive,wow it was really close to the book which was great
Feb 17 2015,positive,lets be honest this movie wont be winning any oscars corny dialogue at times wooden acting by jamie dorman and over the top sex scenes make this film nothing but a guilty pleasure but what a pleasure it was if youre willing to turn off your brain for 2 hours surely you will enjoy this funny romantic and enjoyable film im fifty shades of hooked and will be eagerly awaiting the next installment of this series
Feb 17 2015,positive,the movie is just like the book its not amazing and not the best story plain and simple its a love story with a lot of sex the movie and the book are both same if you are realistic about what youre going to see its good i will go see it a second time and see all the movies that come out for the trilogy
Feb 17 2015,negative,first of all i want to say i loved the books i couldnt wait for this movie to come out and now that it has and i have had the chance to watch it i want to say that it did not follow the first book that well dakota johnson was a horrible pick she is supposed to be playing a 21 year old virgin and college student and she looks like she is in her 30s ad does not have the innocent girl next door look that they portrayed in the book and jamie dornan again another horrible pick he is supposed to be this dark super handsome business man which i pictured to be in his early 30s not 18 he does not have the dirty backward personality that the character n the book plays they should have used ian somerhalder as christian grey and alexis bledel as anastasia overall i was very disappointed in the movie and i hope they decide to redo it
Feb 17 2015,negative,about what i expected
Feb 17 2015,negative,i always remain in the theater to finish the credit list except the crappy ones that i bumped into once in a while i did the same with fifty shades of grey just to punish my extreme taste of bondage
Feb 17 2015,positive,seriously i dont understand why all those people are complaining about if you did not read the book youre not going to understand the movie is awesome i cant wait to see the second part third or fourth
Feb 17 2015,negative,boring bad plot awkward to watch
Feb 17 2015,positive,i absolutely loved this movie it was perfectly balanced with funny and sexy clearly the people giving bad reviews either have no sex life or no sense of humour i am already excited for the second part to come out
Feb 17 2015,neutral,with better actors and a better script talyorjohnson could have knocked this out of the park unfortunately she was handicapped from the start by the stigma surrounding the source material forced to make the best out of a poorly adapted script
Feb 17 2015,negative,poorly written poor acting it amazes me that this was published and became a best seller let alone a now box office success its degrading to women and people in general
Feb 17 2015,neutral,it could have been more intense the movie was not awful but it did let so much to wish
Feb 17 2015,positive,i went in with a very low expectation and was pleasantly surprised    i think both leads played their characters very well having read the book i was able to understand what the actors were trying to convey i thought it was very emotive it was interesting to see an unlikely man fall in love and see on screen the anguish he goes through as he is pushed out of his comfort zone equally anastasia is an unsuspected virgin who pushes herself to the limit for a man she barely knows but is drawn too  its sad that this story is overcrowded by peoples views that all this has to offer is the not soo radical sm sex scenes
Feb 17 2015,negative,i need it is exhausting killing so many brain cells so quickly
Feb 17 2015,negative,havent read the book went with 5 other women who had to my surprise they all seemed much more impressed with teh movie than me i thought the story line was dull and found myself quite bored apart from laughing at the corny lines and random scenes which i would liken to soft porn  there were no the book was much better   comments from my friends so perhaps i just didnt find the story line that good i actually just found the main character grey to be disturbing and the female character depressing basically just a romance with some soft porn thrown in
Feb 17 2015,positive,all these people who are so against this movie are so stupid this movie is a fiction novel they are portraying fiction characters and fiction circumstances the love story is beyond magnetic you see a man who has gone trough a really rough childhood and now as an adult is sick anastasia is her cure they did an amazing job with this movie and is making way more than all of you will ever make so all of you need to take several seats
Feb 17 2015,positive,obviously not as much detail as the bookâ but i loved every minute of it   definitely going back to see it in the theater a couple more times 
Feb 17 2015,positive,for someone who only watched the movie i loved it very creative intenseand sexual also the ending surprised me so i cannot wait for the next one to come out
Feb 17 2015,positive,i enjoyed the books and i wish there could have been more a and i also enjoyed the movie  around of 
Feb 17 2015,negative,this was the worst movie i have ever seen in my lifeit has no plothonestly cant understand who let this get releasedi would have rated it a 0 but it wouldnt let me
Feb 17 2015,positive,i loved it and so did my bf i am now starting the book
Feb 17 2015,negative,50 shades of boring  might have left had it not been for the gratuitous nudity  did like the ending however
Feb 17 2015,positive,it is not citizen kane however it is exactly what its  supposed to be acting was a lot better than expected and directing was clean i was surprised
Feb 17 2015,negative,an infinitely more sexist version of twilight only with bdsm or the ridiculous twisted idea that e l james has of it in lieu of vampirism but of course with another lowselfesteem heroine and a gorgeous domineering and overcontrolling stalker as her phallic object of desire
Feb 17 2015,positive,i think jamie dornan christian grey is a great actor though he should work on this american accent and though the movie lacks in actual sex greys brooding intent makes up for what we dont see its along the lines of passion that lies in the eyes of mr darcy colin firth in bbcs pride and prejudice
Feb 17 2015,negative,so boring drags and pushed the romance that wasnt there
Feb 17 2015,negative,all right friends ive endured the suffering so that you wont have to unless you already did in which case i have nothing but pity for you this film has absolutely nothing to recommend it unless youve never seen a womans breasts but seeing that if youre reading this you have internet access that should take care of that i did giggle throughout the entire movie because the things the characters say and do are so hilariously ridiculous that one can do nothing but giggle as absurd as everything in this movie is the film takes itself 135 seriously jamie dornan takes his role more seriously than cancer and would someone please get dakota johnson some chewing gum before she gnaws that bottom lip off sheesh even the scoresoundtrack is completely off     oh and erotic or arousing pffffft not even close and the bondage material is very vanilla its so painfully obvious that this is descended from twilight
Feb 17 2015,neutral,nothing like the book it was straight forward with no build up the movies left a lot of the sexy out which i come to enjoy while reading the series not what i expected the opening scene which sets the tone and the foundation of the movie was a let down
Feb 17 2015,negative,fifty shade of grey is dry  the male lead actor seems impossibly uncomfortable in his own skin  his facial expressions are over rehearsed and non convincing  his movements are awkward and clumsy  he does not come across as a force to be reckoned with  part of the first scene with him shows him slouching in a chair  very unimpressive  after awhile the female lead becomes boring  i get that she is supposed to be shy but when it would seem like a scene would require more strength from a voice or an action it is never achieved  the film as a whole requires the music and as usual danny elfman delivers to carry it because neither of the two main actors can seriously convince the audience that they could do anything more than just walk through their job  marcia gay harding who portrays the mother truly adds no more to the character then to just simply be seen on the screen  the roommate and brother that are suppose to get together is so glossed over that you wonder why they even had a part  this is what we get when they take a poorly written book and attempt to milk out a few more pennies but can give you nothing better than what was in the pages
Feb 17 2015,negative,worst casting worst movie so disapointing
Feb 17 2015,negative,acting was horrible script was stilted chemistry was non existent sex scenes boring boooooringggg heres a butt theres a butt here he is pulling his shirt off again to show off his chest here she is arching her back as the cameraman yet again zooms in on her rib cage and breasts my boyfriend left saying i have never been so unexcited for a movie slated to be a soft core porn and i agree we were ready to leave 45 mins in people were laughing in their seats and the movie didnt follow the book closely enough entire scenes taken out salvaged 1 star for a decent soundtrack albeit weirdly placed sometimes and okay cinematography this movie earned way too much hype and money for what its worth 25 tomatometer is way too generous and if there is a sequel i will not be seeing it in theaters if at all
Feb 17 2015,negative,i thought this movie was really creepy and was just really boring
Feb 17 2015,negative,as titillating as a contract negotiation between a crocodile and a sack of boiled meat
Feb 17 2015,negative,fifty shades of meh    i dont know why but i feel compelled to give my fivecent review of this movie yes over the course of yesterdays observance of valentines day i saw it and yes i went with a beautiful woman who is was at this point a huge fan of the books but it was actually my idea to go    i havent read the books and the likelihood of that ever happening after seeing the movie has dropped to zero but i am a huge film freak from the most exploitive splattergore horror to the cheesiest romantic comedy i can set aside my preconceived ideas and beliefs and appreciate and embrace a movie for what it is  as long as it is done well and with passion i can celebrate hellraiser with the same aplomb as i do 12 years a slave i just love movies i was fascinated by the idea that a movie that has been mercilessly eviscerated by critics all over the world could still make more than 80 million at the box office in its opening weekend what would such a celluloid dichotomy look like    i wanted to love fifty shades of grey that didnt happen    warning spoilers ahead like it even matters    the plot as if you live on pluto and dont know already   a billionaire who happens to be an enormous douchebag seduces a beautiful and demure virginal college student in the hopes of tying her up in his play room and doing all sorts of sm silliness to her he uses lines like i dont do the girlfriend thing and wants her to sign a contract consenting to whatever she falls in love with him really no shit he might be falling in love with her but he cant admit it to himself inner turmoil ensues he whips her ass with a belt six times she gets mad and leaves the end    the characters   dakota johnson does an okay job as anastasia i sort of liked her but i didnt believe her i do not buy that a hot young woman who can pound booze the way anastasia does has remained a virgin until her senior year in college maybe the book conveyed it better ill never find out  from what i hear christian grey is an emotionless tool in the book if thats the case jamie dornan did a fine job playing an arrogant onedimensional prick for all his billions grey is a bore of a man with the personality of a pissedoff door knob i just couldnt make myself care about this guy however he does have great taste in cars    the sex  lets suffice it to say i have seen more chemistry in 30second internet porn clips than i saw in two hours of these two nimrods playing coital cat and mouse folks if you have seen the crap that passes for porn on cinemax after dark what i call the hallmark channel with tits you have seen all you are going to see here the later sex scenes in the movie watch like what a middle school educational film on sm might look like moans ropes thrusts handcuffs and whips are served up with a steaming pile of who gives a shit is this movie over yet dammit i see hotter action when my girlfriends dog humps a throw pillow    bottom line  some of the dialogue is funny intentionally or not other than that meh if you go be sure to take a book just make sure its not one of the fifty shades books     out of 
Feb 17 2015,negative,absolutely just an aweful movie nothing like the book
Feb 17 2015,positive,follows the book  i really enjoyed film wasnt expecting it to be good though but was surprised 
Feb 17 2015,negative,50 shades of why the hell am i watching this is a film that should be praised and commended for its remarkable ability to make sex and bondage boring the incredibly dull performances of jamie dornan and dakota johnson left what were packed theaters almost empty by the second half of the film the fact that this movie has seen so much success in ticket sales is beyond ridiculous seeing as it evokes about as much lust as amish pornography
Feb 17 2015,positive,most of the actors were as i imagined when i read the books and i enjoyed the movie   i think they could have picked a hotter actor to play christian grey
Feb 17 2015,positive,i liked the movie and thought it stayed true to the book looking forward to 50 shades darker
Feb 17 2015,negative,50 shades of grey a film about male power and idealizing emotional abuse as sexy when it very obviously isnt
Feb 17 2015,positive,instead of basing this off of some kinky plot like the book was it gave it more of a romantic flair to the movie  it was great  cant wait for the sequels
Feb 17 2015,neutral,i seem to have been missing 49 shades because this was very one dimensional to me  i felt like this must have been a very watered down version of what was in the book because i cant imagine people being that excited about this  it just came across as boring and there really isnt much of a story at all  its not a terrible movie but its not very good either
Feb 17 2015,negative,really really awful youve been warned
Feb 17 2015,positive,liked both actors in this interesting having not read the books   not as shocking as i thought it would be
Feb 17 2015,negative,horrible horrible movie
Feb 17 2015,positive,yes it was slow but i think the actors did very well portraying the main characters  i really liked the chemistry on the screen and jamie is just adorable
Feb 17 2015,negative,trashy movie for trashy hard up people no substance or flow a coworker couldnt sit through the whole thing and left dont waste your time or money
Feb 17 2015,negative,the movie was to rushed and important parts were ignored they tried to cover to much in 2 hours it was supposed to be a love story and it only focused on sex they didnt even show her changing him yell like the last 2 mins rushing it made it look so corny they probably woulda did a better job if they did a part 1  2 verses the whole book all in 1 movie
Feb 17 2015,positive,given the source material i think the director did a wonderful job of bringing it to life very close adaptation if a little partial on the nudity part due to the ridiculous censor ratings but cant blame them if they wanted to reach a larger audience
Feb 17 2015,negative,ok this movie sucked spoiler alert curious virgin girl meets mysterious billionaire bachelor he sudeces her she gives her virginity to him shows her wat he does she tries doesnt like it freaks out they break up fin
Feb 17 2015,positive,great movie if you enjoyed the books
Feb 17 2015,negative,a lot of titties but not enough snatch and i wasnt impressed with her not getting fisted i payed 575 for this horrible porno that had the worst ending also i wasnt able to jack off in the theater which also ruined my day i got yelled at by a mom with her children now im mentally depressed and the ending had me depressed and confused about my sexuality i would not recommend this movie to anyone
Feb 17 2015,negative,i understand the movie cannot be exactly like the book or we would be looking at an xxx rated movie but i was really disappointed it was boring
Feb 17 2015,negative,the movie has no plot  its not as juicy as you would think  take out the sex scenes and a couple f words then its a pg13
Feb 17 2015,negative,that this has even been allowed to be made into a film is shocking simply put its an abuse story that tells young girls that they ought to allow themselves to be physically and emotionally used and hurt in the search for love it cannot be saved by the money poured into this production or the until now decent actors they somehow managed to convince to take part just awful
Feb 17 2015,positive,i absolutely loved it some people may find this type of movie to be too visual but if you knew anything about the book you should have expected it this was a change from any happy ending love story that anyone else always expects
Feb 17 2015,negative,seems more of a soft porn all about abusing women smdh 
Feb 17 2015,negative,the worst movie i ever see
Feb 17 2015,positive,i was ready to see more when it ended abruptly
Feb 17 2015,negative,what a slap in my face as a woman no wait as a human being never read the books and went with my gfs and my god what a horrible movie terrible script terrible acting if ana bites her lip one more time save your money waste of time and money and i think they just set the womens rights movement back by about 20 yrs truly the worst movie i have ever seen
Feb 17 2015,negative,did not read book found movie rather boring
Feb 17 2015,negative,not what i expected at all
Feb 17 2015,positive,it realky wasnt bad guyspeople complain that there is no story its all sex blah blah well if they had read the books thats the story lolother than that i have to admit dakota was actually a good anastasia at first i was like why did they pick her but she was awesome but anyways go watch it
Feb 17 2015,positive,this film has a lot of hype surrounding it and a lot of people voicing some very negative opinions the key to remember is that its based on a book whatever issues people take to the content should have been voiced at the book not the movie this movie dials down the sex scenes quite dramatically and attempts to give story and some level although granted not much to wooden characters visually very impressive with an amazing soundtrack everyone knows what 50 shades is about if you dont like the content dont see it
Feb 17 2015,positive,a favorable performance but the movie seems to suck at some parts then turned to comedy but still an awesome motion picture to watch with your loved ones
Feb 17 2015,negative,horrible not worth the 2 hours i wasted watching it
Feb 17 2015,negative,the books were great but the movie didnt capture the romance piece i think the actors and directors did well up until she wakes up in christians hotel room everything after that was downhill the directors leaned towards the sex aspect rather than catch the little things that made readers fall in love with the book the directors left out all the quirky comments anastasia makes such as i used your toothbrush and im wearing your underwear and they left out how christian remembers her favorite tea some may think these arent a big deal but to most they are because it shows the type of person christian is i understand that they couldnt make it exactly like the book but if you make a movie where the viewers cant fall in love with the relationship between ana and christian then the movie wont be a success i hope they take into consideration what people are saying and mix it up with the next two
Feb 17 2015,negative,i never read the book and now i wish i had never seen the movie i actually found it quite boring i couldnt wait for it to be over
Feb 17 2015,neutral,excellent movie and very good acting
Feb 17 2015,negative,reminded me of twilight i kept waiting for some mythical creature to jump out nope just scenes upon scenes of heavy breathing and pathetic acting 1010 do not recommend
Feb 17 2015,positive,a wild romantic story
Feb 17 2015,negative,still better love story than twilight  no acrually its exactly the same love story as twilight only with bdsm  whos fault  readers and audience of course youre reading trash youre watching trash and this is what you get box office 94 milionsnice work people
Feb 17 2015,negative,it is the consumers fault that this film got made but seriously there should be a point where terrible movies cannot be released    also why would you hire someone whose a model not an actor
Feb 17 2015,neutral,fifty shades of grey is a movie that i frankly believe did not need to be made nor should have been made at all the book is very racy and graphic from what i hear and it is virtually impossible to make a movie out of a bdsm torture porn concept without giving it an nc17 rating the problem is of course that if the movie was rated nc17 it would have precluded anyone under 17 from screening the movie thus reducing ticket sales the end product here is a mediocre film with a flat lifeless script that most likely doesnt measure up to the book i dont think many viewers would feel stimulated to read the books after watching the movie adaptation the acting is not all that bad the actors just have nothing to work with and the movie never feels as compelling as it should be most of the porn is watered down and tame which doesnt have nearly the effect its supposed to the film has a hard time getting going and ends on a cliffhanger that feels rather awkward for an ending i cannot say from a stylistic standpoint that i enjoyed this movie at all while the connection between anastasia and christian feels real the film feels devoid of any purpose at all the whole film is greys attempt to seduce anastasia and strip her of any individuality or identity at all he wants to own her in every sense of the word and create total repression for her both emotional and physical the fact that this film didnt work should send a sign to the director not to produce the next two films  c
Feb 17 2015,negative,i want my money and the time i lost watching this back
Feb 17 2015,positive,great film the whole cinema loved it  the numbers dont lie
Feb 17 2015,negative,seriously did teenage write this
Feb 17 2015,positive,it was actually really good i mean parts of the script were kinda corny but theyre straight out of the book my husband and i thought it was done very well great acting great cinematography very tasteful we were definitely drawn into the movie i recommend it just dont expect an academy award movie
Feb 17 2015,negative,melodramatic and not a true representation of bdsm blech
Feb 17 2015,positive,hot but they played it safe next to 9 12 weeks this is a romantic comedy they should have pushed the envelope a lot more
Feb 17 2015,negative,only watched this shit because people keep saying you cant say a movie sucks without watching it ok it sucks watched the online version since im not wasting 10 on a movie that promotes this type of thing im just really against bdsm and all the things with it
Feb 16 2015,negative,despite having everything to become a guilty pleasure fifty shades of grey is a boring mediocre erotic romantic drama
Feb 16 2015,negative,there is definitely a certain degree of character development in the film that is worth searching for but the film is largely driven by sexual tension unfortunately this intrigue only works for so long in a 120 minutes motion picture its effect wears off rather quickly fifty shades of grey certainly lacks story and interest jamie dornans performance is dull much like his performance in the fall on the other hand dakota johnson is the true shining star in the film perfect embodiment of both sexy and innocent making her a perfect cast for the film
Feb 16 2015,negative,literature student anastasia steeles life changes forever when she meets handsome yet tormented billionaire christian grey
Feb 16 2015,positive,a good adaptation and perfectly cast could of been improved a bit as jamie was not as intense as christian should be but overall a worthwhile film for fans of the book
Feb 16 2015,negative,filthy shades of grey is yet another falsely advertised movie that gains money and success on the fact that it represents a love storywhen in reality is about a very introverted girl who falls for a very rich business man and entrepreneur mr grey and starts having very intimate and sexual intercourse with with endless dull and cheesy conversations and unwarranted sex scenes fifty shades of grey is a bdsm feature that promotes the fact that young girls should hop in and have sex with the first rich guy they meet horrible and simply obnoxious the movie simply does not deliver a romance story worthy of seeing on valentines day or any day for that matter
Feb 16 2015,positive,if you liked the book youll like the movie as long as you dont take it seriously obviously not going to win any awards but still a fun way to spend two hours
Feb 16 2015,negative,one of the worst movies ive ever seen it was so awful it made me laugh
Feb 16 2015,negative,when your climactic scene is a spanking you know your movie is in trouble
Feb 16 2015,neutral,wasnt what i expected its like twilight for adults
Feb 16 2015,positive,not as great as the book they left a lot out and did some things different but it was still a good movie the music was phinnominal i wasnt too pleased with the casting either
Feb 16 2015,positive,i thought it was a good movie
Feb 16 2015,negative,most boring sex ever
Feb 16 2015,positive,everything the book should have been
Feb 16 2015,positive,for all of the bad reviews they did a wonderful job of showing the delicate balance of what we present to the world and who we truly can be when the door closes
Feb 16 2015,negative,really gals really
Feb 16 2015,positive,great movie its a must see
Feb 16 2015,negative,i like many men took my wife to see this and couldnt wait for it to end terrible dont waste your money
Feb 16 2015,positive,i havent read the books but as a movie alone i found it intriguing to be honest   i would definitely go to see the second film to see what happens
Feb 16 2015,positive,i had never read the books but i decided to go see the film with some of my girlfriends i was pleasantly surprised on top of being super sexy it had an interesting plot and funny at times to everyone saying it was basically porn you sou apparently havent turned on cable tv recently i have seen much worse aitting at home watching very popular tv shows it was fun and a nice escape from reality i will definitely be reading the books now
Feb 16 2015,positive,as far as the book goes the film was perfect people who didnt read and like the books shouldnt be rating its basically a romance novel they are cheesy just the way it is i think the casting was near perfect and probably difficult what with needing actors who will do what they did for this i wish they hadnt rushed it so others could really understand that she was twitterpated by him she wanted all of that in the book he wasnt a stalker showing up asking for rope to kill her and i think el james should have the the director do her job not keep it word for word that leaves a big lack of depth you need filler some disappointments for sure but i give 4 because i will definitely be seeing it again and the sequels
Feb 16 2015,positive,i think this movie is great the acting is superb but what fascinated me the most is the authors ability to depict how some men treat women in a relationship some men dont cherish a women or appreciate the love a woman can give i can easily relate to anastatia in the movie i believe in true love  sex should be nice and kind
Feb 16 2015,positive,way to long and doesnt give any back story of characters
Feb 16 2015,negative,oh my god i came in with low expectations but somehow this movie still surprised me with how awful it was  the dialogue seemed like it was written by a freaking 14 year old  jamie dornan is non that good looking sansbeard and he is not the menacing protagonist he was hyped up to be  his lines were delivered awkwardly and his american accent was terrible  like seriously he kept on going back to his irish accent  there was the sm scenes but nothing really crazy or out of the ordinary as one would expect  the dialogue between the two can be summed up with why cant we be a normal couple its just how i am  the entire movie built up to the climax at the very end of the movie which was really underwhelming and then nothing happened  just a terrible terrible movie
Feb 16 2015,negative,to be honest i caught the last few minutes of the film so thats all i can critique from these few minutes i was able to come to this conclusion im glad i went to see the kingsman instead and let jen see this one alone fellas take it from me unless youve got to go with your honey to see this film dont bother with it and if a woman ever tells you begs you assures you that she wont judge you or claims it wont matter whatever it is she wants to know shell understand dont fall for it its just like when a woman says she doesnt want anything for her birthday she exclaims dont worry about it dont waste any money on her dont believe it get her that gift no matter what thats just what happens in this film someone should have been careful and mind the old saying be careful what you ask for you might get it
Feb 16 2015,neutral,fifty shades of slow  romantic  very little actually mostly he doesnt make love he fucksand hard  sexual  again a little there are more explicit movies out there  and there seemed to be too much cat and mouse  the acting was decent but nothing to get excited about  the whole point of the movie was to sign a god damn contract what the hell  to be fair though it doesnt deserve a rating lower than a 510  and the movie was shot nicely  overall way too overhyped and it had a terrible ending
Feb 16 2015,negative,only reason it is getting a full star is because it made me laugh so hard at being a parody of itself loved the book so much and yet was confused the whole time whether they intentionally made it that bad please do not make the other two movies save some dignity and retire
Feb 16 2015,positive,going into this movie i had a lot of trepidation but i was wrong for feeling that way this was a good movie i thought the plot was good and the acting was good i think this movie had a lot of plot and not much conflict i believe thats coming and the next movie in the series should be more conflicting between the two its worth going to the movies and checking what the hype is all about
Feb 16 2015,positive,people dont give this movie enough credit it has humor and even if it is a soft porn film it is extremely good it shows mr grey cannot leave anastacia alone even if he wanted to he shows he cares but is very scared to let anyone in it is a great movie regardless of what anybody else thinks i really enjoyed it
Feb 16 2015,positive,enjoyed the movie despite the film being a high concept romance it was a good representation of the book well directed and great acting by johnson and dornan
Feb 16 2015,negative,awful adaptation of the book would not watch again
Feb 16 2015,positive,movie was awesome it stayed as close to the book that it could in a 2 hour period of time anybody hating on the movie obviously didnt read the books and those critics shouldnt even be heard cant wait for fifty shades darker releasing march 2016
Feb 16 2015,positive,perfectly brought the pages of el james book to life thought the acting was fantastic and portrayed the characters perfectly recommend seeing great work
Feb 16 2015,negative,one of the worst movies i have ever seen  terrible plot development terrible character development bad ending  wouldnt waste 1 on redbone
Feb 16 2015,negative,justhorrible perhaps the worst movie i have ever seen i mean its important to understand that there is zero story here if you are going to see graphic sex scenes in a big room with a lot of other people this is the perfect movie for you
Feb 16 2015,positive,really enjoyed the movie
Feb 16 2015,positive,i loved it screw you movie review people
Feb 16 2015,negative,i understand the books were popular but the movie fails to deliver  characters are empty plot is shallow the sex lacks purpose and ultimately there is no meaning or resolution  ultimately its just highgrade porna swinging and a miss in my view
Feb 16 2015,neutral,the soundtrack was the only good thing in this movie its better than the booklol i read the first one only though
Feb 16 2015,positive,cant wait for sequel
Feb 16 2015,positive,honestly the movie was good the only thing that got me about the movie was all the air time that anas chest seemed to be getting and no shots of christians front area at least let us see it once compared to the numerous times they show anas chest also at the end how it ended was a real cliff hanger type of move i do admit the humor that was in the book did show up on the screen i also wish they would have showed more of anas dad and more of the family dinner over at christians parents house other than that it was pretty good
Feb 16 2015,positive,awesomeeei love the relationship between the actors its just amazing
Feb 16 2015,negative,a literal pile of trash
Feb 16 2015,negative,porn for middle aged woman lonely middle aged woman  anastasia beaverhausen and christian steele  seriously  file this one under when bad things happen to bad books
Feb 16 2015,positive,i really liked this movie i dont know why everybody is hating on this movie maybe its because i havent read the book but i really liked this movie although the ending had me confused a bit but thats minor four and half out of five
Feb 16 2015,positive,both leading actors are very good i was pulled into the story and the visuals not for prudes or children for sure
Feb 16 2015,negative,worst movie of the year actors are wrong for this movie and all around everything is wrong  big disappointment
Feb 16 2015,negative,where to start  the acting woeful for the most part it seemed like the cast were quite literally just reading out the words on the script well if you can call it a script  most of dakota johnsons dialogue wouldnt look out of place in a lovelorn teenagers diary whilst ironically the scriptwriters strangely random referencing of the works of thomas hardy belies their own standard of writing which falls somewhere between that of loaded magazine and the daily star the sex scenes range from the banal to the downright hilarious and the only redeeming feature of these disjointedly ubiquitous clinches is that the protagonists stop talking the storyline is the same fifteen minute stint recycled and repeated to featurelength preceding a mercifully but bewilderingly abrupt ending believe the antihype this is truly desperate fare
Feb 16 2015,negative,great after the book this will cause a a new surge of freak sex accidents urologists  especially those in the emergency rooms  will love this
Feb 16 2015,negative,daily soap operas are more steamy  terrible cast  needed a hunk like a 007
Feb 16 2015,neutral,while i was looking forward to emotionally provocative movie it evoked the wrong type of emotions not only was it fast paced but it jumped from scene to scene without much room for the story of the budding romance therefore the romance id hoped for was left out and i was frankly disturbed by the bondage i felt badly as usually this is a mutual type of pleasure for those who enjoyed that sort of thing but all i saw was pain and that left romance out completely
Feb 16 2015,positive,way better than expected  well acted  the critics are wrong  not sure what they expected but after reading the books and waiting for the movie im more than satisfied and a new fan of dornan  wow
Feb 16 2015,positive,interesting barely but brings you into their world a bit better than barely
Feb 16 2015,negative,a pointless drag nothing shocking mediocre story and direction you see harder sexual material on a fx network show
Feb 16 2015,positive,so i have now seen 50 shades of grey twice now and throughly enjoyed it both times even more so the second time     i understand that the first time you watch a film you can kind of still enjoy it even if its terrible due to the fact that is the first time you are watching it the second time i watched it i was consciously thinking whether i was bored and i wasnt i was always engaged and enjoying it to be honest the films pace is a lot better than a lot of films there are no unnecessary scenes things are just constantly happening  and never stopping the plot is always moving forward or giving a humoroussexy scene contrary to popular belief i believe the humour is very intentional and was impressed how it balanced serious and comedic scenes     how do i explain the plot in a family friendly way boy meets girl boy wants girl in his playroom which for clarification does not have an xbox in and that is all i can really say     those scenes had two very beautiful people that yes had me hot under the collar i didnt feel i could review it without briefly mentioning them    as far as the ending goes i can understand people feel it is a bit abrupt but it definitely leaves you wanting more and at a turning point in the story    the acting in this film from the two leads are terrific and more on point than i think people realise     lets start with dakota johnson she is clearly the star here and it is a joy to watch her grow as a character there is a great arc to her character and she portrays it beautifully i am really looking forward to seeing more from her in the sequels and other projects     now as far as jamie dornan goes i cant believe how much abuse this guy is getting for his performance the main argument is that his acting is wooden this is deliberate and on purpose and you can see that this is how the character is at a very basic explanation without spoilers he is a very closed book character but all that being said towards the end of the film he does actually show more emotion and i know he can act because he was great in once upon a time     50 shades of grey has beautiful cinematography with perfect angles and lovely colours it has a very clean and sleek finish that fits the film perfectly    the director sam taylor johnson knew exactly how to direct the actors in each scene understanding and portraying the scene clearly to the audience    i love the soundtrack to this film it has been stuck in my head since i first saw it even right this second and again fits scenes perfectly    i had so much fun with fifty shades of grey and would happily see it many more times and am very much looking forward to the next one
Feb 16 2015,positive,overall not a bad movie however did they have to play the same piano tune from twilight and play it over and over throughout the movie composer should be taken out back and shot
Feb 16 2015,positive,bit cheesy but it was not as bad as i thought
Feb 16 2015,negative,not worth your time left early
Feb 16 2015,positive,far better than expected hard genre to tackle erotica and one that certainly hasnt been touched upon in such detail in movie history having not read the books or being at all interested in the franchise i found myself captivated for the 2 hour duration by two weirdly endearing actors in jamie and dakota not the greatest film youll ever see but its one that will certainly encapsulate a lot of people the soundtrack should be singled out as being particularly good
Feb 16 2015,negative,this flick really gave me a lot to think about  1 cleaning out the garage  2 start preparing my tax papers  3 are there enough snacks in pantry for the kids lunches for school tomorrow   4 picking up the dog poo  5 book my dental and medical appointment  etc  it really gave me a lot to think about long after watching it
Feb 16 2015,positive,movie was fantastic so much more then just sex its a love story about a man who needs to be taught how to really love
Feb 16 2015,positive,a superb book to screen version  i loved loved loved it
Feb 16 2015,positive,ok so here are my toughts on fifty shades of grey the movie i have a lot to say so bear with me  i loved the book to movie adaptation overall the movie is basically just like the book there were a few scenes that had to be left out but there was no way they could translate the entire book into the movie let me remind all of you that the book is a little over 500 pages and the movie is only about 2 hours long obviously they had to cut a lot of things out including the blue string scene that im sure a lot of people are aware of in my opinion they cut out many of the scenes that were considered controversial   the sex scenes were tastefully done sam taylorjohnson the director did an excellent job with this movie she made it very tasteful and easier to accept this film could have gone in a very bad direction but thank god it didnt    dakota did an amazing job of portraying every facet of ana she was confident awkward shy and funny all at the same time   i am a huge charlie hunnam fan  i was upset when he backed out and doubted at first jamie being casthowever after seeing the movie jamie is christian he brought the stiff standoffish cold older in manner than years christian from book 1 to life i could see his struggles with realizing he actually felt real emotions about a woman the struggle with changing for her staying away from her honestly after watching the movie i cant see anyone else as christian or ana  i know that every woman has her own sort of envisioning grey and its normal to be disappointed but it does not give them the right to talk bad about him because he did his part excellent in book 2 fifty shades darker christian really starts to evolve and we learn more about him and i cant wait to see jamie bring fsd christian to life  im done so go see it especially if you like the book
Feb 16 2015,positive,i thought it was welldone and was totally intrigued the story and the acting were really captivating never read the bookknew the topicbut was much more impressed than i thought id be
Feb 16 2015,negative,justoddly boring stupid characters and its an abusive relationship not a bdsm relationship should have stayed fan fiction
Feb 16 2015,positive,loved it roll on number 2
Feb 16 2015,positive,i hope the dvd has the missing detailed scenes
Feb 16 2015,positive,loved it i feel that they stuck to the book as much as they could while still keeping the movie classy as far as literature goes the book was kind of a turd but i loved the story so happy to see the story improved upon with talented actors 
Feb 16 2015,negative,this movie was a waste of time and money so next time i will just see a porn movie that will make more sense that this crap made for sycophants
Feb 16 2015,positive,holy mother goddess this was never meant to be a gone with the wind type of classic but it ticked all the  boxes on my entertainment scorecard
Feb 16 2015,negative,oh my you get it i was ripping my hair out and yelling at the screen when i was only 30 minutes in i did not read fifty shades of grey but based on this film and that it started as a fanfiction of twilight i fucking hate the movie and the plot theres no chemistry and nothing but awkward moments fifty shades of grey has like one good moment when ana was drunk and she parodied the film thats it everything else is nothing but poor acting poor editing and poor chemistry im sure there could have been more better and interesting parts but fifty shades of grey doesnt even give itself a chance
Feb 16 2015,neutral,ending was dumb a fuck
Feb 16 2015,positive,only wish the female lead was a bit more dramatic but i thought it was great overall
Feb 16 2015,negative,worst movie ever  they tried to hard to make it feel like the book and that made it worse  they should have left it as a book
Feb 16 2015,positive,its not nearly as bad as most make it out to be yet its not as good as it should be either mr greys acting isnt very believable you just cant imagine anyone talking and acting as he does throughout the film and many other aspects of the film simply arent realistic also we were expecting this dirty film to be far kinkier no it does not deliver as well as it should but i believe its worth a watch just to see what all the hype is about
Feb 16 2015,neutral,although i thought it was tastefully done and i was pleased with the casting something about 50 shades just left me disappointed the separation point was also a disappointment because it was not very climactic and it left me more annoyed than anticipatory
Feb 16 2015,positive,i thought the movies was great and the ending left you wanting more just like yhe book cant wait for part 2
Feb 16 2015,positive,loved the soundtrack visuals chemistry and conflict within the relationship at times moved a bit slowly dakota johnson took an unappealing literary character and made her completely charming jamie dornan captured the intensity of his character if not the accent overall i found the movie to posses a beautiful sort of melancholy in its portrayal of two people at odds within their mutual attraction
Feb 16 2015,negative,if i wanted to watch soft core pornid stayed at home
Feb 16 2015,positive,going in with low expectations i was very very pleasantly surprised it was erotic without being crude and the chemistry between ana and christian was excellent i was worried about them not being able to pull off the tortured soul of christian grey but the did a great job with it i found myself liking the ana character even more than i did in the books i would have loved to see more of the story the book told but i understand the timing issue its not a must see in the theatre but for fans of the book it is a must see cant wait for fifty shades darker
Feb 16 2015,positive,i personally thought they did a great job on this movie and i enjoyed it the movie was a little awkward at first but as it went along it got better i thought the way they added humour to it made it less cheesy and the last scenes were the best of the whole movie if you enjoyed the book there is no reason you shouldnt enjoy the movie looking forward to the next one
Feb 16 2015,positive,i loved the movies and the books  my husband went with me and thought it was good  i have been in abusivecontrolling relationships and this story is not that
Feb 16 2015,negative,expected more couldnt connect with the terrible dialogs bad acting and boring action generally speaking pretty silly to me maybe for 1516 year old crowd but wait you have to be 18 to watch it right lol for me disappointing so i have to agree with critics
Feb 16 2015,positive,the movie was ok  i thought the acting was superb and the way it was shot was awesome  i had problems with the story  its like there was no built up of their relationshipit just went they met met again and then sex  the story was true to the book but its like they could have told the movie version better  maybe they took out scenes they should have left tin
Feb 16 2015,neutral,pretty tame not as great as all the women hyped it up to be interesting storyline but definitely not aimed at men
Feb 16 2015,positive,follows the book really well
Feb 16 2015,negative,horrible one of if not theee worst movie ive ever seen and i saw tommy wiseaus the room no story no plot boring characters it cant decide if its a comedy horror or screwy romance novel its offensive smut that desperate 50 somethings crave the fact that society made el james a multimillionaire for this truly sickens me to my soul
Feb 16 2015,positive,i personally loved the movie and the actors i do think that if u havent read the book you wont get as much out of it as someone who has read it  i think that they did a good job taking a 20 hour audiobook 400 page book and condensing it into 2 hours movie your always going to depth from a book because a movie cant show you what someone is thinking
Feb 16 2015,positive,im dying of laughter at the arrogance of the professional reviewerits like saying it was a decent movie for what it was is somehow going to deplete credibilitygimme a break    ive read the books the movie followed the book as much as it could without getting raunchykept the story line in place and did so tastefully    all this crap about chemistry  no director creativity is ridiculous youre making a movie from a very popular bookno one worth their salt would get too creativeunless you wanna piss off your target audience as far as chemistry goesit was fine by the endbelievableits not like you had christina aguilera trying to act next to a wwe character    it was put together welland im guessing the money it will continue to make even after the opening weekend will have a bigger effect on the professional reviewers credibility than if they would have just been objective in the first place    good movie even if you didnt read the book go see it im sure youll want to see the next two
Feb 16 2015,negative,what a waste of time and money
Feb 16 2015,negative,this movie was a terrible version of the first book of the trilogy it doesnt come anywhere near the lustful desires of the book if you liked the book stay with it otherwise this boring agonizing portrayal of this book will disappoint you exponentially
Feb 16 2015,positive,the critics are being far too harsh here they did the best that they could with this storyline it was exactly what i expected after all it is based on an erotic romance novel there are a lot of explicit erotic encounters would i recommend it i think that my opinion doesnt really matter people will go see it to satisfy their curiosity anyways we were all hoping for a little more perhaps a happy ending or a fairytale i am little confused as to what exactly is it that the viewer is expecting from this film
Feb 16 2015,negative,horrible couldnt wait for it to end wrong casting for male role
Feb 16 2015,negative,boring and unromantic worst valentines movie release ever
Feb 16 2015,positive,the sex scenes were ok but other than that this movie was ultraly boring without sex this movie is irrelevant
Feb 16 2015,negative,ive read the book and the movies does a decent job of following the story line but what is a wrenching passionate romance story is turned into an extremely mediocre movie by the bad acting and lack of passion between the two leads
Feb 16 2015,negative,this movie was awful its crazy how sex saleslol 82mil made off pure trash only in america right
Feb 16 2015,negative,was a horrible movie  wouldnt recommend to anyone this movie was more for with an hbo hardly any words spoken with just cheap sex moves the movie has zero plot  thanks for wasting date night  with my husband   btw the writer of the book sh  ould be ashamed in you for killing such an easy movie to make
Feb 16 2015,positive,it was very true to the book and while not truly special it was a really wonderful adaptation very well cast with a great soundtrack and great for a fun day at the movies with the girls
Feb 16 2015,negative,lack of chemistry between dakota and jamie movie so boring with no emotion so much publicity for a movie that it doesnt follow the book a lot of love and less sex if you a true fan of the book youll be disappointed they focus in their relationship and leave behind the principal action or theme of the book
Feb 16 2015,negative,funniest movie of the year awesomely bad if you like seeing bad movies and laughing at douchebag main characters then this is your movie
Feb 16 2015,positive,i loved it a lot more than the books  they took the annoying internal dialogue of the book and turned it in to a movie i could enjoy i thought sam taylorjohnson did a wonderful job performances from dornan and johnson were stellar
Feb 16 2015,negative,dont waste your money its a two hour movie and you leave feeling like you didnt see the whole thing considering the content i thought it would be more exciting
Feb 16 2015,negative,fifty shades of grey is not without visual style and a performance from dakota johnson that guarantees shell get more promising hopefully offers however as talented as johnson is it doesnt compensate for her characters paperthin depth the terrible lack of chemistry between her and her onscreen partner jamie dornan or the overall sense of tedium director sam taylorjohnson brings to this dull slowpaced snoozefest for a story thats supposedly an erotic romance this film has the sex appeal of a childrens hospital bombing    full reveal at 
Feb 16 2015,positive,they left some important parts out and changed quite a bit of the dialogue
Feb 16 2015,positive,excellent movie great casting performances equaled the characterizations of the book will see again
Feb 16 2015,negative,what i got to say about fifty shades of gray this is an abomination of hatred and disgust to humanity its dirty from start to finish the performances by the cast is really bad especially the two leads characters the is no chemistry what so ever the directing by sam taylorjohnson is not good at all the screenplay by kelly marcel patrick marber and mark bomback is badly written the cinematography is not that good in some parts of the movie finally the score in this movie works to what is hateful movie is i have to report that  fifty shades of gray is a less than satisfying experience on the screen
Feb 16 2015,positive,omg youre going to need a cold shower
Feb 16 2015,positive,loved every minute of it yes it wasnt as good as the book but what movie is ive seen it twice so far and ill be seeing it again once my friend is done reading the book
Feb 16 2015,negative,awful abusive sickening
Feb 16 2015,negative,just another high budget film that will be leading the box office for weeks but it is just a terrible movie with a nice cast but with one of the worst scripts ive seen in my life  i dont know the book but the story is also poor well theres nothing left  but to wait for the second part that im sure will come soon or later
Feb 16 2015,positive,followed the book well although not my chice of actors the did a decent job
Feb 16 2015,negative,i want to thank this movie to remind me what does sexy really mean  a completely sexywannabe movie
Feb 16 2015,negative,anyone whos messed about with dominancesubmission however recreationally will know there is a realistic moment in the entire film  is it possible that it was actually meant as a parady
Feb 16 2015,negative,please dont go see this if this makes money they will make more of this horrible horrible movie
Feb 16 2015,negative,no chemistry between the leads laughably bad dialogue poor pacing and by the numbers plot cant wait for the honest trailers version of this steaming pile
Feb 16 2015,negative,absolutely horrible  i loved the books and read them 2x  at the end of the movie the whole theater laughed  i dont think that is what was supposed to happen  i usually rate movies  1  would pay full price to see it again 2  wait for video  3  omg no you wont get that 2 hours of your life back  this movie is a big ole 3
Feb 16 2015,negative,perhaps the worst ending in cinematic history
Feb 16 2015,positive,its better than the book and though mrs robinson is completely left out so is anas relentless innermonologuing which i was quite thankful for definitely worth seeing either with your best friend or your man  i opted for the former 
Feb 16 2015,positive,some parts of the book were missing and others were rushed yet the movie was way more than i expected it to be and the characters surpassed the acting i was expecting  cant wait for movie 2  3
Feb 16 2015,positive,this movie was as delightfulintriguingand exciting as the book its definitely not for everyone but those who have read the series will appreciate attention to detail the dept of feelingromance and wittiness the actors displayed on screen to relay with the characters in the books definitely would see again
Feb 16 2015,negative,dont even know what to say i do not really care for this movie
Feb 16 2015,negative,huge waste of your time  save your money
Feb 16 2015,negative,overall pretty lame nothing happens
Feb 16 2015,negative,my grandmother tells a better story than 50
Feb 16 2015,positive,plays much better than the book was written  funny and a bit romantic  loved seeing the torn emotions  cant wait for the squeal
Feb 16 2015,positive,i loved who they casting for ana but the book had so much more to itand not just sex i enjoyed it though
Feb 16 2015,negative,hated it lots of hype poorly done
Feb 16 2015,negative,might be top 10 material in worst movies ive ever seen poor acting written almost as bad as the book idk how a movie about sex could be so boring its was well shot  had a clean look  thats why it gets at least one star but it def does not live up to the hype a new fun pass time is to catch ppl coming out of this movie  seeing their wtf expressions on everyones faces this one is gonna be harder for the fans to defend than twilight
Feb 16 2015,positive,i think they did an excellent job recreating this book i loved every minute of it
Feb 16 2015,positive,i went in thinking it would be horrific but it isnt as bad as reviews portrayed my husband seemed to like it too   granted it wasnt good but wasnt bad watching either worth watching
Feb 16 2015,negative,where was the chemistry
Feb 16 2015,positive,this was a good film the film did have an interesting story and nice views  it would not be too everyones taste but the 2 hour movie went quick
Feb 16 2015,positive,the movie was great  i loved jamie and dakota  it is missing quite a bit of conversations etc from the book but that was to be expected  ready for the next movie
Feb 16 2015,neutral,i didnt hate fifty shades of grey on the contrary i did enjoy parts if not most of it but the part that i did not care for and the biggest reason that i came out of the film with a feeling of indifference is the plot or rather i should say the lack of one i think that what el james in attempting to bring a human face to world of bdsm was inspired she didnt treat it as a joke or like it was something evil and illegal and for that she should be applauded the problem is that the story is from anastasias point of view and she does not feel the way about bdsm as christian does she is looking for something different from him than he is offering the film attempts to make bdsm real and relatable in a way while demonizing it making it the chief point of contention between anastasia and christian    read the full review at 
Feb 16 2015,negative,it was horrible with a capital h
Feb 16 2015,positive,such a good movie the music is amazing i thinks its a really good movie and a good idea how to show people this world a beautiful love story love it
Feb 16 2015,negative,i read all 3 books so the movie was just okay for me  i thought dakota johnson was great  she played the part great she was cute and dorky and sexy as hellnot that jamie dornan was bad but he just wasnt dark enough or dominant and authoritative enough  because ive read the books i will go see the 2nd and 3rd  people who didnt might not
Feb 16 2015,negative,the problem with fifty shades of grey is that not only is it populated by irritating and unrealistic characters it is attempting to pass off physical and mental abuse as love and desire im disgusted by the shallowness and poor quality of this adaptation of the just as horrible bestselling novel for goodness sake this movie makes twilight look good does that say enough
Feb 16 2015,positive,i watched the movie twice it was not that bad like what other people say anna is absolutely bring the humor to the movie and i love it dakota is just the perfect anna jamie overall ok but in the last scene after belt punishment scene you can tell that there he is jamie got the true grey on that scene i just cant wait for the next sequel great job for the cast i hope to see both of them for the next movie 
Feb 16 2015,positive,this movie was exactly what i wanted it to be  being a fan of the books i had hope that they would make the film classy romantic erotic while intertwining christians dominant personality in the sexiest and nonabusive way possible to counteract all the negative articles out there about this story    i will be seeing this movie a second time and it will be making a welcomed appearance in my movie collection    to all fans of this trilogy do not be put off by the negative reviews go see it for yourself  ana and christian do not fail to please and entertain
Feb 16 2015,positive,loved it  jamie was awesome and dakota was absolutely adorable  for people who compare this movie to rape or abuse is very demeaning to the victims of real rape or abuse all behavior in this movie was consentual between 2 adults  to think otherwise is very closeminded and a slap in the face to anyone who has suffered at the hands of a rapist or an abuser
Feb 16 2015,positive,awesome movie   critics read the books 
Feb 16 2015,positive,if you loved the book youll love this movie dakota is adorable as ana and jamie was a great christian you could slightly hear his accent every now and then but it was cute so it didnt bother me
Feb 16 2015,positive,dont let the critics fool you  if you enjoyed the book then you will enjoy the movie  it is what it is and for that it deserves 5 full stars
Feb 16 2015,negative,between the completely unjustified relationship between the two protagonists the sheer lack of a story line the awkward dialogue and the blatant sexism this may be among my least favorite movies ever what was supposed to be a spicy romance had me checking my watch and cringing at least my friends and i had something to laugh about afterward
Feb 16 2015,positive,cant wait for next one
Feb 16 2015,positive,saw over the weekend  surprisingly dakota johnson was spot on  didnt want to like her in the role but i did  jamie dornan was another story altogether  horribly miscast  he had no chemistry with dakota  he was not greekgod gorgeous as the books convey  he was too dainty of a man to be believable  they should have cast a stronger leading man a better looking leading man and a more substantial leading man  while the film was very close to the book it lost something in the translation  i believe that was because dornan did not take command of the big screen  if they do continue with book 2 hopefully they can recast the lead role because i dont think anyone will pay to see him again  three of the front runners for that role would have all done better  matt bomer ian sommerhaulder and charlie hunnam would have been believable as christain grey  come on sam taylorjohnson please right this wrong on the next iteration
Feb 16 2015,positive,i personally really liked this movie it is not what people are making it out to be at all it just shows a side of relationships in the bedroom that is taboo to discuss publicly many times
Feb 16 2015,negative,highly disappointed i didnt feel the connection between anna and christian at all and to be honest i thought it was pretty boring again very disappointed considering all they hype surrounding the books and the movie
Feb 16 2015,positive,so much better than the book if people would stop taking it so seriously and just take the movie for what it is a fun sexy naughty film to see with your girlfriends i think they would enjoy it a lot more i couldnt finish the book trilogy but im very excited for a movie sequel
Feb 16 2015,neutral,50 shades biggest sin is its mediocrity it isnt basic instinct neither is it showgirls it is what happens when a high school performs shakespeare it has the elements and its performed earnestly but it doesnt amount to much and the result is a little incoherent
Feb 16 2015,negative,horrendous movie cliched no storyline terrible acting cringey camera work waste of money oh and did i mention how abusive it is i felt horrendously uncomfortable throughout paying money to see that money feels like i have spent money promoting rape and physical assault waste of time
Feb 16 2015,negative,horrible and boring just as lame as the book
Feb 16 2015,negative,pure fan service that will not win over any new fans when you break it down its really just the most erotic movie about paperwork
Feb 16 2015,positive,i could see how the ones who did not read the books might have negative reviews to give about this move because of the abrupt ending and were it left off however i for one did enjoy the books and thought the movie brought the books to life wonderfully i cant wait for the next movie if you read  enjoyed the books dont let the negative reviews prevent you from seeing it it was really good
Feb 16 2015,positive,its was a great movie cant wait for part 2
Feb 16 2015,negative,so much worse than i feared it would be  no chemistry between the main characters poor casting all around it was like a high school production of the book even the soundtrack was awful and distracting so disappointed
Feb 16 2015,negative,this movie seems a long xrated commercial of déodorantit is a cross gender between pretty woman and twilight much ado about nothing  even the sex scenes look plasticthe main couple is cute thoughentertaining for 15 minutesi guess will have to wait for number ii and iii
Feb 16 2015,positive,geared completely for the ladies just like the book
Feb 16 2015,negative,horrible acting     i wish they wouldve played more into the fact that mr grey was mentally disturbed
Feb 16 2015,negative,imagine if you were to merge hard core porn with twilight horrible absolutely disgusting not a romance  call it what it is abusive porn
Feb 16 2015,negative,i can not honestly give this movie one starthough it seems i must give it half a star to post my thoughts i was so disappointed i heard the rumors that it didnt stack up but i went in with an open mind and came out wishing i hadnt spent my money or my time two thumbs down 
Feb 16 2015,positive,loved it hot and sexy
Feb 16 2015,negative,not sure if i missed something but this movie is horrible
Feb 16 2015,positive,followed the book amazingly loved it
Feb 16 2015,neutral,dakotas performance is not enough to give this clitlit any actual colour
Feb 16 2015,neutral,lack of on screen chemistry totally miscast and just downright boring i loved the books but this didnt even come close
Feb 16 2015,negative,it has its funnygood moments but they are few and far between it reminds me of hbo after midnight with better writing
Feb 16 2015,neutral,terrible casting
Feb 16 2015,negative,worst audi commercial ive ever seen
Feb 16 2015,positive,if you didnt like the book and think your far too itelligent for it then dont waste your time watching the movie i enjoyed this film both leading actors played the parts well although i think the writing could have allowed shown more depth to mt greys character sex sceens not smutty and nicely done this is not a porn movie people it a romance that is on par with many romance movies out there the addition of the bdsm undetone gives it a different edge i will watch it again
Feb 16 2015,positive,this movie had its moments where it made me bight my bottom lip and get a few goosebumps after the initial shock the story does not go anywhere
Feb 16 2015,positive,im a fan of fifty shades of grey book series  watch the movie and im happy the casts were awesome  especially dakota ana and jaime christian they play the characters so well i love the movie cant wait for fifty shades of darker
Feb 16 2015,negative,youre not supposed to laugh at the naughty bits right
Feb 16 2015,positive,i thought it was a tastefully done erotica movie
Feb 16 2015,positive,this movie was amazing at first it was a little cheesy but so was the beginning of the first book i dont know why people are saying it was the worst movie i have definitely seen way worse i thought it followed the book very well if you didnt get into the movie then you obviously didnt get into the book so why go see it even my fiancã c who doubted the idea of the book enjoyed it
Feb 16 2015,positive,in my opinion the movie is a love story the books also because in general the people only focus on the sex scenes and forget that exists a story outside the red room and is the story how anna made christian discover the love  and somehow his inner peace for the ones that already read the book you know that dakota and jamie made a very good representation of the characters
Feb 16 2015,positive,absolutely brilliant   very gripping  jamie has done an excellent job at portraying the character or mr grey  will definitely be going to see again
Feb 16 2015,negative,vacuous poorly acted no screen chemistry no depth just naked tomfoolery if you want to see a good bdsm movie watch secretary instead
Feb 16 2015,positive,followed the book almost perfectly missed out on joses  dios mio quotes and its just as weird to hear dorian say  layers baby as it was to read it but they played out the scenes very well especially the ending the chemistry between the 2 could even help the movie come across as a romcom sometimes loved it cant wait for the next 2
Feb 16 2015,negative,i really wanted to like this film i really did however when i watched the film my only thought were oh my god this is so boring there was no chemisrty between the two lead roles in the first place 90 percent of the storyline was cut out so it made the film just jump everywhere one second they are at the graduation then back at her place then do the nasty then he leaves um i am pretty sure there was a little more happening in the books than that the support roles were non existent you see kate for about 30 seconds in total there were so many moments i was cringing into my seat in the books its was kind of sexy but in the film portrayal i just wanted to walk out and slap myself for wanting to even watch it the portrayal of ana was done well i thought she was a lot better in the film than in the books she actually stuck up for herself more like an actual human being and not a computer but i thought that the christian grey portrayal was shoddily done at best he didnt have the strength that christian grey was supposed to be and i just found myself literaly rolling my eyes when ever he opened his mouth    the sex scenes were done well it gave u the jist of what was going on and left the rest to imagination my only problem again was that it just wasnt how it was supposed to be a lot of the domination was in speech and psychology rather than the act itself but in the film he just tied her up and that was it thats not really dominant thats just kink just saying    overall i think the film could have been so much better the lead roles could have had more chemistry and they stripped so much of the actualy storyline out that if you hadnt read the books you would have been completely lost the scenes didnt flow together at all more like jumped from one place to another without any time seeming to pass at all     so dissappointed the trailer to the film for me was better than the entire film my advice people stick to the book it might not be the most literate out there but at least you know where you stand
Feb 16 2015,positive,very good film  i love it d
Feb 16 2015,negative,so unbelievably cringeworthy it was like drinking neat vinegar and lemon juice mixed together    sam tj did the best she could but the acting was stiff no pun intended and mechanical     about as arousing as a trip to the clap clinic
Feb 16 2015,negative,lacking in acting the books were good the movie could have been as well but the actors left much to be desired wheres the spark wheres the attraction  wheres the caring after the spanking and most importantly where did the other half of the sexstory go  i was truly looking forward to seeing this movie and i left the theater wishing it would have been better
Feb 16 2015,negative,very badly acted and if your going to make a film about dominance and sadism then you may as well go all out the book was brilliant film was such a disappointment though
Feb 16 2015,positive,this movie was cast perfectly jamie dornan  dakota johnson played their parts very well it followed the storyline of the book and did not disappoint and if you have read the novels you can fill in the gaps yourself they obviously couldnt include everything in this movie for those of you giving it a bad rating you clearly had no idea what you were getting into and never read the books this movie isnt really about bdsm its the beginning of a love story and a turning point in the life of a conflicted man who was tortured and traumatized as a child there were 5 women of various ages in our group and all of us enjoyed this movie and are looking forward to the next 2
Feb 16 2015,negative,holy crap thats 2 hours of my life i wont get back
Feb 16 2015,negative,the book was absolute crap why would i want to see the movie
Feb 16 2015,negative,it has very bad review on film
Feb 15 2015,negative,12 star  never was i so grateful for the end credits excepting a fine soundtrack this film evenly disappoints with little character development stiff performers utter dialog lacking subtlety nor intrigue photographically vacant ordinary compositions of wealthy locations lack any focus revealing story even an exotic playroom seems drab i didnt read the books but this movie lacks depth and romance save your well earned dollar for a better investment of two hours
Feb 15 2015,negative,slow slow and slower
Feb 15 2015,negative,this movie was awful to the core i am so upset at how dumb it was there was no plot and the lead female was an awful actress many of the scenes from the book were left out and the entire movie just felt rushed and incomplete awful movie and a waste of money
Feb 15 2015,positive,i read the books and i thought it was a good adaptation  theres been lots of criticism of the actors but i thought they played the role well
Feb 15 2015,positive,movie was amazing  the actors did such a good job i cant wait till part 2  loved it loved it loved it
Feb 15 2015,positive,i thought i the actors played the characters perfectly everyone is going g to say she was tortured and manipulated but she said yes this isnt your typical love story which is awesome i cant wait till the next movies
Feb 15 2015,negative,movie was boring fell asleep mor times than i can remember
Feb 15 2015,positive,felt they didnt keep with the book as good as they could have it had funny parts and enjoyed it
Feb 15 2015,positive,my husband and i really enjoyed it it was comedic and quirky sometimes it was awkward feeling but that wasnt a bad thing i will definitely be buying the dvd and seeing both of the sequels dakota johnson was perfection as ana
Feb 15 2015,negative,i never read the book the movie is not as kinky as people made it seem and all i remember is blah blah blah blah ow
Feb 15 2015,negative,waste of time and money good thing i didnt pay for my ticket
Feb 15 2015,positive,i thought it was great im looking forward to the next movie  the acting was good and it was pretty spot on with the book i recommend it to anyone
Feb 15 2015,negative,while this was an improvement from the book and offered titillating erotic scenes it suffers from the same defects from its source material unrealistic dialogue no real ending a weak plot development and ultimately uninteresting characters it even felt boring at times
Feb 15 2015,negative,the movie was ok if your into that kind of sex in movies
Feb 15 2015,negative,quite honestly this is one of the most boring and drawn out pornos ive ever seen
Feb 15 2015,negative,cheese  so full of cheese and cliche  the whole theater was laughing at the ridiculous one liners that occurred over and over again
Feb 15 2015,positive,this is the most underrated movie in the cinema  it is the first part of 3 parts and unlike hunger games the ending is good where you know there will be more but leaves you in a good spot where what has occurred has came to a close
Feb 15 2015,positive,enjoyed it and wanted to see more cant wait for the next one
Feb 15 2015,positive,true to the book in every detail loved it
Feb 15 2015,negative,worst movie of this generation
Feb 15 2015,positive,not as bad as expected both hubby and i were more intrigued and curious to see whats all the fuss was about this movie than anything we were ready to be utterly disappointed but we werent i enjoyed the conversations but thought the story was very predictable i didnt read the book to certain point cheesy the only thing that made this movie different from all other modern fairytale was the play room which didnt reveal itself at all until the very end
Feb 15 2015,positive,where 5 stars is the matrix trilogy and 4 stars is love actually
Feb 15 2015,negative,i should have walked out of the theater feeling at least a little scandalizedinstead i left utterly bored
Feb 15 2015,positive,omgthat was my reaction to most of itthey said in reviews that there wont be a lot of frontal i beg to differ lol i went with my friends and needless to say we were blushing and giggling through out it i thought it did the books well the ending sucked but got me excited for movie 2 and 3  i thought jamie dorman did a great job as christian although a better casting choice for me would have been the guy who plays thor  am i right anyway the girl dakota johnson did good too much boob shots for me though and a down there shot very shocking  never seen that done so well done there director in short i enjoyed myself seeing this and giggling through most of it i will see it again 
Feb 15 2015,negative,i had low expectations but this is just terrible
Feb 15 2015,positive,dakota johnson did an incredible job however the male character jamie dornan was not played as coldly fierce as the book characterization which i believe is necessary for the evolution of this mans characterization people who go to this without understanding of the novels and its content are generally thinking this is sick or porn that is not at all a fair characterization
Feb 15 2015,positive,i was pleasantly surprised it was a decent script adoptation and i liked the portrayals of the characters by the two leads waaaay more than i expected it had some cute humor like in the books and definitely some graphic sex scenes but focused more on their story     of course the movie ends abruptly just like the first book so if you havent read the books to know how the story continues it will seem like a horrible ending but even if you havent read them you would still enjoy the movie that is if youre not too offended by bsdm themes
Feb 15 2015,negative,all i could think about when is it going to be over  i ended up falling asleep
Feb 15 2015,neutral,if you read the books you know the writing was subpar and simplistic book 1 was big on shock value and sex and small on plot and character development i still dont understand why people thought the movie would be any different while the multiple nipple shots and sex scenes holy bush were gratuitous it was true to the book even seeing it with my husband was more awkward than erotic yes i will see the second film because i found the second book was better and more developed than the first i thought dakota johnson made anastasia seem naive but strong jamie duran worked so hard to conceal his british accent that he never really seemed to get into character he never rose from the category of stalker into maninlove viewers make sure your expectations are realistic for the film you are seeing
Feb 15 2015,negative,now ive deduced that that mysteriously enticing power of that trailer solely comes from beyoncãs remix of crazy in love
Feb 15 2015,positive,just what i imagined
Feb 15 2015,negative,there was just no chemistry
Feb 15 2015,negative,if ratings could go in the negative scale id put it about 2 the movie was terrible all to the end the main character was a jerk and used his riches and charm to seduce and control women  i hated him from the beginning and all the way to the end wasnt worth the ticket price
Feb 15 2015,positive,going into this movie all i could talk about was the fact that it received a 26 on the tomatometer and a 51 from the audience people like me let me tell you try to erase all of the hype from the last two years out of your head and all of the negative feedback from the last week or so and go see this movie for yourself my wife is a fan and she read all three books in two weeks almost two years ago and she could not stop talking about this movie along with 90 of the women aged 2048 in america that was annoying now the movie is here and it is getting ripped apart and rightly so however without giving any spoilers i will say it has exceeded my expectations the hypeexpected to see a great movie  the negative reviewsi regretted purchasing my ticket prior to seeing it and expected another twilight minus the vampires what did i get from this movie a funny movie that was funnier than most hyped comedies in the past two years see bridesmaids think like a man too or any other comedy for that matter it tried its best to stay true to its core not short on bdsm without overdoing it and making it feel like subliminal porn minus all of the nuances of the book that the film left out let my wife tell it it was not that bad of a movie and again it was funny which made it worth seeing with me being 1 out of the 4 guys in a theater full of screaming howling women
Feb 15 2015,positive,movie critics disliked the movie because there wasnt enough sex really so if you are wanting to see a sex movie then youll really be disappointed  this movie is more about psychological state of childhood abused billionaire christian grey versus the loving smart but naive ana steele who will get their way  who will change who will winlove or lust
Feb 15 2015,positive,loved the movie just as much as i loved the book i have to admit that some of the things that i thought were important from the book like the underwear scene were hardly touched but still an amazing story can not wait for the next two movies to come out
Feb 15 2015,positive,while many critics both professional and otherwise are slamming this movie left and right i think the most unbelievable thing about this movie is its audience despite its obviouslyadult premise moviegoers are acting like a bunch of children with their disappointment so lets be clear going to a movie to watch hardcore sex is like watching a porno for the acting dont be stupid for one there are censors and two there are these new things called women if you havent slept with one by now you probably arent familiar with their peculiar sense of intrigue and suspense about the bedroom yeah its weird and yeah it isnt as graphic as we men are used to so accordingly i set my sexual expectations for this movie very low going in and youd be a fool in my humble opinion to do otherwise    that said i was pleasantly surprised by the build up if youll recall the best thing about the matrix was you didnt know it was going to be anything special for a summer action movie there wasnt a lot of explanation or promotion for the film so when it turned out to be different than what we all expected we were amazed the followup movies not being even remotely capable of recreating that sense of the unexpected predictably suffered a terrible death 50 shades was the opposite of revolutions for me in that it had all the negative advertising ahead of it with a surprise treatment that made it interesting and ill draw another parallel criticizing dornan for his portrayal of grey is like criticizing reaves for his portrayal of neo it was actually a good fit regardless of what you think of their actual skill and played well for the story    i was surprised too by the brave ending ive never read the books and my girlfriend hasnt finished the first so i didnt know where they were going with it and they didnt go for a feelgood finish quite the opposite so kudos to them for that    so to wrap this up the negativity surrounding this movie is overdone if you can take this movie for what its supposed to be a journey for a naive person into a world unfamiliar youll enjoy it for where it takes you if you dont take it so seriously youll be able to laugh when they negotiate both anal and vaginal fisting like a couple of professional business partners because youre supposed to
Feb 15 2015,positive,was mad at the ending i  wanted more now i have to read the second book to find out what happens
Feb 15 2015,positive,the book is definitely better i still want to see the sequels even though i dont think they picked the right christian when they picked jamie dornan i loved dakota johnson though
Feb 15 2015,positive,dakota johnson and jamie dornam were true to the characters in the book looking forward to the next installment
Feb 15 2015,positive,loved it very true to the book
Feb 15 2015,negative,alot funnier then i believe was intended
Feb 15 2015,negative,it was an average show that actually got a little redundant with all the time he undressed her  it was a little dark strange and i never felt like it ever realty went anywhere
Feb 15 2015,positive,this was well worth seeing its very close to the book enjoyed the sex scenes

Feb 15 2015,negative,it was certainly a disappointment  definitely not worth the money to see
Feb 15 2015,negative,i havent read the books but some friends wanted to see it and i wanted to give it a shot dakota johnson is believable in her role although much of the dialogue does her no favors jamie dorman looks uncomfortable in the role and awkward which contradicts the character hes supposed to be portraying the script here comes off more juvenile than adult and the film drags because of it  watch unfaithful for steamy forbidden romance
Feb 15 2015,positive,read all the books was not disappointed  a must see
Feb 15 2015,negative,bad acting no substance glorified mental and physical abuse and this is what america craves
Feb 15 2015,positive,having read the book the movie just doesnt touch the emotions nearly enough for me and it ends on a rough note so for those that havent read the series im not sure they are left with the desire to come back for book 2 i like dakota johnson she is cute and strong as anna i cant make up my mind about jamie dornan ill go see the next one though for sure hoping for some improvement though
Feb 15 2015,positive,i thought 50 shades was a tasteful version of what is a very detailed and in depth version i think the actors did a wonderful job portraying there characters those people who expected obscene sex as portraying in the book are foolish the movie was well made and had a lighthearted side as well i look forward to the sequel
Feb 15 2015,positive,i liked it hopefully then next ones will have more sex scenes plus longer sex scenes it like your just starting to get into it  the scene is over i will watch them all but the sex was just a bit of a let down

Feb 15 2015,positive,add to my wish list to see
Feb 15 2015,negative,it didnt tell a story at all there were no internal conflicts solved or even shown and the ending was far from an acceptable people in the theatre were even laughing at the horrible dialogue
Feb 15 2015,negative,this movie has all the makings of a piece of crap wooden acting check cheesy script lifted from equally cheesy novel check much like to books the only redeeming quality in the film is all the sexy fun time neither of the leads possesses an especially pretty face luckily they spent so much time naked that you werent looking at their faces anyhow and ill give them this  they both had great bodies
Feb 15 2015,positive,read all 3 books so was convinced going in this was poorly cast and would bomb  wow pleasantly surprised  the acting was extremely good it was quite tastefully done and my husband and i both really enjoyed it  the music was really good and placed perfectly  good job  it followed the book with class
Feb 15 2015,positive,my wife daughter and i thought its was excellent  we felt it did a great job of following the books  the casting was outstanding and the acting outstanding
Feb 15 2015,negative,i loved the books but not the movie  i thought there was very little chemistry between the christian and ana characters which is not like the books at all  i would not watch it again  hopefully the second one will be better
Feb 15 2015,negative,terrible movie dont waste your money
Feb 15 2015,neutral,i loved the actress in the movie but mr grey didnt quite fit in my eyes  he looked awkward most of time  some parts of the book i wished they would of kept werent there and the ones that were werent as intense as in the book
Feb 15 2015,positive,fifty shades of grey is a beautiful movie jamie and dakota were amazing  cant wait for fifty shades darker

Feb 15 2015,positive,great movie reminds me of me haha
Feb 15 2015,negative,horrible movie loved the books
Feb 15 2015,negative,hollywood have always been obsessed with erotic movies and erotic thrillers not because are appealing to the audience only because it makes money from basic instinct the body of evidence 9 12 weeks wild orchid the lover body heat henry  june sliver fatal attraction eyes wide shut and color of the night these movies contain heated sex scenes and a plot that justify those scenes but also these movies were made thinking of breaking boundaries when it comes to that content    hollywood newest attempt is the movie fifty shades of grey based on the famous novel directed by sam taylorjohnson and starred by jamie dornan christian grey  dakota johnson anastasia steele the film tells the story of anastasia steel a literature college student that is covering for her roommate to interview a famous seattle millionaire christian grey from the very beginning both have a strong connection that leads to numerous sexual encounters the film use metaphoric images that might be a cheap directing or visual trick for the audience after anastasia finish the interview you will see her walking out the grey building while is pouring rain that could also be assume is visual representation some sexual lubrication or intense sweating the other scene represented by anastasia playfully using a pencil with mr grey company logo in a phallic way throughout the movie anastasia and christian will grow a relationship of possession intense sexual intercourse and also odd sadomasochistic encounters     fifty shades of grey is not a good adaptation of the book after carefully reviewed the content of the novel i realized that this is a poor representation of the original not necessary telling that this  book is a noble price material is just a steamy literature of sexually unsatisfied people this adaptation look like fifthy shades of grey for dummies none of the characters have enough strength to just stand up by themselves but only as an accessory like the fancy gifts that mr grey send to anastasia during several scenes of the movie    the acting is really flat specially from someone as talented as jamie dorman who is amazing in the bbc tv show the fall dakota johnson just play the beautiful virgin    fifty shades of grey doesnt have any artistically value there is only one shot that can only be consider beautiful which is a scene were anastasia and christian sit across from each other in a conference room while discussing their famous agreement of sexual domination    at the end this movie just helps to sell more books sadomasochistic  props and perhaps the soundtrack
Feb 15 2015,negative,dornan had an accent at times which was irritating and i thought dornan and johnson had 0 chemistry
Feb 15 2015,positive,it followed the book very well i thought it was very tasteful and exciting definitely a must see cannot wait for the next movie
Feb 15 2015,positive,a tonne of fun  sensual romp hemingway didnt write this  screw the critics  this was a highly entertaining evening didnt read the books so totally entertained
Feb 15 2015,negative,in the waiting room when ana was waiting for mr grey there was a huge panda painting    this movie was a drinking game of repeat dialogue    drink once  when ana complains about christian not sleeping in the same bed     take a drink when you hear the word contract trust me youll be drunk quick on this one    take a drink when christian creepily show up to stalk ana     guys its a one time watch  but wait for the video
Feb 15 2015,negative,it tries its best but ultimately cannot overcome such wooden laughable dialogue even if there is an interesting romancepsychological analysis buried somewhere deep underneath
Feb 15 2015,neutral,i was kinda looking forward to the anal fisting scene before anna callously ruled it out for the physics aspect more than anything  i mean how much effort must go into that a whole fist and wheres the pleasure mr grey would end up with a palm like a jar of nutella and anna would most defiantly have an arsehole like the japanese flag   other than that a pretty average film a goldilocks affair of not too good but not too bad
Feb 15 2015,positive,i loved this movie it kept to the book but added a sense of humor to take out what could be some really awkward scenes
Feb 15 2015,positive,excellent    this movie stayed true to the book dakota did an amazing job portraying anastasia steele i enjoyed her silliness and how she showed her deep emotions there where things that was left out but where only small details of the story i think that the main idea of the movie was brought out both christian and ana had great chemistry the sex scenes were better than what i anticipated   i say watch the movie but you should read the book in order to understand the outcome i will be watching this again cant wait for part 2
Feb 15 2015,positive,i thought the movie stayed true to the book dakota played ana just liked i imagined her jamie not as much but still did fine i enjoyed it
Feb 15 2015,negative,i can talk about auto erotic asphyxiation until you are blue in the face but after seeing the movie you will wish you hadnt you would wish you would over commit the aea and just die after words dont see this even if you are dragged to see it just go to the bathroom and never come back book sucks and thus movie sucks worse     you know there is other movies about sex that you can watch with your significant other it is called porn sorry lines are better too
Feb 15 2015,negative,this was the worst movie and the plot sucked theres no originality for this movie seriously a 9 half weeks want to be surely someones erotic fantasy written and an epic fail on movie screen
Feb 15 2015,negative,lametotal waste of time and money read the books if you want to know the story
Feb 15 2015,positive,this is the best movie i have ever seen and i would 100 recommend it
Feb 15 2015,negative,this movie raped my intelligence the american pie movies are sexier than 50 shades of grey this movie did not turn me on like the book if your girlfriend wants to watch just take her to a soulja boy concert instead the book is more descriptive and sexier than this lame movie
Feb 15 2015,positive,pretty much a porno with a storyline
Feb 15 2015,positive,i liked it not all of it and some scenes couldve been made more intimate like the book but overall i liked it
Feb 15 2015,positive,i actually went into this thinking it would be rubbish after all the poor ratings on all sites but it was ok the soundtrack was good i liked the male lead he played the troubled guy really well but the relationship was ruined by the girl at the beginning about half way through her acting got better and the conflicting emotions were really well shown yes it was not really bdsm and pretty tame but they want people who read the book to be able to sit through it and as a couple i think it would of been really awkward to the mainstream of they went overboard on those sex scenes but the tone and ideas were there so it was ok     my main issue was anastasia was not that attractive and she is supposed to be be amazing and i was not aroused by any of the naked scenes it just didnt feel natural and sexy with her    i will watch the others as story wise which is the whole point of a book or film it was actually rather interesting and thought provoking but one thing is they can have both the sex and the relationship so it makes the normal person go i dont see the problem just do the bdsm and have the relationship why one and not the other and oh my god the flatmate looks like it could be her mum looks in her 30s for gods sake
Feb 15 2015,positive,i viewed with five friends and we all enjoyed it of course they could not match the intensity of the book without being 5 hours long and rated xxx but it was entertaining and cast well we cant wait for the sequel
Feb 15 2015,positive,spoiler alert a review of this film only really makes sense with reference to the denouement   my guess is that part of the problem that some people have found with fifty shades as a film lies in audience expectation so ill skip references to the book and focus on the bigscreen version   there is a definite feel particularly in the early stages of the direction of fifty shades leaning towards fashioning a pretty woman for a highly sexed demographic poor girl falls for rich boy feels out of place but gradually adapts to his affluent and manly ways while teaching him the power of love in return this pattern is virtually a genre in itself and i could well imagine richard gere as christian grey the initial surface niceness of the characters in fifty shades though removes much of even the mild social tension underlying the premise of pretty woman and makes for an opening with even fewer dimensions as the first moves of the film drifted in this direction i found myself settling down for an evening of predictability romcom with the puns replaced by ropes  however although social status in fifty shades provides the opportunity for a couple of standard set pieces on the lifestyle of wealth cars helicopters the like the film is more about sexual mores which is where the audience expectation comes into play in this dimension in trying to forge its own identity the cinematography dallies with the slowpanning style of soft porn while sharing a certain pouty artistic attitude with pedro almodóvar but it never really finds the cojones to go full frontal physically or psychologically   there are amid this worthy moments like the business negotiation of a contract defining sexual limits that let the audience titter knowingly at terms and taboos and this is where the films dramatic tension is built in a fairly traditional will shewont she format flavoured with the taboo topics of bondagedominancesadism    plenty of material for discussion is to be found here the attitude on one side of the fence might be that deviation from sexual norms may be bad as in unpleasant while the attitude on the other side of the fence with the swingers and hedonists may be that more conservative traditions are bad as in dull or repressed  fifty shades focuses largely on two individuals exploring some aspects of this discussion and evolves fairly naturally into a question of how far is too far  and so to the denouement  the rounds of imagery of submission have by this point added several layers of symbolism to the couples intimacy and the sacrifice that one individual makes to bring the other catharsis becomes visually and emotionally strong  it is an act of selfsacrifice that through the imagery of submission and defeat achieves a victory of selfdetermination  this doesnt result in an archetypal hollywood happy ending  however for me it is stronger as a consequence and as such it is almost a pity that a sequel is all but inevitable
Feb 15 2015,negative,well the fact that i only made it through the first 70 pages of the book should have been my first clue  i saw it only because i thought i must have been missing something because of the books huge popularity  i was correct when i put the book down  if you think you are missing something and have to see it youre wrong
Feb 15 2015,positive,the film jumps around a lot missing important details and it is relatively annoying however if you have read the book your imagination still fills in the gaps this is not a bad movie it just misses some of the parts that are more intriguing than others portrayed in the book from the film in honesty if the film was exactly like the book then it would be rated nc17 which some theaters do not accept as it is classified as porn in a way i enjoyed the movie for what it gave me and i see it again
Feb 15 2015,negative,i found it to not be a good movie at all just as poorly written paced and explained infact its worse as any one who hasnt read the books doesnt get what a lot of audience are laughin about and the actngs so trite you cant work out if shes turned on or needs to fart its a bit like those soft core porn movies they used to put on channel 5 to get viewership up when they first started that channel but with worse acting
Feb 15 2015,negative,after all the hype the worldwide phenomenon that women around the world have been gushing over finally hits the big screen fifty shades of grey has been known for its graphic depiction of bdsm and steamy sex scenes that have women glued to the pages going in i thought i was going to see some intense stuff after leaving the theater i wondered thats it first off when seeing a movie based on a book based on a twilight fan fiction you know you are not going to get casablanca or an affair to remember there really isnt much story it is just about a girl who meets a guy who likes to have sex and do it with his toys the fact that there is a trilogy is mindboggling but i have seen worse this leaves the two leads to make the movie interesting jamie dornan and dakota johnson do a good job in their roles it is not their fault the dialogue is often laughable and dry though jamie dornan is every bit of a leading man i hated christian grey to me he came off as a creepy dude who had control issues and not once was i rooting for him on the other hand dakota johnson is likable as anastasia steele the script doesnt give her a lot to work with but she is able to make the performance passable when other actresses might have given a kristen stewartlike performance in fact johnson is the best part of the movie when it came to the sex scenes though they were graphic and sensual something was missing just like the grey character the entire movie had no genuine emotion i have seen more emotion from a sappy pg13 nicholas sparks adaptation from start to finish it was just blah however the cinematography and soundtrack were actually good there was no raunchiness about anything despite the main characters choice of sex life this is one of the cases where the movie could have benefited had it gotten an nc17 rating and actually got into the more detailed stuff from the book why not the rating is not as taboo as people make it out to be and i think fans would have appreciated more fans will probably still love the more toned down rrated version but nonfans and brave boyfriends and husbands will wonder how this story even got published in the first place     grade c
Feb 15 2015,negative,i saw the movie i was very diappointted in dakota johnson as ana steele she over acted the part she was to skinny no figure way to many pieces were cut out and it seemed to be pieced together to sloppy the books were way better not even sure i want to see the second installment of 50 shades of gray it was a real shame
Feb 15 2015,positive,the movie was no comparison to the book overall a good movie worth seeing
Feb 15 2015,negative,i lost 2 hours of my life watching this movie
Feb 15 2015,positive,wonderful movie not abusive at all ana has more pull in the relationship then christian does loved it
Feb 15 2015,negative,stupid stupid stupid  wasted my mans money but mure important my time  
Feb 15 2015,negative,lets take out the storyline and rearrange the whole movie  seriously who loves hours away prior to graduation very disappointed
Feb 15 2015,positive,yes this movie was rather silly but to be frank people have been making way to big a deal out of it as being bad for society  people have diffrent kinds of relationships and this movie does a good job being artistic instead of graphic  i am a man and i got to enjoy this movie because i could laugh at a lot of it because i came in with the mindset of not taking it to seriously  calm down people
Feb 15 2015,negative,read the book but the movie felt like torture jamie dornan is horrible and no chemistry
Feb 15 2015,negative,hollywood should have never attempted to make this movie and who ever thought they could was a fool the only reason this movie will make money is due to women
Feb 15 2015,negative,if you were to have a shot of vodka every time anastasia bites her lipthen youd be tipsy enough to make this film enjoyablebut i didnt have any vodka this film is incredibly dulli dont think ive seen a film that was so bad that afterwards i actually felt angry that i had wasted my life with it
Feb 15 2015,positive,loved it laters baby
Feb 15 2015,positive,i feel like the only one in the world who actually enjoyed this and im not an idiot i am a cinephile and quite critical i dont know how to explain why i enjoyed this so much  so many havent other than that too much connected to me personally i brought so much to the table  so i gave the film a massive benefit of the doubt i overlooked the lead males wooden performance i was shocked to find dakota johnson absolutely not horriblein fact she was a delight charming funny wittyi cheered for her throughout the sex scenes were hot my feminist radar wasnt set off i dont understand all the domestic violence wordage i mean i get it but what a black and white interpretation it tells me that the majority of the public have different views on consent and what bdsm is compared to myself am i really so strange from the norm i see myself as very sensitive i am perplexed i give props to the director  to the leads an enjoyable cinematic experience for me
Feb 15 2015,positive,intriguing story not all what i expected at all
Feb 15 2015,positive,actually surprisingly really liked it
Feb 15 2015,negative,cast tried very hard to bring el james novice bdsm erotica novel to film but it fell flat in awkward pauses and unintentional funny dialog as if no one took this film to be serious beautifully filmed as visuals were large and make it an easy transition page to film like gillian flynns gone girl however detail and casting really made this film fall dakotas acting was weak and dull and ultimately became uninterested in what happened to her or her story
Feb 15 2015,positive,loved it it was a bit condensed but it really work
Feb 15 2015,negative,only because i cant give it a zero
Feb 15 2015,negative,i felt violated after seeing this pap i wished that the glider they rode in would have crashed
Feb 15 2015,positive,very true to the style and emotion of the book
Feb 15 2015,negative,hmm  with a rating of 26 its still gotta be better than the book
Feb 15 2015,positive,it was much better than the critics said it would be i enjoyed the books and i enjoyed the movie yes it is corney the dialogue is silly and the plot has huge holes but i knew that going in because i read the book
Feb 15 2015,positive,so glad i ignored the idiots slamming the movie i am a fan of the books and i think they did a good job of getting the story on the big screen  and really what the heck did everyone expect chick lit  chick flick this was never going to be a movie that changed your life lighten up people
Feb 15 2015,negative,just ok for me books were hard to get through finished first two but just couldnt do it with the third gave the movie a shot just kept thinking how much better it would have been if charlie hunnam was christian greyomg
Feb 15 2015,positive,pretty intense pretty awesome pretty sexy
Feb 15 2015,positive,i saw fifty shades of grey at my local theatre a few hours ago and i thoroughly enjoyed it it was very similar to the books and that pleased me very much the main characters anastasia and christian were cast exceptionally well given the fact that those two parts must be extremely hard to play if you havnt read the books its probally a complete bogus movie to you and youre most likely not going to enjoy it the film is two hours long and theres no time for real character developement like in the books the novel allows you to fall in love with ana and christian and have a better undertsanding of what their story is really about the benefit of having read the books is that i already fell like i know ana and christian and am getting to see the jist of their love story played out right before my eyes that is the magic of this movie i am so pleased with the film and cannot wait until the 2nd comes out when
Feb 15 2015,positive,thought it was refreshing  a sexy and romantic story filmed from a females perspective  a harlequin romance on steroids
Feb 15 2015,positive,loved it very sexy
Feb 15 2015,positive,its funny its fantasy its engaging and sexy easily surpasses the book and my expectations for the movie certain scenes are gorgeouslike when theyre flying in the plane or discussing the contractand dakota johnson acts her ass off  plus it reps seattle the whole time
Feb 15 2015,negative,just felt like i watched a bad porno
Feb 15 2015,positive,actually a decent movie with good actors ana is a lot easier to take when you cant hear her vapid thoughts
Feb 15 2015,positive,more focus on the relationship   the ending was a surprise as i didnt realize it was the first of 3 movies
Feb 15 2015,positive,it was a good movie funny sexy charming upsetting controversial but still a good movie
Feb 15 2015,positive,i didnt read the book but my wife did she said the movie was true to the book with christian being somewhat less abrasive we both enjoyed it dakota was very good in the role we were not expecting an oscar winner but were pleasant surprised those that leave negative reviews what the heck were you expecting
Feb 15 2015,positive,i was expecting worse the chemistry and acting is actually pretty good though the abrupt ending was a bit displeasing though not altogether unsuspected since it s a trilogy
Feb 15 2015,negative,yuck really sucked everyone said the book was good but the whole premise is stupid
Feb 15 2015,positive,duhi didnt go see it for the articles
Feb 15 2015,negative,what the hell was this movie there was no point to the story at all the acting was wooden and they somehow managed to make sex boring this movie is the definition of garbage
Feb 15 2015,negative,boring didnt read the books dont plan to but the story had to be better than that
Feb 15 2015,positive,im a romance author who liked 50 shades but also recognized it had lots of problems but i give it credit for getting everyone talking about womens sexuality and thats a good thing i discuss this at length in my romance beat article that book and now that movie and what to do about it link below i approached sexperts sex educators and an erotic romance authors for their viewpoint as well the gist of the article is since i thought the book helped get us talking we should continue that by standing up and being counted so i promised to see the movie although i had low expectations given the movie trailers i went to opening night and was counted as a fannot a screaming cheering fan like the hordes that filled the theater but i was there munching popcorn and hopeful    and that hope was fulfilled and then some the movie was good even great at times a little slow at the beginning but i think thats because all the movies now move at such a hyper pace its unusual to watch a movie that takes its time then when it does ramp up wow the director came through and made an enjoyable movie without the issues so problematic in the book    even in the pivotal beating scene i could feel christians motivation understand he was exercising his demons in the only way he knows how and see his conflicting love for ana even as he hits her doesnt make it right that he does this needs thisand ana as we know from the book doesnt put up with it but it made sense to me more than it did in the book    i had a second hope for the movie that it would help move the discussion of womens sexuality forwardi realized as i sat and watched that it wont do this the movie is good entertainment the sex scenes artfully done but the books ability to shock to raise awareness about alternative lifestyles to get people talking has already done its jobwhether that was e l james intention or notand the movie doesnt really add to that not when its so entertaining and fun i think that was my mistake layering too many hopes onto one film    so was it the best movie ever made no but it is a very good romance not for everyone not for men that want a car chase or knife fight in every scene but for anyone who wants a romance that is different unusual breaks the moldthis is for you and for anyone that wants to try a new toywatch for the bunny flogger hanging in the red room of pain trust me its sensualicious    
Feb 15 2015,negative,fifty shades of fed up  a quote by christian grey and a review by mando and watkins  from a book that sold millions of copies to sex mad individuals hungry for that one piece of bondage to send them sky high without the actual need to watch a porno then it becomes almost common sense for a film of the book to be made considering how to books sold over 100 million copies in 52 different languages then it become very understandable why a film with so much money potential would be made and wait is finally over fifty shades has exploded onto the scene with a whip smack and a rope burn on to our wallets already making a huge 80 million on its opening weekend and i can say for fans of the book you will be pleased however if youre like me and havent read the books and are judging this purely as just a film then it just doesnt pay off in fact its a complete disaster  the film follows anastasia steele played by dakota johnson visiting the wealthy businessman christian grey played by jamie dornan as favour to her roommate in order to interview him what follows is a mixture odd stalking helicopter rides and epic sex rooms which involves a push and pull relationship between the two with steele falling in love and wanting a normal relationship while grey simply wants a just sexual one only with lots and lots of rope and more whips than a horse race johnson one of the stars of the film makes an admirable leads with her playing the role of nervous girl trying to find love well and well dornan does try his best to create a dark and mysterious character it falls flat with the character appearing as more of creepy stalker than a romantic lover with him doing some odd things such as just appearing a steeles place of work while starring at her and how he states how she is his im pretty sure what youre doing is a criminal offence mr grey and you should be in jail if people in prison like having anal sex as much ana steele does who should be pretty happy  its not all dornans fault however as the whole plot and script to the movie is goddamn awful the director sam taylorjohnson who is behind the very good and underappreciated nowhere boy also trys her best with some sleek and stylish direction that makes an admirable effort and helps keep my attention with some good landscape shots along with a descent soundtrack to back it up she ever directs well the most important scenes to hardcore fans the sex scenes her scenes will impress for both men and women with plenty of scenes of dakota johnsons boobs and butt and jamie dornans abs and cock i think its fair to say that many children will be conceived after their future parents go to see this movie together but in fairness the film decides to not focus on that as much and instead trys to focus on the story its just a shame there isnt one the story is poor and nothing at all interesting actually happens in the film an overview of the entire film is basically  grey hey ana wanna fuck with ropes  ana yes mr grey i would love to  grey great i will get the whips  ana actually this isnt for me  grey oh thats a shame  fin  and that is the whole fucking movie the dialogue doesnt help either and instead left laughing at some of the poor pieces of dialogue mainly from dornans character with such quotes as you dont understand me im fifty shades of fucked up and when he calls taking steeles virginity as rectifying the situation had me in tears of laughter so much laughter i was worried that the countless on 50 women in the cinema would attack me in their cougar rage for daring to mock their precious christian  this makes me question why the hell the film would try to follow the book so much as its pretty clear they have been following the book to death however when the main appeal of the book is the sex and i have even spoke to readers of the book who all agree that the book is manly sex and very little plot so why the hell didnt they add more to the plot when the plot from the book was so thin and that was their main focus the book has a silly plot which should be embarrassed by it silliness and almost make a parody of itself and not take itself too seriously but instead trys to show how serious it should be seen as and that just makes the film all that worse as a result of that  verdict  fsog is a book that diehard fans of the book will love but on whole a film for normal film goers its just another example of a poor romcom despite the performances of johnson and dornan and the direction of taylorjohnson trying to hold it up it fails over its poor story laughable script and lack of truly embracing its silliness makes this more of a fifty shades of fucked up kind of movie as quoted by grey himself  25 stars
Feb 15 2015,positive,people should really read the books before judging the movie you would clearly understand whats going on you wouldnt call the movie abusive or violent because it isnt hope 50 shades of darker gets created and shows on theaters also dakota and jamie stay as the main characters because i love them
Feb 15 2015,positive,this was surprisingly good i thought it was pretty close to the book
Feb 15 2015,positive,very sexy scenes but the ending was too much of a cliffhanger the people in my theater actually threw popcorn and were cursing about how bad the ending aas
Feb 15 2015,neutral,to quote mark kermode not as bad as it could have been not as good as it should have been for me it was a mix between pretty woman and 9 12 weeks
Feb 15 2015,negative,a movie about how to not treat a woman
Feb 15 2015,positive,i really enjoyed the movie i thought that it was a lovely change from the usual blow em up guns at the ready old man heros with teen age heroines i thought that it was a wonderful adaptation and stayed within the spirit of the book series i just wish people would stop putting their own issues into the movie and forcing a domestic violence spin on it it is consensual if it were abuse there not be consent so stop trying to judge what goes on within someone elses relationship just because you dont like it i really liked how dakota seemed to get ana and jamie seemed to understand christians deep need to control good job and enjoyable movie
Feb 15 2015,negative,simply put should of stayed fan fiction the first half i spent with my head in my hands as the acting was just awkward the script must have been written in a afternoon as it was ridiculously tacky in places dont rush down and see it
Feb 15 2015,positive,it was exactly what i was prepared to see   i knew all along they would not show much of the bdsm relationship but more of the personal connection between christian and ana this story is more of a tragedy in regards to the things christian endured as a child and therefore made him the man  or monster  he is today finally the right woman gets him to let go of his past and what he believes he should be in order to look to the present and be the man he can be   wake up folks   its a piece of fiction  you all are treating it like its life and death  there are a lot of movies out there that suck and a lot that are great   we still go see them all dont we  thats entertainment
Feb 15 2015,negative,movie was boring script terrible dialog was awful waste of money this movie was horribly overhyped
Feb 15 2015,positive,tastefully done and the at the end of the film i wanted more i never read the books and was not part of the 50 shades of grey fandom but i enjoyed the movie and will see the next installment
Feb 15 2015,negative,visually wellproduced but frustratingly illconceived and written no character growth or foundation no explanation as to why anastasia did not run away as fast as she could very disappointing
Feb 15 2015,negative,after reading the books i had high hopes for this film but what a let down it was rushed and no build up into how the two become close at the beginning was nothing how i imagined it to be total disappointment
Feb 15 2015,positive,this movie is great  it is exactly like the first book the people giving bad reviews have obviously never read the book
Feb 15 2015,positive,i really do want to see this
Feb 15 2015,positive,excellent portrayal of the book
Feb 15 2015,positive,it was good i just wish they wouldve stayed a little truer to the bookespecially the very end  the job interviews that were left out
Feb 15 2015,negative,sitting through the whole movie became torturous woman who sells herself out falls in love with a guy who has issues anticlimactic and frequently awkward
Feb 15 2015,positive,has to be a man doing the review
Feb 15 2015,positive,they did a good jobi think people are too ashamed to admitt they themselves like kinky sex and to be fucked hard
Feb 15 2015,negative,somewhat sad actually
Feb 15 2015,negative,oh my god dont bother with this movie the dialogue was meant for a 16yearold girl probably written by one too the acting is so cheesy its all oneliners it was like watching a pg movie with tits
Feb 15 2015,negative,laugh out loud bad my friend and i looked at each other as the elevator doors close at the end and say at once dont tell me thats it  and it was  and we broke out laughing  it was so bad we couldnt stop watching sort of like a train wreck acting that rivals cinemax late night  less chemistry than 9th grade   science class  more passion in my first game of spin the bottle  go ahead use any of those for the ads  which they will surely need to take out if they intend to keep this film in the theaters beyond the cold snap in the north  ugh  wow  still cant believe how bad tis was  glad   i saw it otherwise i could not have believed it
Feb 15 2015,positive,in fifty shades of grey  the intense adaptation of el jamesâs fanfiction novel based on the twilight series director samtaylor johnson  screenwriter kelly marcel explore the complex relationship between anastasia steele a rather naãve literature student  secretive billionaire christian grey james dorman dakota johnson plays anastasia steele who on behalf of her roommate seeks an interview with grey intensely attracted to grey despite his warning i dont do romance ana tries to get closer to him which leads to grey confessing that he wants her as well but only on his shocking terms sam taylorjohnson  kelly marcel are able to captured a compelling provocative  surprisingly moving story of two lost souls a quiet  lonely young woman waiting for right person  a young man unable to have an intimate relationship with someone because of the events in his early life the performances from dakota johnson  james dorman were decent during the progression of the film the sexual tensions build between ana  christian leading up to greyâs âplayroomâ which i wonât lie was uncomfortable to watch the similarity to the  twilight series is apparent as you might expect from a rewritten version of  master of the universe  the original online  twilight inspired fan fiction work by james the film is an obvious mustsee for fans of the novel  if you are at all curious i say take a look
Feb 15 2015,negative,lip quivering dribble for sex starved fools if you loved the book you most likely like this same vanilla uninventive trash
Feb 15 2015,negative,the scriptwriters for this movie did a terrible job  it was soon boring dialogue did not exist and you didnt get a grasp of the characters  first the movie wasnt long enough to show what the characters were about and secondwhy didnt they just make this xrated so the sex scenes wouldnt have been watered down so much  bottom line the scriptwriters did a disservice to el james book and to the audience  oh well
Feb 15 2015,positive,dakota johnson made this movie as watchable as it was i was expecting to hate this movie did not hate it did not like it that much either
Feb 15 2015,negative,theatre was packed and silent throughout  movie was horrid  acting was stiff dialogue was flat and chemistry was one sided between leadsfemale was convincing in a difficult role
Feb 15 2015,negative,very disappointed  the actor they chose to play christian was a poor choice
Feb 15 2015,negative,this had the potential to be bold subversive  edgy instead it is flat dull and lacks any chemistry between the two leads
Feb 15 2015,positive,exactly what i thought it would be  it is a supplemental to the book  so it doesnt really stand on its own as a film but it hits all of the high notes of the book just right  i would be interested in seeing some changes and the next book in the collection on the big screen  we shall see
Feb 15 2015,negative,so bad and really uncomfortable definite abuse not recommending to anyone
Feb 15 2015,negative,wont win any oscars but better than i thought it would be  the sex scenes are pretty tame seen more realistic in other movies
Feb 15 2015,negative,what the hell was that
Feb 15 2015,negative,one of the most stupid movies in human history total waste of money unless you are looking for good laughs i just dont get it
Feb 15 2015,negative,i was supposed to see a movie about rape and submission as the book suggest lol but instead this was disguised as a romantic eroticsadist and also stupid obsession    so one of the senseless movies ive ever seen  not a movie and not porn this film is nothing just a piece of scenes and dialogues with really no sense or plot
Feb 15 2015,negative,wow what an insult to humanity women who like it or the books are prettyanti women
Feb 15 2015,positive,best movie adaptation that could of come considering the content of the books
Feb 15 2015,negative,february 13 2015    because el james fifty shades of grey trilogy has sold over 100 million copies worldwide it stands to reason the movie version would at least be interesting then again we might have thought the same thing about twilight and well i guess some books only make for appealing cinema when youre a loyal reader of the source and therefore might be more willing to forgive the movie some of its flaws for the rest of us though sitting through it can be a trying experience     after seeing fifty shades of grey i can understand what the buzz surrounding it could have been about which is not to say i felt any buzz while watching it my hope was that it would be an aggressive assault on the senses and go beyond risqué but its surprisingly dull and inconsequential for such a wouldbe sensual drama     perhaps the problem was my expectations were too high or just plain wrong after all i have not read the novel and after seeing the movie i have no intention to but my views were no doubt shaped by its popularity not to mention the controversial nature of the material and the checkoutline gossip regarding the movies casting and the hype about who was going to play the dominant mr grey and the submissive anastasia steele all this prepared me what would hopefully function as entertaining trash    but entertaining it is not as the movie is simply not well made the filmmakers seem all too aware of the books societal influence and probably assumed either consciously or subconsciously they wouldnt have do much in order to sell itthat a mere shotbyshot straightforward adaptation of james pages would be enough to satiate audiences this explains why i got no sense of adventure from director sam taylorjohnson who doesnt lend the movie any notable style or energy she also seems uncertain of what type of movie she was making either solemn romance or illicit fantasy the constant teetering between the two and our subsequent confusion on how to take it contributes to the movie being a bore    so whats it actually about odds are youre already aware of the premise which is essentially a classic fairy tale albeit with a naughty twist not unlike snow white cinderella or anastasia it follows a smart skinny and prudish girl named whaddya know anastasia dakota johnson a 21yearold college student who meets a 27yearold billionaire ie prince charming named christian grey jamie dornan who heads his own telecommunications enterprise in seattle they meet when anastasia fills in for her roommate eloise mumford and interviews mr grey for their school paper because hes this years commencement speaker     at first anastasia asks mr grey all the usual questions like to what do you attribute your success then out of nowhere she asks him if hes gay granted this what her roommate had written down but anastasia wants to know herself because its obvious this guy has immediately smitten her with his designer clothes perfect body and killer good looks of course were supposed to assume anastasia is still sexually pure what with her conservative attire humble disposition and the fact that she wears her hair up the movie does everything except provide her nerd glasses all this is done so we can eventually see her transform from ugly duckling to beautiful princess    his answer to being a homosexual is no but that doesnt mean mr grey isnt keeping some facts about himself in the closet and herein lies the naughty twist spoiler alert mr grey is a sadist he doesnt do the traditional dating thing or even sleep in the same bed with the women he sees instead he presents them with a legally binding contract that stipulates hes the dominant and shes the submissive his relationships do not revolve around things like intimate conversations dinners movies and holding hands but on punishing women     for the women he assures them its strictly voluntary and says they can walk away at any time but he also promises theyll enjoy their shared exploits if the woman signs the contract he shows her his play room where he keeps things like rope cables whips and blindfolds mr grey isnt they type of man who skimps on quality including accessories for sadomasochism however anastasia isnt like all the other women hes been withher innocence and selfrespect complicate things which of course only draws these two individuals closer together but will their opposing backgrounds and unorthodox relationship allow their their love to be realized    thats the ageold fairy tale question but the problem with fifty shades of grey is it plods along at such a slow and meandering pace we start to not care about the answer too early on even during anastasia and christians first encounter my mind was wandering because the actors embodying these wouldbe complex characters exhibited almost no enthusiasm for their juicy roles and generated little to no chemistry i never even got the sense johnson and dornan were real actors but more like two regular people reciting lines at every stage of their relationship they come across as unbearably stiff and not very credible they lack essentially personalities despite what they do in the bedroom    funnily enough kelly marcels screenplay doesnt approach the material with any sense of irony or selfawareness like we might expect so when the characters speak their often ludicrous and soap opera dialogue the movie doesnt intend for us to laugh at it this would have been fine the movie doesnt have to be hip to itself had the characters actually possessed any weight and dimension but theyre so lifeless that what they say just doesnt resonate theyre passive not only to each other but also to what theyre doing and that translates to us    one of the films only bright spots is marcia gay harden as christians adopted mother her character was the only one i wanted to spend time with and not because shes necessarily interesting but because shes the only one that seemed real and human by comparison anastasia and christian are dull and robotic and by the time christian finally explains his motivations for his private life were so far removed from the story that we dont really care to know its not what he does or says thats offputting its that we simply dont care    fifty shades of grey may have people talking before they see it but i highly doubt it will spark many conversations afterward not when theres so little to it provocative material can only go so far unless something interesting is actually done with it and the makers of fifty of shades of grey dont do a whole lot with what they have i expected and hoped this movie would be a lot of things sexy romantic fun funny or even sleazy but boring  that came as an unpleasant surprise
Feb 15 2015,negative,if you are naive lack any major life experience have never had sex and believe in fairy tales you are going to love this tripe at best its a piss take at worst its a insult to the cinematic paying public who at least want to relate to the characters and enjoy joined up plot do not waste your money
Feb 15 2015,negative,kind of a boring movie
Feb 15 2015,negative,absolute disgrace to the books terrible acting the whole movie was awkward and uncomfortable we got up and left before it was over
Feb 15 2015,negative,25 out of 10 not even sexy
Feb 15 2015,negative,i thought this movie will be as great as the book but turned out not what i expected to be it was charming and sweet for mrgrey the movie was very poorly done it just jumps right into it too quickly
Feb 15 2015,negative,the whole time watching this i kept thinking the love contract cause youd hate to catch a beef for something you know you didnt do
Feb 15 2015,negative,wifes pick wasnt  my kind of movie very graphic  everyone in it was straight crazy
Feb 15 2015,positive,i was pleasantly surprised that i liked this movie even though the reviews were terrible
Feb 15 2015,negative,makes the book look nobelprize worthy
Feb 15 2015,positive,ive  heard so much negativity regarding this movie before i came to see it i will  say this im glade i didnt  listen to the reviews it stayed on course when it came to some very important  parts of the book the intimate scenes were intense without giving anything away it definitely  left you wanting morejust like christian did to ana i hope they continue  the movie sequence fifty shades of grey has a continued fan
Feb 15 2015,positive,a must seei loved this movie cant wait til the sequal comes out if u havent read the books you need to to understand christian grey
Feb 15 2015,positive,looking forward to the next installment
Feb 15 2015,positive,better than i expe considering how bad the critics reviews came in but i dont tend to agree with them much it doesnt follo the book but in all we enjoyed the movie and will go see the sequel
Feb 15 2015,negative,im trying to be fair but i really do think this is one of the worst movies ive seen  there is absolutely no plot  im told the  books have something of a plot but they didnt finish even that minimal story  it is just a soft porn flick the guy is particularly bad  he looks like a high school teeny bopper he is completely unable to pull off the tough rich guy role   business guy role
Feb 15 2015,negative,one of the worst films ive seen
Feb 15 2015,positive,its not amazing but i didnt despise it the problems start at the casting now i havent read the book just excerpts for comedic reading but i think grey is supposed to be a more mysterious character and i dont think jamie dorman did that well he is very monotone and doesnt have much emotional depth to him dakota johnson has little hints of good performances but it isnt consistent marcia gay harden is a breath of fresh air when she arrives i just felt like this movie didnt take enough chances and the r rating is to blame for that i understand that the book is not well written but if you are going to be serious about making a movie it needed more fine tuning and tweaking even the corny lines would be ok if better actors were out front saying them i have always been campaigning for someone like matt bomer who can play mysterious and also deliver comedic lines at least ten times better than jamie a movie like this just should not be so boring i did love the soundtrack but you dont need to play it under every sex scene like we get it you dont have to play a song to make us understand what is happening overall i wasnt itching for the door but i was thinking about who could have done a better job in this movie throughout the whole movie
Feb 15 2015,positive,loved it not like the book but the spirit is there a
Feb 15 2015,negative,they made sure they got women involved in this of course you want the household slaves to make the point that degradation is what all the slaves enjoylike all porn soft or otherwise this movie is meant as a gateway drug for people who dont have the sensitivity and courage to live up to the ideals of our western tradition of romance  i am sure this movie will be a great hit in most of the world where tenderness and respect and concern for womens feelings both sensual and emotional are never remotely considered in the mere biological imperative to inject semen into a convenient disposal place what a terrible export in a time when we need to celebrate our tradition of valuing women in the bedroom and outside of it
Feb 15 2015,positive,i thought it followed the first book perfectly looking forward to the next two
Feb 15 2015,positive,anastasia ana steele is a 21yearold college senior attending washington state university in vancouver washington with her best friend katherine kate kavanagh who writes for the student newspaper due to an illness kate persuades ana to take her place and interview 27yearold christian grey an incredibly successful and wealthy young entrepreneur in seattle ana is instantly attracted to christian but also finds him intimidating as a result she stumbles through the interview asking questions about his personal life and relationships and leaves christians office believing that it went badly ana tries to console herself thinking the two of them will probably never meet again however she is surprised when christian appears at claytons the largest independent hardware store in the portland area where she works while he purchases various items including cable ties masking tape and rope ana informs christian that kate would like some photographs to go along with her article about him christian leaves ana with his phone number later that day kate urges ana to call christian and arrange a photo shoot with their photographer friend josé rodriguez    the next day josé kate and ana arrive for the photo shoot at the heathman hotel where christian is staying and christian asks ana out for coffee the two talk over coffee and christian asks ana if shes dating anyone specifically josé when ana replies that she isnt dating anyone christian begins to ask her about her family during the conversation ana learns that christian is also single but is not a hearts and flowers kind of guy this warning intrigues ana especially after he pulls her out of the path of an oncoming cyclist however ana believes that she is not attractive enough for christian much to the chagrin of kate after finishing her exams ana receives a package from christian containing first edition copies of tess of the durbervilles which stuns her later that night ana goes out drinking with her friends and ends up drunk dialing christian who informs her that he will be coming to pick her up because of her inebriated state ana goes outside to get some fresh air and josé attempts to kiss her but he is stopped by christians arrival ana leaves with christian but not before she discovers that kate has been flirting with christians brother elliot later ana wakes to find herself in christians hotel room where he scolds her for not taking proper care of herself christian then reveals that he would like to have sex with her he initially says that ana will first have to fill out paperwork but later goes back on this statement after making out with her in the elevator
Feb 15 2015,negative,50 shades of 50 minutes dragged out at first the movie starts off as expected mild comedy and introductions shortly into it your thinking about whats on the horizon waiting for the movie to pick up it never does the sex scenes were mediocrity at its finest the movie leaves you wanting more even to the ending scene however once out the theater you realized 50 bucks to watch an abc special not what you expected
Feb 15 2015,negative,if i wanted to watch a porno i would save your time and money and log onto pornhub
Feb 15 2015,neutral,how about this how about a screenwriter take on a book that captures the ideas and direction of the book long story but tailors the story to fit into a movie length and context unfortunately in this adaptation of fifty shades of grey we get way too much checklisting from the book at the expense of a cohesive flowing narrative written to create an absorbing movie going experience      original writer el james joins three other writers in the scripting of her famous book about love versus sexual obsession unfortunately what we experience in this movie is a constant jarring jolt of moments when points of the book are brought up to remind the audience that they have already read this story having read the book myself i felt pandered to not serviced by the constant niggling little points that keep coming up even when they arent needed if they had structured similar ideas with a little creative flair and fewer instances then perhaps we could see not the adaptation of  fifty shades of grey but instead fifty shades of grey the movie it can be done       actors jamie doran and dakota johnson are well cast as the movies two main leads and each has a special quality that makes their roles effective johnson is titular in the girl next door role and performs well with a few moments of backbone which are refreshing and appropriate doran is steely and intense with magnetic eyes which make up for a lack of bulk in his physical presence but since his heroine is smallish herself this is a minor point      other characters either seem less developed like anastasias buddy kate who is simply the shakespearian sounding board for anas inner thoughts to be relayed to the audience and not much of a  point of potential conflict as she was in the book while other characters seem cliched versions of what has gone before and were meant to fit into a type as were the actors chosen to portray them ie the divorce mom the lower class suitor the rowdy trouble making brother ho hum but this is just one more instance of the paint by numbers movie construction    there are of course quite a few sex scenes as there would be in such a production they do help to complete the visual narrative from the book in all its soft core salacious excess though visually stunning in its presentation lush and evocative it brings an interesting contrast to an underlying psychological problem that permeates the movie as a whole that being i think best summed up in a question when it comes to love and sex who is master and who is slave which one leads and which one follows one would automatically know the answer to this in a civilized society but to make a study of it requires a definitive answer that will only be socially responsible considering the public welfare of such things when balancing between the banal truth of life and the attempt to capitalize on the publics penchant for spending money on sensationalism    anastasia of course has deep attraction for the mysterious rich fellow who shows up in her life and turns it upside down as love is want to do to the average work a day girl or cinderella    christian grey finds this simple student and hardware store worker girl an actual challenge to his life filled with financial excess choppers and gliders a garage full of expensive cars and a huge expensively outfitted home  which is sadly and not coincidentally empty     fruits of ones labor being true to form success takes work often too much work and only decorates the walls of ones life while leaving what could be the creamy center void in this way christians obsession for the lurid sexual life that he finds himself in is a double edge sword of kink idolatry     he is revealed to be a liar on several moments of personal revelation once the brutal terminal ending arrives as the commitment to sex over love proves to be too much even in the face of the love that promises that the marriage bed is not defiled     anastasias hopeful risky challenge has all sorts of hidden subtext as she tests the heart of her suitor only to find his psychology an horrific fit and a vile insult to her own heart and emotions the ending something akin to a slamming door had the audience in the theater gasping and moaning in disbelief my own response yeah well this isnt the internet folks    three out of five stars
Feb 15 2015,negative,this was a godawful piece of shit dont bother
Feb 15 2015,positive,very romantic love story
Feb 15 2015,negative,i cringed through the entire movie i read all the books to see what the fuss wad about i felt about the movie the same way i felt about the books creepy this isnt romance its abuse
Feb 15 2015,negative,fifty shades of grey  f  proof that you should never underestimate the stupidity of american film executives and the audiences they rip off  one of the worst  unsexy books in decades is turned into an unsexy film with a zero chemistry cast  but it opens to 90m classic
Feb 15 2015,positive,scenes are very choppy  but overall with having read the book overall a good movie  excited for sequel talk
Feb 15 2015,negative,i never read the books and its not my kind of film but i got caught up in the zeitgeist so i took in a matinee  yes it was ridiculous but just an age old riff on the mousey but smart and ernest girl using the power of love to turn around a tortured and hurting man who expresses himself through pain i found dakota johnson to be quite earnest and likable and although jamie dornan is beautiful and cuts a great figure in a suit hes terribly boring and for the most part so is the filmalthough a group of women in the audience laughed a lot  if you are going for the sex and bdsm youll find more on late night hbo ill pass on the sequels
Feb 15 2015,negative,this movie totally misrepresents the bdsm community as boring i havent read the books but had to sate my curiosity so i opted for the movie slow pointless slog not to mention it portrays bdsm as something poisoned people do to abuse others consent respect and mutual pleasure are the cornerstones of bdsm this movie portrays a spineless girl being pushed around by a crazy asshole and hes not even that cute
Feb 15 2015,negative,this film had no character development what so ever but lets face it we did not show up for the plot the only thing i can say that was positive about this movie was that the lighting was good  other than that my advice is go see something else
Feb 15 2015,negative,this was the worst movie ive seen in 22 years jamie dornan has to be the worst actor ive ever known have such a global role in a massive film dakota johnson was the only decent part of this movie it was hard to sit through and if it wasnt for my wife i would have left
Feb 15 2015,negative,well i picked the wrong film to go see in 4d i spilt my coke twice and still cant find where they stuck my cornetto
Feb 15 2015,positive,this movie is very very good i have been wanting to see this for a while finally got to see it and recommend to everyone who has a special someone it definitely will jump start the romance back into your relationship 
Feb 15 2015,negative,this is fifty shades of fucked up
Feb 15 2015,neutral,this wasnt a good movie it wasnt like the book at all i felt bad for her
Feb 15 2015,positive,i thought this was worth seeing if youve read the books i do think there should have been a different director and script writer because they went soft on the whole thing vs the book was very graphic and descriptive i thought the actors were great and the movie was very funny in the beginning but the ending wasnt really what i wanted i will go see the other two movies if they make them because i love the books very much i recommend this movie if you love the books and go in knowing that of course the movie isnt going to be exactly like the books
Feb 15 2015,negative,okay i got dragged along to this film  it really had a lot of pressure to live up to the book of the same name by author el james and its hoard of mainly middle aged female fanatics  the antics of a high flying seattle based businessman christian grey  grey doesnt sleep in the same bed as women he describes himself as fifty shades fucked up  the film is like one of those smutty mills and boon books that your relative used to read whilst baby sitting you in your childhood  here it concerns some coming of sexual age female character anastasia steele becoming embroiled in the dominant bdsm life of grey complete with a play room a red room of pain  this review makes the film sound pornographic which it isnt its just a lurid tale of sexual innuendo  the film has ample screenplay material a trio of books and it ends set up for a sequel  grey is obsessed with drawing up a contract for ana the contract forms the backbone of the film for a good twenty minutes raising laughs along the way with its lurid contents being discussed in a boardroom like an episode of the apprentice   that is all i have to add
Feb 15 2015,negative,there is no plot a waste of money and two hours of your life you wont get back
Feb 15 2015,positive,was better than the book i actually think and there were some actually very funny parts
Feb 15 2015,positive,there was way too much detail left out of this book including the sex scenes where was the first oral scene and where he shaves her hairy vagina where was the palm twitching anna appearance is what i envisioned i think that some of the boring dry sex wouldve been better with hotter dom this is no christian gray if they want  books 23 to hold up they need  to make a bigger and more domineering mr gray i laughed at the sex areas there was no sense of scare the 3 rating is for the setting and other things that did illuminate the book
Feb 15 2015,negative,apparently this movie is a step up from the book i couldnt tell either way this movie despite all of the sex is still boring boring boring the cinematography is great the soundtrack is awesome the wardrobes are fun to look at but though all of those things are important they dont make a good movie while the main actors are good at acting they really lack on the chemistry that is essential to pull off any film let alone a relationshipdriven romance like this should be there just arent any sparks also a lot of the lines pulled directly from the book are cringe worthy they should have just stayed where they were ultimately this movie just cant live up to the hype this film is 50 shades of dull
Feb 15 2015,positive,read every book and loved this movie the characters were totally captured and everyone in the theatre was left wanting more which is exactly what the first book does for you cant wait for the sequels
Feb 15 2015,positive,lots of harsh reviews out there but it isnt so bad the acting wanders about in quality from atrocious falling over at the start was like a scene from a school play to quite convincing did i believe the characters of course not is the story well written is it heck but its still a watchable film ive seen much much worse
Feb 15 2015,negative,for once twilight had a better love story
Feb 15 2015,positive,somewhat off from the bookbut a good movie
Feb 15 2015,positive,saw this film and was pleasantly entertained there was humor tension and did the book justice i think the casting was done well and am looking forward to the next installment i am not surprised that there are many negative reviews many by those who have never read or are not fans of the books i agree a great film should stand for its self however no one should have been expecting a cinematic classic this was done way better than twilight and with so much hype it beat my expectations if you liked the books you will love the movie its that simple
Feb 15 2015,negative,film is filled with intimate partner violence
Feb 15 2015,negative,talk about a misrepresentation of the lifestyle what total crap
Feb 15 2015,negative,disappointment after waiting 2 years definitely sounds have waited for charlie on this one dont bother making any more with jamie in it
Feb 15 2015,negative,i would give it a 3 out of 5 if it wasnt insultingly selfcensored not as horrible as most people say
Feb 15 2015,negative,this movie has no redeeming qualities after going into the movie expecting to at the very least be entertained i left feeling depressed and confused as to why anyone would see these one dimensional characters as romantic idols the character of christian grey is at no time romantcally appealing and consistently left me feeling disgusted the fantasy created by these characters is vapid emotionally unfulfilling and ina way traumatic the fans that helped the books succeed and helped create this movie may be in need of therapy as they must be as emotionally and romantically stunted as the characters they so admire
Feb 15 2015,negative,it kills me that i actually paid money to see this movie dont make the same mistake i did
Feb 15 2015,negative,read all the books the books are amazing and addicting but when i saw the movie it literally felt like i was watching a parody to the book such a joke i was so disappointed there was no build up not to mention barely any background music nothing flowed kind of seemed like they threw scenes together cause nothing was built up the acting wasnt so awesome sigh just a letdown
Feb 15 2015,negative,fifty shades of grey is a movie about the two most boring people on the planet whining about their differences for two hours with dialogue so stale youd think george lucas wrote it other than that its hysterical
Feb 15 2015,positive,didnt expect much so was pleasantly surprised thought it stayed along the lines of the book ana was cast well i thought but a definite miscasting on christiandidnt think he was sexy at all not much chemistry between the characters unfortunately saying that i still enjoyed the film
Feb 15 2015,negative,i can only say redbox or netflix crappy ending great cinematography awesome soundtrack and a blind director the movie company should be shot for the shortcuts and shoddiness of the movie
Feb 15 2015,negative,the worst book to film adaptation since harry potter  the goblet of fire and a front runner at next years razzies  vital elements from the book are either watered down or removed all for some of the most unromantic sex ever put on film  theres no chemistry between the leads and supporting actors to flesh them out are relegated to walkons  dakota johnson works as ana but jamie dornan fails completely as grey  instead of being an enigma with a mysterious childhood hes a jerk and a bore  if the sequels are filmed lets hope they are direct to video  subjecting the public to them would truly be an exercise in sm
Feb 15 2015,positive,in truth i went to see the movie prepared to be disappointed but i was wrong  as far as a sexxed up hea it worked and it worked well  and it was sooooooo much better than the first twilight movie  dakota was awesome in this movie and it should be watched for that reason alone  as far as the bdsm stuff for people to compare it with violence against women clearly they either have not read the book nor seen the movie  i could write oodles here but what is the point  it is a good moviesee it for yourself and be your own judge
Feb 15 2015,negative,if you were to base ones opinion on the knowledge that this movie was already doomed to fail its origins being a book with dull drab alliteration horrid allegory and horrid misconceptions toward the world of bdsm then the movie itself is passable however this is not what a review is for the movie shyly alludes toward its origins with hints of what is supposed to be bdsm played by a cast of twilight wannabes ironic as that may be yet it still manages to reveal the misconstrued views toward a sexual world views that are just as warped as the author of the original book may be any half brained attempt at romance is lost to the supposedly wild and crazy sex that happens in the film yet the film lacks what is expected by bored rabid fans of this book series the horrid attempts at bdsm dont watch this movie this movie is twilight for those with a lack of knowledge of bdsm it is the transformers 4 of chic flicks overplayed boring and a waste of money
Feb 15 2015,positive,i have not read the books but i have to say that i was very skeptical about this movie but i really loved it  having not read the book does it make a difference most likely i rarely like movies when i have read the books because everyone envisions a book in their own imaginations that said the whole 120 minutes i was not bored and it was intense and rummaged a lot of emotions happy mad sad disappointment hopefulness i have to say that i really liked it
Feb 15 2015,positive,captured the tone of the book what else are people expecting a movie different from the book i liked it
Feb 15 2015,positive,my pointers on fifty shades of grey  1 change directors  she made it too soft   2 change script writers  add more dialogue   all in all i loved the movie but id like the second one to be more intense because thats what makes the series more intense 
Feb 15 2015,negative,this movie lacked so much but they were character building the book as always was much better but maybe they will surprise us with the second movie i was not impressed at all they made it out to be something that it wasnt and i felt cheated at the end i absolutely hated the main characters chemistry there wasnt anything there at all it may have been better with different people  if i had known that it was going to be like that i wouldnt have paid money for it i would have waited to watch it on netflix for free
Feb 15 2015,positive,whoever says this isnt a good movie is just afraid to admit they liked it the acting was extremely believable and i felt the connection between ana and christian from the very first minute i didnt read the books but my wife did and said the movie was almost like the book and she was pleasantly surprised the whole theatre seemed to really enjoy the film thats why i dont believe people saying they hated it its just easier to talk negative about something and not having to admit you liked something that seems so strange and wrong to a lot of people
Feb 15 2015,negative,crap writing reigns supreme the book was horribly written and the movie  i refuse to spend money on this its a shame true erotica is not getting seen this author is a hack
Feb 15 2015,positive,those that enjoyed the books will love the movie
Feb 15 2015,neutral,it was not what i expected that movie to be
Feb 15 2015,negative,fails as a drama and fails as soft core porn  i have seen better character development and erotic sex scenes at 2 am on cinemax and showtime  they should have made this an eight your mini series on hbo  they left out way too much trying to squeeze the book into a 2 hour movie
Feb 15 2015,negative,if i could rate no stars i would this was literally an overrated censored bondage porn with half a story with a really bad script
Feb 15 2015,negative,absolutely a waste of money the worst book to movie possibly ever acting was very poor it doesnt lead you in the direction of the relationship as the books do
Feb 15 2015,negative,based on other reviews on how rotten it is i will give my words on the matter however that according to adam fendelman that it dangerously dramatizes sexual violence and glamorizes domestic abuse you know things you can get arrested for in real life and this movie tries to make us think oh thats okay that is my biggest problem with this movie as a whole outside of it being boring while its not exploiting greys domestic abuse fetish if you dont care about the sex or major issues it suffers from then the movie will most likely lull you to sleep and the fact they chose valentines day to release this is sickeningly coincidental    this movie tries and fails to regularize abusive relationships and make us think that staying in an abusive relationship for the abusers benefit is okay to do in real life completely skews the perspective of a reallife bdsm relationship the title character grey has no charm or likability outside of his money and corrupt power and steele is boring and doesnt know better all this movie is is just twilights leftovers for adults with no vampires more kinky bedroom scenes and a worse supporting actress yes i find twilights lovetriangle story between the girl the vampire and the werewolf and the actress in those movies to be more believable than this trash adaptation from an already morallyill book that is the reason this gets only a half star it is worse than twilights love story as it promotes even glorifies sexual abuse and even rape whereas twilight was just a subsubpar love story set in fiction this is not fiction this does happen in real life and this movie wants us to think these actions are okay things to do in which they are not no matter how rich and powerful you think you are    while some may say it is one of the few exceptions that its better than the book that is not the point both movie and book series glorify and glamorize sexual physical and emotional abuse especially in moments where steele is unable to consent which leads to essentially rape and if theres any plans of making the other 2 books into movies then god help us talk to anyone that has read the book extensively to point out these morethandisturbing moments theyll tell you why it is a bad read and why this movie is a rotten watch i find the edited movie posters on tumblr to be more entertaining to the eyes
Feb 15 2015,negative,crazy story would be a good movie with better dialogs nobody talks like this
Feb 15 2015,negative,the best part of the movie was the start of the end credits and the reaction moans of disbelief from the women in the theater
Feb 15 2015,negative,ill be honest this is without a doubt the worst movie of all time ill admit i still hate movies like ouija catwoman and felix the cat the movie much much more considering the audience this movie was aimed at horny teens and couples looking for new ways to have sex but objectively its the worst there is welcome to rock bottom people go see kingsman instead its much better
Feb 15 2015,negative,well it was written a lot better than the book but still terrible
Feb 15 2015,negative,in more than one way this movie is ass
Feb 15 2015,negative,left out a lot of important parts of the book
Feb 15 2015,negative,the blandest most vanilla adaptation possible only serving to accentuate how poorly written the novel was offensive to the senses and not in a good way dakota johnson as ana is the only positive as for jamie dornan i was done after he said his first line
Feb 15 2015,positive,watched this valentines night with brett absolutely brilliant well worth seeing
Feb 15 2015,negative,50 shades of grey wasnt just a bad movie it goes beyond that it was for lack of a better wordwrong it was wrong on many levels  calling it soft core porn with a world wide release is selling it short yes it was that but it also it was a personification of everything that is wrong with modernday female sexual preference it was an enormous steaming pile of hypocrisy it was not just immoral it was antilove it was antigod it was abusive gender roles on full display for the world to see and it was thee very definition of the ignorant superficiality in spite of better judgment just like every woman that is abused by a man yet continues to come back to him because he has this or he has that money possessions  good looks luxury security ect  ect   on top of all that its not telling the story for the female target audience to see that and learn a lesson and understand that it is wrong and learn a lesson to see aspects of real life played out on a bigger scale so that they can relate to this story and see how it plays out on a much smaller scale in their real life its not dynamic like that at all no  nothing about 50 shades of greys story is dynamic at all much like christian grey it is very singular   in 2015 thanks to the likes of celebrities like chris brown and ray rice men abusing women has become the new hot topic which it should be spousal abuse is a problem that is way out of control and its nothing new psas do nothing to stop this you want to stop the violent physicality of men on women thats something that men have to do by being real men good men it takes good fathers like the one i have to teach that 50 shades of grey once again is a steaming pile of hypocrisy that sets back any progress as if there were any to stop spousal abuse it doesnt encourage it so to speak but it says in a loud clear resounding voice its okay because which is wrong on so many levels as i said because its not ok its never ok the character of christian grey shouldnt be revered he should be denounced i dont care how rich or good looking or how big his damn helicopter is he is a villain and he should be presented as such what is wrong with people to quote bono every beauty need to go out with an idiot how can you stand next to the truth and not see it   christian grey the character who should be a villain is instead the hero the object of desire my fiancée compared him to the character of count dracula but with all due respect to her shes way off base in that comparison no count dracula was a villain absolutely positively a villain he was a demon incarnate that received his comeuppance and it was very well established that he was evil and both mina and lucy before her were bewitched by the counts evil forces he was destroyed as he should be christian grey is not presented this way at all hes the object of desire the audience is to try and reach for understanding for his character when they should be reaching for a metaphorical wooden stake to drive through his heart or they should literally be reaching for their coats as they get up and walk out of the theater 45 minutes into the movie   as if this wasnt reason enough for the film and book for that matter to get a poor review it also has very lousy acting and a plot as thin as a dollar store paper towel  anybody that paid to see this movie should be ashamed of themselves i know i am
Feb 15 2015,positive,excellent rendition of the book except christian grey i dont know how to feel about him in this movie i just didnt imagine someone to plain to play him i suppose
Feb 15 2015,negative,fifty shades of grey more like fifty shades of abuse    the story is about a literature student interviews the wealthy intimidating christian grey and instantly develops an attraction to the enigmatic man grey is likewise drawn to ana  but will only agree to a relationship on his own terms both will discover a place where want and desire intersect    fifty shades of grey was a movie that i had zone interested in because i was in that bad mood where if i see a best selling novel being made into a movie which is a cliche now and now there did it with fifty shades of grey which by the way the book sucked ass yeah i red the book and i had no idea why it was a best seller its basically porn on paper whats more annoying is in the uk there are people on the radio and everyone i met who was looking forward to this movie and my question is why the people on the radio keep making top stories about it making it the hot headline and im here thinking thats really new worthy theres loads of usual but amazing things happening around the world and this peace of shit makes the headline my hope for humility is slowly fading away and thats not all im not kidding you here but there actually made a headline of its reviews its getting and this never happened before when it comes to movies so after seeing fifty shades of grey i can say its not as bad as people say its actually a lot worse then i thought    now let me give you the positive things in this movie dakota johnson was the only good actress in this movie she did what she can do with a god awful script that she had and shes the only one in this movie that gives it her all the movie is shot really good as well it fitted the movie very well but besides that all those good things cant hind the fact that this is a abomination against humanity it brings shame to cinema and it should be burn in hell    now lets talk about mr grey the psychopath now i got to ask you this what do women see in this guy i mean his not charming at all his cold hes kind of a asshole and what he wants to do is hurt you with sex and the actor himself isnt really that good at all and she doesnt enjoy it she only does it to make him feel good so in the sex scenes shes not enjoying it shes getting hurt by this guy and after a while she gets crossed with him and then she runs off then starts to have thoughts about him and how she needs a man in her life so she goes back    the writing in this movie i dont know if its for comic relief or to be taken seriously because the writing in this movie was absolutely atrocious and its the most cheesiest dialogue ever put to film its twilight dialogue bad    now is this worse than twilight and i cant believe im saying this but yes it is i found a movie thats more awful and more laughable than twilight i hated this movie i hated it i hated it i hated it this is the worst movie of 2015 i cant wait to forget this film you better off seeing kingsman the secret service i havent see it myself yet but at least that movie looks well made and effort went into it
Feb 15 2015,negative,did not meat my expectations go with your hopes low then youll enjoy it
Feb 15 2015,negative,i didnt want to say anything while my girlfriend was around but this is one of the worst movies ive ever seen it was so messy and spotty that i was outraged not to mention i laughed way more than im sure i should have its gets half a star for getting this shit idea past everyone
Feb 15 2015,positive,loved it  very much to the bring  if you liked the books you will like the movie  really brought it to life
Feb 15 2015,negative,my first flixter review after using the app for years i never knew sex could be so boring this movie had me feeling like i couldnt wait for it to end
Feb 15 2015,negative,for a movie with such anticipation it ended up being a huge bore and a waste of time can i have my 28 back please seriously it had no plot no climax and ended in the most awkward scene major let down
Feb 15 2015,negative,the movie had a promising start but halfway thru you go    zzzzzz   
Feb 15 2015,positive,having read the book  i really enjoyed the movie and how it was filmed
Feb 15 2015,positive,loved it it was great cant wait for the sequels
Feb 15 2015,negative,it wasnt as steamy as i thought the lead roles were good just the story line was bad the ending was good and it ended when it was suppose to
Feb 15 2015,positive,the movie was intense  i went with my boyfriend who has never read the books  i myself have only read the first book and i thought the onscreen chemistry was definitely there i cant wait for the next one i also thought the sex scenes were tastefully done graphic enough to arouse your kinky desires  however censored enough to not be portrayed as a porno jamie dornan is very intense with his sexy bad boy model faces he makes
Feb 15 2015,positive,dakota did an amazing job as ana and jamie although not too convincing he did a good job i felt like the film was rushed and it lacked depth moving from one scene to the other in some parts some important details to the story were eliminated and conversations between ana and christian were too brief and lacked some emotion being that fifty shades books were such a huge phenomenon i expected more of the story details projected in the film and wouldve gladly enjoyed a longer film with all these details in it i liked it and enjoyed it but i really hope they put more effort into the plot for fifty shades darker and fifty shades freed
Feb 15 2015,negative,awful the books were well written but the movie is terrible and thats not even mentioning the fact the message it is sending about women on the whole both the book and movie glorifies abusing women but that is besides the point the acting sucks the whole movie just sucks dont waste your money   i would have rated it a negative star rating but the system wouldnt allow me to
Feb 15 2015,negative,can i give this 0 stars monotone acting and voices no plot and the actors and actresses left a lot to be desired fail
Feb 15 2015,negative,the movie is an excuse to exploit period
Feb 15 2015,positive,i loved the movie as well as the books  i found the movie to be funny charming and tasteful  i loved the characters who acted beautifully  i would recommend this movie to friends and family  it was so close to the book  it was well worth it for me
Feb 15 2015,negative,fifty shades of grey commits the greatest entertainment sin  its boring
Feb 15 2015,positive,i think people are being way too critical of this movie lets face it the book was not written well but the story is intriguing and hard to put down the movie just followed the book and i thought the characters did a fine job for all the awkward scenes and lines there are a lot of really bad movies out therelike anything with melissa mccarthy in it but i dont think this is one of them i also noticed that  most of the bad reviews were posted by men they just dont get the appeal of this for women
Feb 15 2015,positive,had too many highlights from the book and left out the storyline
Feb 15 2015,positive,i loved it i dont understand what all the negative fuss is perhaps its the closed minded judgemental world we live in it was beautifully and tastefully done in my opinion
Feb 15 2015,negative,so we just watched the 50 shades movie ill save you some trouble accept for the lead actress  b grade script and acting the bdsm scenes were done well but the story line around them not so much
Feb 15 2015,negative,this movie in my opinion was one of the worst movies i have ever seen i went with some coworkers and only because i had a voucher so i didnt pay for anything but the popcorn basically i looked at it as sending out mixed messages and eventhough the female character did not sign the consent form to be used as the submissive she allowed him to do so anyhow and ended up with hurt feelings and rump no big shock she must have never watched any of the maury povichtype shows or read any dear abby columns she would have been better off just renting a few porn movies it may be that i am too old to appreciate the virgin college student thinking an act of rape is sexylove not being into bondage probably makes me jaded towards this as well im sure there will be women who disagree cest la vie but i suggest you save your money im sure there are far better movies out now
Feb 15 2015,negative,terribly written boring story bad acting the end
Feb 15 2015,positive,4 starsit a chick flickbut we felt ver  y goodshows the dark mr grey w his obsessions n dominanceyet sweet innocenceannanot a love story but a movie of controlending i hatedwe were just getting into it wellthendone
Feb 15 2015,negative,boring i wasnt even interested in the sex scenes after the first one   and i had to wait in line to get in sit in the theater with about a hundred middle aged women and their friends cackling on and off throughout the movie sorry i didnt read the books i loved when my wife was reading them and was lost when the audience would laugh or oooo and ahhh at strange times everyone left the theater very quietly   im not an expert this is my opinion the actors were all good and the story is not a bad one but the writersdirectorproducers made a snooze fest
Feb 15 2015,negative,the rrated version of twilight 50 shades of grey offers nothing except cheesy dialogue embarrassing scenes of eroticism and pretentious scenery of romance   the move is based on the novel of the same name by rl james the movie is about a naïve girl named anastasia played by dakota johnson whom falls in love with a rich billionaire christian grey portrayed by jamie dornan after a bizarre interview she makes for her friend mr grey seems to be interested in anastasia but he doesnt do romance and makes her enter a relationship of bdsm and as for the rest of the film is him trying to convince her to sign a contract of dominant and submissive   even do i had low expectations of this movie is one of those type of movies its so bad is good because how hilarious they cheesy the lines are the interview scene is just a corny scene in getting these two hallow characters together me and the audience was literally laughing at almost every line they were saying the characters were literally lifeless they didnt have a lot of chemistry up to the point you ask yourself and how did these 2 ended up together not only that the movie screams twilight all over the place a naïve girl falls in love with a man whom has more power than she has at first he tells her to back off hes not the right man for her and out of no reason he comes back and start of a weird bizarre illogical reason   even though the movie was fastpaced there were some scenes which were so slow and boring that i almost fall asleep now this movie is not as disturbing as the book the book has more bdsm scenes and sure even though the movie has it when the movie ended i was expecting something more from it it looks like they played it safe   now even though the movie has preposterous writing the acting is surprisingly good dakota johnson steals the show as this young naïve girl whom is trying to have a normal relationship with mr grey and shes not so easily converted into his sex slave and jamie dornan does an excellent job portraying the unemotional coldhearted bastard mr grey even though these dont have any chemistry the cinematography looks great that makes 2 or 3 scenes really beautiful music and songs are great but the problem with the movie it lacks originality and chemistry   i cant recommend this movie to anyone except to people that love twilight and are fans of the books because this movie will bore you down cause is nothing more than an rrated version of twilight worst valentines movie ever
Feb 15 2015,positive,exceeded my expectations
Feb 15 2015,positive,havent read the books but i enjoyed it and would watch it again
Feb 15 2015,negative,worst film ive ever seen no story line no character development no adversity unlike able characters
Feb 15 2015,neutral,fifty shades of grey has suffered from its publicity i have not read the book but feel its an interesting concept for the big screen yet it fails to live up to its hype its an interesting romance movie more so than hundreds before it yet it falls flat mostly due to an abrupt ending and repetitive scenes towards the end the connection and aura was evident and perhaps as a trilogy it will work the storyline remained tasteful even if it is pretentious and it had some charm enough to prevent a total flop
Feb 15 2015,positive,i thought 50 shades of grey was tastefully done there was more of a focus on the storyline and not just the sex overall i cant wait for the sequel
Feb 15 2015,negative,got dragged by the wife to it  had hopes it wouldnt be bad awful  it wasnt the worst i have seen but there are issues  i had no connection with the actors and some of the scenes were very forced like where she trips out the elevator i have seen better trips in a snl skit  there would be times when ana would be crying and i find myself asking why  the lack of an over arcing story line disappointed me too  seemed like they were just throwing dialogue to get to the bdsm scenes which i also found no connection with i mean the instantaneous moaningugh   there were glimpses of a good movie where i found myself interested but there were so few of those that i cannot give this anymore than a 2
Feb 15 2015,negative,glamourized porn it is
Feb 15 2015,negative,creepy rapey vapid twilight fanficbased rubbish glorifying a predatory relationship under the house of  romance
Feb 15 2015,negative,not exciting at all extremely boring poor developed characters too simple and lineal story
Feb 15 2015,positive,i loved this movie  i have saw it twice already and will go again before it leaves the cinema i loved the books now i love the movie it isnt the best movie of all time of course but for entertainment and a want to see it again oh and the sheer excitement of the trilogy  its a massive thumbs up from me i love the characters and feel like i knew them already  mr grey is finding his feet in this 1st part and i believe as the films go on  we will see a well rounded acting performance from dornan as for ana  well johnson got it spot on fabulous 
Feb 15 2015,negative,the actors did a good enough job trying to portray difficult characters but the end was awfully unsatisfying
Feb 15 2015,positive,i loved it as a fan of the books i was pleased how the movie turned out dakota was perfect for the role  it ended just like the book so if you didnt read it that might disappoint you
Feb 15 2015,positive,it was a very good movie
Feb 15 2015,positive,i think if you havent read the book you should
Feb 15 2015,negative,dont waste your time on this one
Feb 15 2015,positive,crikey ive given it 4 stars   btw that hardware store has much more stock variety than my local bq
Feb 15 2015,positive,despite bad reviews it did not disappoint it was a good adaptation of the book and all our friends agreed it was an entertaining movie
Feb 15 2015,positive,loved every second of the film âºï
Feb 15 2015,negative,i am soo disappointed in this flick dakota johnson did an awesome job thats my 1st positive my 2nd and final positive is that the storyline followed the 1st book exactly now with that being said why do none of the other characters looked as described in the book why especially does christian grey not look like christian grey why is there no chemistry between the twoain characters at all and why was i bored during the sexy scenes you bettter come better and stronger for the second movie if you want to keep your fans i personally would fire the csa and recast everyone except dakota the guy who plays taylor and her stepdad ooh yeah and fire the director too because she obviously never read the books or saw the lack of chemistry through her lens
Feb 15 2015,negative,acting and directing was ridiculously horrible
Feb 15 2015,positive,read bad critics in general for that movie but i enjoyed it i guess my expectations were not too high as i have not read the books yet was expecting more intense scenes though as people have talked so much about it loved the soundtrack loved the ending which mirrors a former scene in the movie
Feb 15 2015,negative,the picture shamelessly disrespects the cinematic art   the sloppy writing the lack of chemistry between the characters the absurdity of the story the whole idea of the movie existing is a mystery  40 million dollars went into the making of it and by the looks of the box office statistics the movie will be successful it does not deserve it  it is one step under twilight and that was thought to be impossible
Feb 15 2015,positive,it was surprisingly good the movie was intense and different then the books they didnt put as much of sx scenes in as i thought and that shows the plot the actor were really good and i would recommend it
Feb 15 2015,negative,should of been a lifetime movie
Feb 15 2015,positive,i think the new 50 shades of gray movie was really good
Feb 15 2015,negative,50 shades of grey was by far the worst movie i have seen in theatre ive seen a lot of movies that are made from books and they do a fairly good job but this movie was nothing like that it fucked up the book completely and ive read the trilogy it was no where near as steamy and interesting the lead character who played christian was bland and boring the girls was one dimensional not that cute no body and liked to bite her lip wayyyyy too much and the sex scenes were lacking chemistry as well as horrible bdsm  were boring as hell to watch everybody in my theatre kept laughing or talked amongst themselves about how bad this movie was it simply could not keep peoples attention the movie was terrible  a gigantic waste of money i got my money back as did a few other people  05 out of 5
Feb 15 2015,negative,taylor johnsons eagerly anticipated film version ofâ e l james bestsellingâ novel fifty shades of grey is rushed clumsy bland and downright ackward although not entirely convinced was it intending to be hilarious
Feb 15 2015,positive,for those about to say its the worst movie ever because it didnt live up to the books well fantasy never lives up to reality   im rating this on movie only did the movie leave me wanting more yes and thats good because there are more of them planned  the movie does a good job introducing the characters and introducing people to the playroom  its sets the foundation for the next movie   this movie was never meant to be porn if you want that then there are websites to go to  i personally enjoyed the story and the pace it was set at
Feb 15 2015,negative,im not sure what all the hype is about ive never read the book and know very little about but this movie was very predictable the acting was horrific could have changed some camera angles and it would have been a lifetime movie and the video for 30 seconds to mars hurricane was more sexually enticing as a matter of fact why didnt they ask jared leto to star and direct
Feb 15 2015,negative,this film is poorif your expecting it to be like the books you will be very disappointed
Feb 15 2015,negative,its mediocre at best   the raciest scenes were of anas breasts and when christian told ana that he doesnt make love he fucks hard   ive seen far sexier movies in the past   abuse  lmao  whatever   its a fiction movie go pick any movie  there are tons available about rape and abuse if thats what you want to watch andor bitch about stfu about it
Feb 15 2015,neutral,note any time i refer to a this is where a link was posted on another review site cause this is copypasted and i cant copy links    final film in my three film extravaganza    instead of writing a complicated review for this somewhat impressive but emotionallydevoid picture ill jut provide a number of fleeting thoughts that passed through my mind throughout the viewing    many have used this metaphor but ill slightly adjust it you cant polish a shit a shit is a shit no matter how many times you roll it in glitter this makes it a good looking shit but a shit nonetheless but there are still too many people discrediting the fact that this shit still looks good if you are rating this a half star or even one star you are basically saying fuck you to the cinematographer seamus mcgarvey whose work is out of this world exceptional if this film was solely storyboards then id give it a ten out of ten    unfortunately the words in that storyboard still need to be spoken aloud because this is a film and the performances part dakota johnson who tries so very hard despite the screenplay and male lead trying to fuck her over every step of the way are some of the worst ive ever seen you see this stick it possesses more acting range and emotional capacity than jamie dornan who pretty much serves his role as a hot guy and nothing else i couldve given a more convincing performance whenever hes whacking his lady friend on the ass despite his claims he looks like he fucking hates it character consistency people    and the lines omigod the dialogue is amazing i want to fuck you into next week im not kidding i laughed for about half a minute and everyone in the theatre was looking at me did i give a shit of course not theyre the people at fault if anything if theyre not laughing at such an atrocity its their loss    look i dont care what freaky sexual preference or fetish you possess everyone has one whether it be that youre into necrophilia bestiality or bdsm although i gather most are into things less out there than those examples youre entitled to getting off on whatever gets you off as long as its consensual and not hurting anyone in an unpleasant way but christian grey the male lead here is just so lacking the whole thing about the movie is that he gets off on hurting anastasia steele thats a porn name in the making and you know it that hitting her and tormenting her in a sexual form means greater pleasure for him and her but when he looks like hes not actually having any fun mainly because he never does any face part once or twice that departs from this it takes away the pleasure for the audience member lets be honest a great portion of the viewership for this monstrosity will be people who just want to get a little hot and bothered in the sexual manner of course but if you cant get hot and bothered because the male lead looks like he fucking hates what hes doing its a bit redundant    the entire theatre smelt like my grandma but in the worst way possible not in the homely family way in the old way it formed the basis for a really awkward viewing experience    initiate rant mode    but as ive made mention im angry at people who give this film anything below a two i watch the australian today show and as im sure youve heard one of the lead presenters said this was the worst film shes ever seen first shes seen that requires a visual counterpart and the visual form of the picture or more so the production structure which includes cinematography score lighting production design makeup costumes etc which contributes to half of my rating for any given picture was absolutely perfect it was crisp emotional powerful i was floored by some of the silent scenes where the lighting the score and the camera position were virtually all that it was required to provide a serene and beautiful moment one that showed that real chemistry between the characters could be grasped the bdsm montage where beyonces sloweddown version of crazy in love plays is actually kind of awesome not because of the sex scene taking place but because fucking beyonce is being sexed up even more than she usually is the beat is ridiculously cool secondly this television presenter obviously hasnt seen many bad movies if she could call this worse than the room troll 2 or showgirls films which i love but understand are terrible in every way shape or form i think the main reason why people are just calling this terrible is because of bdsm scares me or it counts as abuse so i should therefore rate the film low this same issue in terms of morality not bdsm occurred with 2013s the wolf of wall street many wrongfully thought the film was saying okay to the kind of life that jordan belfort lives throughout much of its duration when in fact it was just a reflection on his mistakes and shows him getting the comeuppance he deserves for his dastardly acts numerous times within the film is not saying that you should all go out and try bdsm maybe thats what the author was saying but i dont believe that was the intention of director sam taylorjohnson and perhaps people can be slightly more openminded just because youre not into something in terms of a sexual fetish doesnt necessarily mean you need to degrade a film for expploring that same fetish because that is personal preference and you should not be rating a films subject matter but how it executes it if i made a movie about a murderous gangster and you dont like murderous gangsters but you still thought the film was technically proficient and perfect in its narrative would you rate it negatively fuck off of course you wouldnt    wow i wrote a lot more than i intended all the same this movie gets a perfect rating for its technical achievements but gets nothing for its story dialogue and performances dakota johnson is forced to suffer this fate due to her lack of chemistry with her male lead which is fairly important when they spend 95 of the movie in the same room though in honesty this is namely dornans fault its literally in the middle of the road the sex scenes arent sexy the main lead isnt that sexy the screenplay is cringeworthy terrible and stupid just go and watch secretary for a component story that features both bdsm and a character called mr grey youll feel better about it when all is said and done anyway
Feb 15 2015,positive,better than i expected dakota johnson was a great fit and jamie dornan grew on me when i first seen him i wasnt sure he would be able to pull it off but by the end i was a believer the sex scenes were done in good taste i hated the ending but honestly its because i didnt want it to end followed the book pretty good cant wait for part 2  want it to end i knew ow it was just following the book
Feb 15 2015,positive,i was not expecting much from this movie as there is no real plot in the first book at all while the lack of plot was still evident in the movie i still felt every moment ana and christian shared together whether hot moments or not and i believe the actors were great choices for the role i really liked anas innocence and obvious shock at some of the scenes where christian randomly appears or says something a little out of the ordinary i am looking forward to the next movie which hopefully brings a little more story
Feb 15 2015,negative,this was disgusting  perpetuated sexism not to mention tried to romanticize abusive relationships  completely misrepresented bdsm relationships this movie is shocking  its not even because of the sex which i will say was the least offensive part i hate movies like these and i always will and i can only hope the media stops projecting these horrible stereotypes  misinformation  romantic pictures of actually really traumatic situations
Feb 15 2015,negative,total crap  you can find better stuff on the internet with more heart and passion  and that would be watching any puppy thing on facebook  the only reason to go is if you are a single guy looking to get lucky cause the audience is mostly women  the leading man stinks horrible casting for his part  dont waste your money or time  go and buy some sexy toys and create your own fun
Feb 15 2015,negative,1 in your mind draw a line between bad and bad enough to be good  2 mark it with numbers one to six  3 throw a dice  4 place the movie on that line accordingly     and when you are actually watching this booze helps and more the better     just remember before the screening to reload the battery of your iphone so you can check your messages during the sex scenes or watch some free porn because those scenes are the moments when you really start to wonder which would be the quickest and easiest way to kill yourself
Feb 15 2015,positive,if i wanted to see porn i could of watched it for free on the internet waiting to see if there will be a part two but with less sex
Feb 15 2015,positive,so hot and sexy what a crazy twisted life for a not normal relationship
Feb 15 2015,negative,pretty much watching a porn in a public theater with the same acting quality that you would see in an adult film     010 would not watch again
Feb 15 2015,positive,i personally think for the way movies based off books go this was one of the better ones especially considering the amount of adult content that needed to be worked with
Feb 15 2015,negative,this movie sucked i went to see it and expected to more than this boring sappy love story that starts out really slow and that is all i can say because i fell asleep in the movie theater about 45 minutes into the movie a guy next to me woke me up to tell me the movie was over he also agreed with me that the movie was boring and outside of a few sex scenes was not very good at all i expected more 50 shades of grey but was truthfully disappointed
Feb 15 2015,positive,it was much better than i thought it was going to be and the romance story was enjoyable im glad that everything was done tastefully and not raunchy at all 45
Feb 15 2015,positive,exceeded my expectations stayed right on with the book before seeing the movie i did not think if like who they castes for anastasia and christian but they are exceptional actors i want to see it again and again
Feb 15 2015,negative,the movie is so bad that it kinda bored me at times to bland ive seen more movies with more sexual context on skinnamax
Feb 14 2015,negative,fifty shades of grey must refer to how poorly lit this film was they had nothing i think many people even women who are fans of the book will be disappointed in this highly derivative and poorly acted film thats all hype and no substance the supposedly provocative sex scenes arent tastefully lit just dark and much like soft porn on showtime its mostly elbows and armpits and a lot of unnecessary heavy breathing someone is going to make a fortune on a film that is utterly forgettable there is a reason several big name actors turned down this movie and once you see it youll know why go rent 9 12 weeks or the secretary to see this genre done correctly there is no doubt the author of the book and the director have both seen these films fifty shades of meehhh is more like it d for disappointing and dull
Feb 14 2015,negative,watching paint dry is more exciting and interesting than this movie i did like the soundtrack though
Feb 14 2015,positive,jamie did an amazing christian grey as did dakota with ana the movie stayed pretty close to the books in a sense the sex scenes are not as scandalous as some people have said and theyre actually pretty brief unless youre ultra conservative those scenes wont freak you out ive seen more explicit scenes on some very famous cable shows like masters of sex i really enjoyed the movie but i felt it was rushed because so many details were omitted at times it felt like it jumped from scene to scene without anything tying them together i understood where they were going with each scene but only because ive read the books i think they missed the mark by eliminating details and conversations between christian and ana that appear in the book that humanize christian and make him more lovable hes quite playful in the books and you can feel his love for ana growing as the story goes on thats not as clear in the movie it ended as it should as it ends in the book mostly but even the ending lacked depth which it has in the books what leads to the last scene in the red room what follows anas words for christian and his to her are cut short in the movie which made it seem a bit cold theres a lot more emotion in the book those of us that know the books well 100 million or so would have gladly sat through 20 more minutes of the movie to have those added details in there if youve never read the books or just hated the movie because it had too much sex you didnt like the story or whatever theres no changing your mind good thing this movie wasnt made for you and its going to make loads of money despite your negative criticism which means fifty shades darker and freed are coming ha
Feb 14 2015,negative,boring the movie is about sex bdsm it seemed like the creators only wanted to dwell upon that but unfortunately had to create some background story because you dont get directly to sex you get porno if you do so all the plot is extremely weak and its only purpose is to provide the terms for sex characters behave unrealisticaly they do unreasonable and random stuff they get horny by looking and each other lips etc   you might think well i bet at least the sex scenes themselves are cool no they are not they are neither appealing nor horryfying nor passionate they are lame and boring the deep breathing fist clenching shouting etc seem out of place for there is no real cause for them   and it gets more and more random during one of the final scenes which were supposed to be extremely dramatic and make viewers cry the entire cinema hall started to clap and burst into laughs because what was happenning on the screen was random illogical and simply stupid
Feb 14 2015,positive,they followed the book for the most part and that made the movie christian grey and anastasias chemistry was undeniable if you keep an open mind and dont expect too much or too little then you will enjoy it more  overall pretty good
Feb 14 2015,positive,never read this book stars based on movie alone ending a bit of a shock
Feb 14 2015,negative,not very pleased with the movie at all the books were much better the movie felt very long and boring another couple went with my husband and i and both men fell asleep
Feb 14 2015,positive,compared to the book it was fairly true ask through out actors were decent except for the guy who plays grey but that a hard character to come alive anyway so im letting it slide a bit over all i was actually somewhat more pleased at how it came out     remember its a very expect novel so bringing it to the big screen its going to be down played a lot and short in most scenes
Feb 14 2015,positive,5 out of 5 stars would not recommend soundtrack is amazing tho
Feb 14 2015,negative,go watch the kingsman instead
Feb 14 2015,positive,great movie cant wait to see the next one
Feb 14 2015,negative,most god awful movie ever
Feb 14 2015,negative,this movie was extremely slow moving and had the worst possible ending
Feb 14 2015,positive,i liked it it was sexual and hot im sure the book is much better but overall it was pretty good
Feb 14 2015,positive,turning a soft core porn novel into a blockbuster film was no easy task turning every womans fantastical vision of christian grey into reality was virtually impossibly but taylorjohnson turned a mediocrely yet incredibly engaging novel into exactly what the shades reader needed fifty shades reminded every woman why she woke her husband up in the middle of the night for spontaneous booty why she desired for her arms to be pinned over her head why she fell in love in the first place the film satisfied every image in my head and without being a lifetime movie or cinemax late night special fifty shades did exactly what needed to be done    jamie dornan has been criticized for his stiff portrayal of grey however his stiffly covered accent contrasted perfectly with his playful and passionate moments physically no man could live up to the expectations in which james wrote grey but dornans dark squint while showing his disdain for ana leaving for georgia his pouty lips while smiling as she negotiates the contract from across the table and his body while slowly mounting her naked body in the red room of pain allowed for a slow love to grow for this character     most amazing though was dakota johnson as ana steele as i read the narrator in the novel i only pictured kristen stewarts whiny persona and i hated every aspect of the character in no way did i read her as deserving of christian but johnson made her beautiful close ups excite the viewer and her acting was humorous sexy and believable as a college student i understood exactly why grey loved her     as a movie viewer who rarely sees romantic films i was pleased as i left the theatre and am ready for the sequel
Feb 14 2015,positive,definitely not a movie for men but definitely a yes for ladies enough said
Feb 14 2015,positive,i loved this movie can not see what the problem is i did go in with low expectations and i was happily surprised
Feb 14 2015,negative,beautifully shot film but good lord that was bad absolutely no chemistry between the actors over the top cheesy dialogue and yes they show some of the raunchy bdsm stuff but at a minimum also ends at a random spot and youre like what thats it ok seriously go see it if you want but save your money not worth it
Feb 14 2015,positive,unbelievably true but my hubby really enjoyed watching this movie maybe it was due to anastasia being naked but at least he didnt fall asleep we totally loved it 
Feb 14 2015,positive,actually wasnt that bad  i expected far worse
Feb 14 2015,negative,jd fell flat  and the script was awful stick to the books
Feb 14 2015,negative,completetrainwreck what happens when you mix a bad twilight fanfiction complete with awful writing a misinformed and uneducated portrayal of the bdsm society and abuse wrapped in a garbage bag you get this poor excuse for a movie
Feb 14 2015,positive,excellent screenlplay and acting  followed  like  the book much better  than i expected would recommend to all age grou9s over 21
Feb 14 2015,positive,to give an accurate rating of this movie one must have read the book having said that i feel that dekota and jamie did well portraying their characters  the book was never intended to make a female sexual statement positive or negative its from the perspective of a young naive virgin who meets this man who then take her on the ride of life thats it
Feb 14 2015,negative,one of the most boring movies ive ever had the displeasure of catching in the theater its the same dull story looped about 5 times over the movie feels 5 hours long the soft core porn will get some of the faithful readers hot and bothered but as a movie goes this was so boring total waste of time
Feb 14 2015,positive,great movie happy valentines day to me
Feb 14 2015,positive,anyone who read the first book had to know what to expect  trying to film a movie based on a lengthy novel is impossible  for the most part i thought they pretty well stuck to the book the movie was exactly what i expected i loved it and look forward to see the last two films of the trilogy my only complaint is i did not like the male lead he was not at all what i expected christian grey to look like on the other hand dakota was perfect for the role
Feb 14 2015,negative,if you want to have any understanding of whats happening in this movie definitely read the book the screen play adaption is terrible youve had to read the book to understand every conversation and scene transitionkeeping in mind that the books are terribly edited highly suggest to wait for this to drop on dvd
Feb 14 2015,negative,this movie was painful to watch the movie was badly made with bad acting and no chemistry between the costars  dakota johnson did ok jamie dornan not so much  i knew the reviews were bad and so i did not expect much going into it but was still astonished  the movie bombed  such a shame cause it had great potential  dont waste your time or money
Feb 14 2015,positive,i really enjoyed not knowing anything about what to expect in this movie it kept my attention somehow the only reason why i didnt give it a 55 is because half of the movie involved seeing dakotas a cup boobs
Feb 14 2015,negative,while refreshing to see a movie where the main subject isnt revenge vigilanteism save the damsel in distress or any other of the traditional blockbuster movie tropes  that alone doesnt make this well good this movie presents closeup shot after closeup shot of tacky dialogue and self loathing
Feb 14 2015,positive,two words for this moviepanty dropperlove love love it def a must c
Feb 14 2015,negative,horrible not worth it i took 2 naps the build up took to long and it wasnt worth the hype
Feb 14 2015,negative,the acting is fine everything seems pretty fine but the story the action its all so boring i felt like the guy who is listening to someone tell a story they feel is really crazy and at the end you look at them and are like seriously not much to get here other then boredom
Feb 14 2015,negative,seriously disappointing it was t  like they didnt finish the story just stopped in the middle of no where totally bad waited two years to see how a womans love can change a man and they left out all the good parts that make it a great story
Feb 14 2015,negative,horrible movie waste of money the trailer showed the best parts of the film
Feb 14 2015,negative,wife attended long time fan said it translated from book to screen very badly her  the audience were laughing when they shouldnt have been
Feb 14 2015,positive,i read the book and didnt expect a whole lot from the movie with that being said i loved the movie it followed the book pretty well in my opinion of course certain scenes didnt make it to the big screen but it is understandable definitely leaves you wanting more and i am glad the movie didnt try to put all the books into one movie
Feb 14 2015,negative,fifty shades of boredom
Feb 14 2015,negative,dakota johnson gives a rather great performance and the film looks like it was made with attention but this fifty shades of grey adaptation spends two hours pursuing almost nothing or with no depth
Feb 14 2015,negative,awful acting poor directing one star for the sound track
Feb 14 2015,positive,i really liked the movie  i have read the books and i think everyone should read them before they see the movie or not soon after  its not just about sex there is a lot more going on
Feb 14 2015,positive,never read the books but i was interested through the whole movie will watch the others when they come out
Feb 14 2015,positive,i havent read the book but i know they skipped important parts of the book at the beginning i thought i was watching twilights 1st movie i really need to read the books to understand better
Feb 14 2015,positive,much better than expected not sure why the critics are being so unfavorable
Feb 14 2015,positive,was okay however they seemed to focus more on the visual of the movie than the actual story line they dont hone in on just how intense the storyline or mr grey truly are   would give 7 out of 10
Feb 14 2015,positive,i think its funny all of the negative reviews are from men the sex scenes are quite enticing and it is well balanced with the story in the first book the book is always better than the movie its that way with every book series that has been put to film but i am pleased with this movie the way it leaves you hanging is awful awful as in tortureeveryone in the theater screamed no when the credits started rolling my friends and i cant wait for 2
Feb 14 2015,negative,the movie is ok i was not expecting a oscar movie but i think it was made for people who havent read the books there are better sex scenes on hbostarz and showtime they take off the crazy of grey
Feb 14 2015,positive,refreshing break from all the superhero crashem smashem movies it is a nearly perfect adaptation of the novel by el james keeping it within the realm of a movie and not a porno
Feb 14 2015,positive,better than the boring book
Feb 14 2015,negative,i just dont get it i have to admit it was well shot but for me thats all i enjoyed dakota johnson was ok but with all the fucking lip biting it and supposed lusty stares it just made me laugh ham acted and overlong tripe that calls itself a romantic drama not to mention the piss weak bdsm unintentionally hilarious and dumb
Feb 14 2015,negative,it isnt the worst film ive ever seen but it isnt very good
Feb 14 2015,positive,if you didnt read the books you will never understand the movie
Feb 14 2015,negative,trash very well directed well acted badly written trash fifty shades of grey is exactly what this movie shouldnt have been boring letter grade c
Feb 14 2015,positive,i think they did a great job with all the cast except for christian  i have read the books and was greatly disappointed  i think i actually feel asleep a few times
Feb 14 2015,positive,my review for 50 shades of grey 55 stars  absolutely brilliant im so glad that i didnt let those uptight people who were distorting the facts of the storyline to make it out to be a movie about abuse to women brainwash me it is not about violence to women both in the book and movie there is consent between anastasia and christian at all times there is no form of abuse  the movie followed the books storyline really well and the actors had great chemistry this is a love story not a story of abuse
Feb 14 2015,positive,went 2 see movie i loved it
Feb 14 2015,negative,50 shades is not worth it if you have read the book you will be very pissed off about how much they left out if you havent read it you will be confused over all one of the worst movies i have seen in a long time
Feb 14 2015,positive,basic instinct was better
Feb 14 2015,negative,boring love story with some weird creepy love scenes mixed in
Feb 14 2015,positive,amazing movie i was hesitant because of the reviews but then i realized that people were giving this movie a bad review long before it ever came out i think some people just really do not want this movie to do well jealousy and what not anywhoo i decided not to listen and was pleasantly surprised it is funny and sweet sexy and intense all at the same time i will be seeing it again
Feb 14 2015,negative,horrible   any abuse on women i just cant enjoy
Feb 14 2015,negative,tripe basically a movie about abuse dressed up like bdsm with hollow characters corny lines and lackluster story there are other more romantic and sexy movies out there
Feb 14 2015,positive,i liked the movie i thought the way it was filmed was great the screenwriting lacked although i did enjoy the funny bits here and there dakota j did a wonderful jobjamie dornan is an amazing actor but in this film it did not show through i think because they make him so closed off it almost seemed awkward it also seemed rushed certain scenes seemed like they came and went way faster than in the book  i understand you cant make ever scene exactly like the book but yeah it was just rushed im hoping in the next film adaptations when christian starts to open up more that it wont seem as awkward other than that i enjoyed the movie
Feb 14 2015,negative,not only does this book feature an emotionally immature young woman masquerading as an intelligent adult it romanticizes abuse and includes a rape scene which is never acknowledged as one do not support this blatant endorsement of abusive relationships
Feb 14 2015,positive,this movie is the first of three in my opinion the bad reviews are from people judging this back in itself rather than a three part story i enjoyed the characters and the story just relax and enjoy the sexy scenes and modern music
Feb 14 2015,positive,although i blame the painful pun intended dialogue and at times sluggish narrative on the overly silly source material this borderline parody oozes so much melodrama that its difficult not to succumb to what really is an incredibly entertaining albeit flawed film
Feb 14 2015,positive,it was a great movie dont be afraid of what these prude  people are saying if you can open your mind outside the vanilla and understand what bdsm is then you like me will love the movie there was absolutely no rape in this movie and for people to say that it was happening it preposterous
Feb 14 2015,negative,it was a horrible movie there was no plot and then the acting was the worst it is not worth the time or money
Feb 14 2015,negative,terrible idea and concept that even if could happen would really suck
Feb 14 2015,neutral,a chic flick for sure mind manipulation perversion etc most woman will hate this guy some will be turned on by him
Feb 14 2015,positive,loved watching 50 shades of grey and cant wait for part 2
Feb 14 2015,positive,just saw this and i have to say for reading the books they did a very good job with the movie it was very well done
Feb 14 2015,neutral,movie was good with comparison to the book however the cast in the movie was absolutely horrible johnson was honestly the only actress that fit her roll sad to say i was rather disappointed
Feb 14 2015,negative,the worst 40 bucks i every spend  f the part 2
Feb 14 2015,positive,very enjoyable despite the negative critic reviews its slow moving yet keeps you interested thought it was cast well and the actors did a very good job glad they stayed true to the book the soundtrack is wonderful too
Feb 14 2015,negative,it was faithful to the book which was awful dakota johnson did as much as she could with the role james dornan looked bored and like he did it for the money no wonder why charlie hunnam backed out please dont make a sequel
Feb 14 2015,negative,i could not wait to see this movie seen it  was not happy at all the movie was dumb it was definitely a porno and it was a waste of money 
Feb 14 2015,negative,vaguely interesting to say the least
Feb 14 2015,positive,not because its a good film obvs
Feb 14 2015,positive,i really thought the movie played out well and it was a lot like the book i think it was tastefully done considering the books content i cant wait for the next one
Feb 14 2015,positive,i did not expect to like the movie and dakota but i did good ending
Feb 14 2015,positive,i enjoyed the book and liked the movie  funny erotic and well done
Feb 14 2015,positive,loved it n now im going to read the books
Feb 14 2015,positive,better than i expected
Feb 14 2015,negative,horrible unbelievable crapunbelievable crapno story line i dont know how desperate dakota was to agree to a movie like this not a movie to waste you hard earned money on i am a movie junkie but still this was too bada torture for close to 2 hours will have to see kingsman tomorrow to get back to normal
Feb 14 2015,negative,not as you would take it  would have wished it kept your attention for longer not graphic just a regular rated r film nothing more disliked
Feb 14 2015,positive,i freaking loved it i cant wait for the next one to come out
Feb 14 2015,negative,as far as worldwide phenomenons go fifty shades has to be one of the most perplexing that i can remember i havent read the books but lets just say ive seen enough to get a feel for their overall tone so with the film come the legions of expectant fans which means cinemas can somehow justify putting on 30 screenings of the film in one day i have to say its nice to see a cinema so busy but why cant people get this excited over something like whiplash which is a genuinely phenomenal film i assume that question will go unanswered    fifty shades of grey suffers from the same problem as a number of erotic films in recent years there really isnt much to it drab affairs such as 9 songs sleeping beauty and the canyons appeared content to fall back on the use of explicit scenes as a selling point but they all forgot to convey any real drama or characters in their film this is true of fifty shades which with the best will in the world is far from enthralling the two lead actors share a chemistry which is thin anyway but it is remarkable that some of the dialogue made the cut perhaps that is more of a problem with the source material than the filmmakers but it makes for an unintentionally laughable experience at various points     then there is the sexual content over the last year and a half we have seen blue is the warmest colour stranger by the lake and nymphomaniac each compelling in their own way but importantly they each pushed the boundaries of what we expect and what can be permissible in an 18 certificate film fifty shades of grey is not only tame compared to these films it is tame even going back as far as something like in the realm of the senses 1976 it feels like a watered down version of a book which may well have been unfilmable outside of the r18 certification id imagine given the mpaas wariness of sexuality on screen that this had more to do with avoiding the nc17 certificate over in america    expectations were low and they were not exceeded fifty shades is a laboured film constructed to titillate the box office but little else
Feb 14 2015,positive,love that they stayed true to the book dakota portrayed anastasias innocence and strength
Feb 14 2015,negative,i liked his cars and closet
Feb 14 2015,positive,this movie was handled so well the falling in love part was really evident her reluctance to become involved the actors did great and the sex scenes werent drawn out to make you uncomfortable
Feb 14 2015,negative,this adaptation doesnt even begin to elicit the same emotional response or entice the audience in the slightest jamie dornan is a dud his character portrays a mindless sex machine but hes really intended to have more of a personality than that not to mention hes just not that goodlooking dakota johnson filled the role way better than dornan although she has way more personality in the book i also wish that we wouldve been able to get more insight on the characters i feel like we never really got to know anybodyit was just one big blur that jumped too quickly from scene to scene it took away from the suspense and tension the story is intended to have overall disappointed and annoyed that i had to cover my eyes every time i saw anas bush
Feb 14 2015,positive,this movies alright its mostly just a guy trying to turn a girl into his sex slave her tits were too small in this movie
Feb 14 2015,positive,followed the book pretty close
Feb 14 2015,positive,going into this movie all i knew about it was the sex aspect of it personally i really enjoyed it i really liked the characters and there weird twisted relationship something about it just stuck
Feb 14 2015,positive,it thought it was a great movie
Feb 14 2015,positive,okay so i thought this would be a soso movie and i was not far off  but i was totally unprepared for dakota johnsons performancewhat a diamond in a pile of hay she is in this film  genuine intriguing and makes me believe a billionaire might sign his life secrets over to her  what a ninja piece of acting that was
Feb 14 2015,neutral,wasnt hoping for a great movie to start with also kinda had the twilight vibe at one point but anyways had a blast laughed a lot because of the poor acting job of m grey
Feb 14 2015,negative,barely a plot to it christian grey is a psycho
Feb 14 2015,negative,this is the worst movie i have ever seen what a waste of time and money
Feb 14 2015,positive,this movie portrayed the book extremely well it was intense and you saw how anastasia was changing christian their attraction was well shown based on the book
Feb 14 2015,negative,one of the worst movies i have ever seen poor acting poor dialogue and low budget sets it was so bad i didnt know what lets to laugh at so i ended up laughing at everything
Feb 14 2015,negative,boring if ever a movie needed a werewolf this was the one
Feb 14 2015,positive,i absolutely loved it while i dont think this was the best choice of actors the movie was well represented
Feb 14 2015,negative,hate it read a chapter from the book horrible piece of literature encourages rape culture and violent activity disguised as sex boycott50shades
Feb 14 2015,neutral,just skip it and watch a good movie this could have been very good instead it was very bad   the most entertaining part of this movie was the fat older women getting all excited while watching the grey unfold guys if you want a women go wait outside this movie and you will find one and they will be ready well they might be if you look like christian   good luck if you go see this movie and do not have the entertaining crowd that i did because you will most likely be bored and wondering if someone can whip you to get you awake
Feb 14 2015,positive,for those who read the books you are going to like the movie those who didnt wont simple as that
Feb 14 2015,negative,the movie got half a star from me and that only cause its the lowest rating i can give it if it was possible to give it a atom of a star i would thats how stupid retarded lame pathetic and sad this movie is i have no idea why people even want to see this movie i went just cause my wife wanted to see it and even she agrees with me horrible and depressing honestly to this day i have never in my life seen such a crappy movie and that includes all the musicals and black and white movies i have seen or been forced to watch
Feb 14 2015,negative,wouldnt waste your time or money on this film  dornan mediocre acting maybe movie would have been better with a better actor  johnsons acting was great but dont know why she would have agreed to accept a porn role
Feb 14 2015,positive,actually not bad  i do however have a high tolerance for movies
Feb 14 2015,positive,if you read the books and liked the story line you will enjoy the movie if you havent a clue what the storyline is about and you believe all the media sex hype then you will be disappointed i liked it
Feb 14 2015,positive,i think they did a great job with the movie  not as detailed as the book of course but i still enjoyed it
Feb 14 2015,positive,slow start but pretty hot enjoyed
Feb 14 2015,positive,absolutely loved it if you read the books then you will be pleased with the movie it kept the key points and had humor and romance where it was needed all the scenes were believable and dakota was stunning so much can be said with a look also if you have not you should listen to the soundtrack
Feb 14 2015,negative,more like fifty shades of shit
Feb 14 2015,positive,this movie is about a guy that was abused as a child then sexually abused as a teenager  studies show that victims will often repeat the abuse  i think if you look deeper youll see ana trying to rescue christian  yeah there is sex but the is a lot more going on then just the sex
Feb 14 2015,positive,it really stayed true to the book i loved it
Feb 14 2015,positive,even with the negative reviews i still loved it
Feb 14 2015,positive,an okay movie not anywhere near as good as the book it was a little too choppy and didnt quite have the smooth flow of the book also dakota johnsons acting wasnt always great and she didnt give anastasia enough sass as she has in the book the development of their relationship was lacking they seemed like they sacrificed a lot in attempts to make the movie shorter there were other things they could have cut down on that would have benefited the movie better  there needed to be better scene transitions and conclusions
Feb 14 2015,positive,started out good then seemed to drag  on  we left early
Feb 14 2015,neutral,most of the reviewers who gave this film a low score are probably missing the point and most appear to be men so thats no surprise yes the dialog is cheesy and unrealistic but who the hell went to see this because of the dialog the movie like the book is all about passion buildup and release  specifically for women i saw this movie on valentines day thinking it would if anything prove to be a great gift to my wife instead i was treated to a funny and intense drama taking place in a fantasy version of reality where an innocent virgin girl is thrown into a sexual world far deeper than she could have ever imagined rather than simply be an object to the brooding mr grey she struggles to balance her desire to be with him with her knowledge that somethings clearly wrong with him and it was fun to see her talk back to him from time to time and challenge him    there was nothing special about the writing acting directing or cinematography to earn this movie a prestigious review from most critics but it is successful in accomplishing what it sets out to do and i think the world would be a better place if more movies and other forms of mass media were willing to deal with sexuality more often    also the soundtrack was pretty damn slick    read my full thoughts on my blog at 
Feb 14 2015,negative,cant see what all the hype was about and how was this an 18 rating it wasnt very steamy not much more to say its a film written by directed by and loved by women my girlfriend liked it blokes will be scratching their heads about it it reminds me of twilight how besotted the male lead was with the female for no apparent reason it was pretty dull and i didnt really care for the characters not a film i would recommend
Feb 14 2015,negative,fifty shades of shite
Feb 14 2015,positive,if you liked the books youll like the movie i thought it was fantastic
Feb 14 2015,negative,i was so bored with this movie that i walked out at the end with a really bad headache from trying to keep myself awake through it bad acting bad storyline way too overhyped
Feb 14 2015,negative,was so excited to see this movie until i actually saw this movie jamie dornan did a piss poor job capturing the essence of christian grey he was lame at best i gave the movie one star based on the fact it kept true to the plot and the music was outstanding ive seen enough of dakota johnson to last me a lifetime literally
Feb 14 2015,negative,sm through the lens of mary whitehouse drivel
Feb 14 2015,negative,glorified and well produced porn misogyny  never sounded so good
Feb 14 2015,negative,50 shades of horrible
Feb 14 2015,negative,saw it and total let down this movie was suppose to be the breakouta sexual revolution it wasnt the sm more like mms what the fuck it didnt leave me hot and bothered everything about it was awful only bright spot dakota johnson she sold me but it just made me hate her also why did she keep going back to christian the sex scenes what a tease its like they have sex and then it cuts halfway through to a postcoital scene it never shows them having an orgasm like wtf he did not sell me on the dominatrixhot ceo he was so weak because of that i did not believe in their chemistry it wasnt there they need a better step up for the sequels and yes i did read the books and im a woman the hype didnt live up to the expectations
Feb 14 2015,positive,it goes along with book 1 its entertaining its not overly graphic we really enjoyed it
Feb 14 2015,positive,i personally liked it they kept it like the book i wouldve picked different actors at least a different christian but together they had good chemistry for such a very awkward scenes they had to do lots of ta
Feb 14 2015,negative,you going to get sleepy watching this movie
Feb 14 2015,negative,so here is my two cents for anyone who wants it  i am a reader i read books like no ones business and 9 times out of 10 the book is so much better than the movie so naturally when i saw how amazingly popular this trilogy was i had to jump into the hype  three long redundant books later i came to the conclusion that while the books had a decent story line they were not well written im pretty sure i could never hear oh my or anything about an internal goddess again without shuddering   then the movie came out promising to focus more on the story itself than the countless sex scenes i was thrilled and intrigued the suspense for the movie built for about a year and i attended a showing today with hope that it would be everything i had ever imagined for one of my favorite couples  lol  first the awkward and uncomfortable tension between the two main stars of the movie is enough to send you back to your middle school years completely cringe worthy the opening scenes while nice were not necessary to the plot of the movie at all i knew that the hollywood version of the story would probably have some additions and a few  scenes left out i felt completely shocked when some of the more romantic not sex scenes were completely cut out of existence leaving me with a story about a cold egotistical sadist who wants to control a poor innocent college graduate while there were times when i was drawn in most scenes were ended about as quickly as they began  dont even get me started on the sex scenes of which there were plenty while the book keeps all the scenes quite awfully repetitive the movie changed it a tad but again the awkwardness between the two main characters in more scenes than others was dreadfully distracting   all in all the first thirty minutes or so stuck to the book well enough to at least keep me entertained if you didnt read the book series maybe you can enjoy the plot line as done by the movie if you did read and mostly enjoy the book series dont even waste your money christian and ana are probably better in writing than on the big screen
Feb 14 2015,negative,dakota johnson almost saves 50 shades of grey with a star making performance alas the movie is tame dull and scared and johnsons co star jamie dornan is out shined by his better co star a major plot hole would stop this timid movie in 30 minutes johnson spins her cheesy lines into gold while dornan cant do the same this movie is too afraid to tackle its real problem christian greys low self esteem issues
Feb 14 2015,positive,20 minutes of raunchy sex and 40 minutes of dakota johnson biting her lip and looking sexysad  2 hours of valentine day happiness for the ladies 
Feb 14 2015,positive,i will agree that the book was much better than the movie i always thought that it would be hard to translate onto the big screen as most of the book is from anas head
Feb 14 2015,negative,dont go to watch this movie if you dont want to waste your time
Feb 14 2015,positive,i liked that it did follow the book but i can see where some may think the sex scenes needed to be more intense i did think that dakota did fit as anastasia but her wardrobe choice was not ideal i felt she needed to dress a little more sexier for the role i also did find that jamie held back at times where he needed to be more aggresive
Feb 14 2015,negative,if you read the books you may enjoy it maybe if you have not dont waste your money there was minimal chemistry between the leads and sex scenes were so awkward that i thought i was in high school all over again minus the bondage disappointing sums it up
Feb 14 2015,negative,very choppy and leaves a lot of good info out jamie isnt the best christian maybe hell be better in darker
Feb 14 2015,negative,50 shades of gormless
Feb 14 2015,positive,i did not really care for the books but i thought the movie was funny  mom and jill and i liked it
Feb 14 2015,positive,going into the cinema to see fifty shades of grey i have to admit i was excited after seeing so much hype surrounding it and the reaction from the fans at the new york fan screening i couldnt wait to see if this would be one of the films of the year and i have to say i think it definitely will be     adapted from one of the biggest selling books of all time by el james sam taylorjohnson introduces us to the world of fifty shades of grey in a romantic sexual manner that has a hidden comedic side which makes it appealing for all this valentines day     the film follows anastasia steele a young english literature student who falls for the charms of mr christian grey after interviewing him for her friend however with his good looks and brooding charms ana soon learns that he has a dominating side which he wants to explore with her in his red room embarking on a bdsm relationship the pair have many sexy moments together that are tested right up until the end     from the moment it started right up until the end the film follows the plot of the book almost completely the same which made me very happy as someone who had read them while i did find some of the book quotes to be used too much there was a need for certain ones to fit certain scenes and i can see why they had to be used     as for the steamy moments they are wellvery steamy while some critics said they were a bit tame they certainly are not there is a lot of action on screen and in my cinema we found ourselves laughing not because they were bad but at the realisation that we were watching such hot moments together the cast and crew have made tasteful sexual scenes that give off a lot of heat and will not disappoint fans of the book who are going to see how they have made the move from the pages of the book you may have an image in your head of the red room but forget it because it is completely not what you expect     people who havent read the book will be surprised by a lot of elements of the film as was the person who i went with was but they will be able to see the different ways in which the characters feel at times and how their power or presence is meant to come across it starts with a very innocent ana however by the end of the film the power is back in her court and that is due to the excellent casting choices     while some people have been worried about the way in which ana would be presented of screen i think that dakota johnson was an amazing choice not knowing much about her acting style beforehand after only catching her in the social network and ben and kate i wasnt sure if she would fit the role however she proved me wrong and i am now a huge fan of hers her acting talents are so perfect for this role and she gives ana life in the film that people will be happy to see     and as for jamie dornan he is mr christian grey he manages to get the brooding character just right and when you see him break down the walls of mr grey you can see his acting abilities shine through the casting of him was incredible and his whole likeness to the character is great anyone who doubted him will be changing the way they feel by the end of this film for sure and will be a dornan fan straight away     the other supporting characters all have a certain charm about them and make the characters come to life for me the most impressive performances came from eloise mumford who plays anas flatmate kate who is so much more likable in the films then the book i wasnt her biggest fan when i read them but by the end of this film i supported her a lot and joining her was luke grimes who plays christians brother elliot who gave the film a fun character and marcia gay harden who is the perfect mother figure each one has something about them that brings the whole film together and makes a tight knit group of stars that bounce off each others abilities     for me however the true star of the film was the director sam taylorjohnson has done an incredible job at keeping the film true to the book and while i have heard there is something that she wanted to change but couldnt i think she has done a very good job fans that are looking to see their favourite moments on screen will and the world of these characters has been captured in an immense world that will draw in the audience from start to finish     she has also provided an amazing soundtrack to the film starting with annie lennoxs amazing voice singing i put a spell on you to the wellknown beyoncé songs each has its place and each one fits it i always notice the soundtrack to a film and while i had heard a few pieces from this films one beforehand it was so much better hearing them on the big screen especially the vaults song     the only thing i felt was a bit troubling was the ending however as someone who had read the book i knew it was coming i was just a little shocked at the way in which it ended so suddenly but the more i think of it i am happy it did end there instead of dragging out a moment that didnt need to happen although it would have been nice to have seen the toy plane scene in this film because i think that is an element from the book that sticks with the fans a lot of the time     overall i found the film to be an enjoyable valentines day treat and while it does have some small faults it will draw you in and make you smile at moments or feel a little upset for the characters each actor knew what they were doing and i think that this film will do amazing things for johnsons career in the future because she has given the performance of a lifetime in this role and people will be able to see it from the mood of each scene to the perfectly placed songs there is nothing this film is really lacking so i would definitely go and have a watch as soon as possible lovelies because i dont seem this franchise going anywhere soon
Feb 14 2015,positive,the movie sticks real close to the book the only thing is it seemed a little rushed dakota and jamie were perfect choices for christian and anastasia
Feb 14 2015,positive,it was real written and acted
Feb 14 2015,negative,fifty shades of boring  poor dakota johnson she was the best part of this movie and she tried jamie dorman is a blank slate and not invested at all we laughed when we shouldnt and got to the end and said  wtf
Feb 14 2015,positive,good book to movie adaptation
Feb 14 2015,negative,couldnt wait for it to be over these were my ex wifes words before during and after our relationship i repeated these words about 5 minutes into the movie the previews were far more entertaining then the feature presentation an informercial for nutribullet is more exciting which i want one of those things and just when i thought the agony was over there was another hour to go complete waste of life id rather catch ebola then watch this movie
Feb 14 2015,positive,great movie stays true to the books i highly commend sam taylor johnson in capturing the essence of christian and anastasias love story as well as jamie dornan and dakota johnson for portraying their characters perfectly bravo for making anastasia steele the confident woman in power of the relationship the haters can suck it
Feb 14 2015,positive,i loved it  i thought it was funny sexy and romantic  i wasnt too sure about the leads at first but they pulled it off and worked well together  jamie was hot i cant wait for the next one
Feb 14 2015,negative,it sucked   horrible movie  dont even waste your timemoney
Feb 14 2015,negative,horrendous acting and worse story give this poor excuse of a film a pass
Feb 14 2015,positive,solid 4 stars good entertainment value good soundtrack
Feb 14 2015,positive,i saw it with my husband who did not read the books i was completely impressed with dakota johnson she was completely adorable and just as head strong as anna is in the books there was more than enough sex scenes that was balanced well with the first books story line she is completely in control of the relationship and starts the beginning of christians rehabilitation the ending definitely leaves you wanting more looking forward to the next two movies
Feb 14 2015,positive,honestly wasnt sure i was going to like this movie but i absolutely  love it
Feb 14 2015,positive,i loved this movie i cant wait for the next one to come out if you enjoyed reading the books then you will enjoy watching the movie for sure
Feb 14 2015,negative,if i could give this a negative rating i would this glorifies an abusive relationship nothing more take the sex out of it anyone would see how messed up this love is if i was the author i would be ashamed of myself
Feb 14 2015,positive,porn with a plot with this trilogy you truly   need to have  the texts and emails they shared to  follow the mind set from scene to scene and while they did it in the beginning  i felt they needed   to a have the ones shared between the time he visited her at the moms house and her flying   back to seattle   for anyone who didnt read the book it helps you understand   the mindset he was in upon her return in the final showdown
Feb 14 2015,positive,better than the book the movie was good and could have had fewer skin scenes and been just fine the storyline was well captured
Feb 14 2015,negative,really not what i expected think the film has let the book down harry potter would true you on more
Feb 14 2015,positive,really enjoyed the move i had read all the books and new exactly what to expect the media has not portrayed the true story line of this movieits a love story but also the story of christian learning what honesty and trust really is
Feb 14 2015,positive,i thought it was a very good adaptation of the book   very well casted entertaining   dont understand all the bad reviews
Feb 14 2015,positive,this movie was mind blowing if youve read the 50 shades of grey series then youre bound to get wrapped up in this film the actors do an impeccable job of portraying the emotions and demeanors expressed in the books i could watch this movie over and over again
Feb 14 2015,positive,needed to be a bit longer to include missed details still pretty hot and hope they dont make us wait too long for the next installment
Feb 14 2015,positive,a watered down version of a great book
Feb 14 2015,positive,i think it was very well done and very close to what i pictured when i read the book the actors they chose were perfect they missed some details naturally but they did a great job getting things across without getting too much into detail annas wardrobe charlie tango balloon christian telling anna to eat knowing what goes on in the book sure helps
Feb 14 2015,positive,i had low expectations and i was pleasantly surprised i found the inner conflict of the characters to be very engaging although it would have been much better had it been directed by a more distinguish director such as david fincher or the like
Feb 14 2015,negative,such a big waste of time
Feb 14 2015,negative,totally blah experience no chemistry whatsoeverboring
Feb 14 2015,positive,cant wait for part 2
Feb 14 2015,positive,loved it although it was not exactly like the book the love story is still awesome my husband never read the book but really enjoyed the movie
Feb 14 2015,positive,i thought it was very true to the book ending left you wanting more looking forward to fifty shades darker
Feb 14 2015,negative,slow slow very slow i love the soundtrack
Feb 14 2015,positive,pretty decent considering all the hype
Feb 14 2015,negative,this is a very uneven adaptation of the book not only is a good deal left out but moments included are often shorn of the leadup or context that would make their inclusion worthwhile the leads have some chemistry at the beginning but it seems to evaporate as the characters become involved the sex scenes are remarkably dull lots of long slow pans perhaps the best feature dakota johnsons performance she gives us a vivid sense of how confused and how increasingly unhappy anastasia is in this relationship
Feb 14 2015,positive,meh rather disappointed    him not christian and acting sucked    her acting ok except for some overacting but shes too old to be ana    production hollywood please learn how to stick to books granted not as terrible s some books turned movies theres really no need to change and add thingssurprised by that since the author was involved also not thrilled with kate and elliot choices either
Feb 14 2015,positive,loved it exactly like the book
Feb 14 2015,negative,i dont need to watch this to give it more than one star
Feb 14 2015,positive,absolutely brilliant really enjoyed it
Feb 14 2015,negative,zzzzzzzzzz this film was so anticlimactic i felt like i was watching the same scene throughout the whole movie in different settings the typical anxious avoidance relationship i want you but youre no good for me oh please show me your mysterious ways ill change you blah i felt that the scenes that were supposed to evoke an aww moment or stir you in youre seat were so cliche it was humorous so if you are up for a soft core porn with little to zero story line then you might enjoy this film
Feb 14 2015,positive,i went in skeptical but it was better than i thought it was going to be amazing chemistry on the leading roles great job
Feb 14 2015,negative,huh yeah i fell asleep a couple times but i feel like i missed the whole show i am sure i will have fun when i get home and google submissive but that may be all i take from this movie
Feb 14 2015,positive,fabulous casting of christian and ana move was soooo much better than the poorly written book
Feb 14 2015,positive,i just finished watching fifty shades of grey and i really liked it if you read the books and liked it you wont be disappointed of course the movie is not as graphic as the books however both dakota and jamie were pretty good as anastasia and christian would recommend to watch after all it is a love story
Feb 14 2015,negative,the only thing i liked about the movie was anastasias shoes
Feb 14 2015,positive,loved it very true to the book dakota is fantastic as ana and jamie makes a great christian contrary to many critics dakota and jamie have great onscreen chemistry
Feb 14 2015,negative,i expected more this movie it is nothing like the book lacking major details the sex scenes were terrible and just the acting all around
Feb 14 2015,positive,it was so hot it followed the book so perfectly
Feb 14 2015,negative,horribly cheesy dominatrix for dummies super embarrassed that i paid to see this
Feb 14 2015,positive,i was pleasantly surprised for me the main thing is that i liked both of the lead actors the film is a sly fantasy and i enjoyed it at that level call it a guilty pleasure but it held my attention throughout
Feb 14 2015,positive,followed closing to the book a little slow but non the less entertaining hoping for a follow up
Feb 14 2015,negative,a truly painstakingly dull waste of nearly 2 hours   it felt like a 4 hour movie and hardly received any reaction from the audience
Feb 14 2015,negative,clearly this entire story falls apart without the tampon incident
Feb 14 2015,negative,zero plot  cheesy dialogue  extremely boring  one of the worst movies ive seen in a while
Feb 14 2015,negative,this has to be the most dull movie i have ever seen i would rather watch left behind starring nic cage again the actors were trying but the characters lacked any depth and were completely one dimensional and lacked chemistry together all i can say is dull dull dull  i havent read the books but my wife assures me that the movie would have been worse if i had
Feb 14 2015,positive,i loved it  its just like the book the only thing is that was just the 1st book cant wait till the 2nd movie comes out if you havent seen it you must what woman hasnt done some of that lol
Feb 14 2015,positive,i loved it and cant wait for the next one to come out
Feb 14 2015,negative,a movie that romanticizes rape brainwashing abuse and tries to write it off as bdsm this shouldnt have been allowed on the big screen much less a book that looks like it was written by a ten year old this terrible series has already spurred numerous rape and murders and is no doubt nurturing abusive relationships by teaching girls its normal to be abused like this and they need to stick with a toxic man
Feb 14 2015,positive,first i am a fan of both the 50 shades books and twilight series  however once the twilight movies came out i hated them so much i still have not seen the last two movies the acting was horrible and the director choice appalling  that being said when the cast was selected for 50 shades of grey i was nervous it would be a repeat of the twilight disgrace   however after expecting the worse i was happily surprised  dakota did an absolutely amazing job fully acting every emotion ana encounters  it kept the movie playful with the darkness that is christian  the sex scenes were tame compared to the book but still racy although you can hear a bit of irish accent occasionally in jamies portrayal of christian it does not deter at all from his performance guys with accents are hot  everyone who reads a book has a picture of the characters in their mind although jamie was not the picture of grey for me when i read the books he is christian grey to me now  the movie stays true for the most part to the book  they seemed to have shortened several areas of talking but allude to them in other areas so its not fully lost however the best judgement of a film for me is that i was enthralled to the very last second and had not realized we had been watching the movie for that long i was not ready for the movie to end but am eagerly awaiting the release of movies 2 and 3
Feb 14 2015,positive,the actors did an amazing job with their performance they showed ana as a strong independent woman which i liked because no one thinks she is she is in dominant over christian realistically hes the one changing himself she is discovering who she wants to be the sex scenes were intense but also appropriate great job and i really hope their is a second one
Feb 14 2015,positive,enjoyed the movie and it was pretty close to the book i think both jamie and dakota were perfect for the parts and couldnt imagine anyone else playing christian and ana bring on the next two
Feb 14 2015,negative,boring somber not what i expected
Feb 14 2015,positive,having never read the books and just watching this as another film it wasnt too bad there is actually more than just the sex which isnt the only point of the films film was better than i thought but not really my type of film but still good
Feb 14 2015,positive,i liked the movie it was better then i expected i loved the book and while i understand that they cant fit everything into the movie there were things they left out that i would of loved to of seen in the movie i feel like if you havnt read the books you might not get some of the scenes cant wait for the second movie
Feb 14 2015,positive,great valentines day movie  i enjoyed what they did with it good casting overall christian was dark and brooding anastasia was naãve and sweet would have ben nice to have a bit more character development for the supporting cast
Feb 14 2015,negative,i think i saw this movie in the 80s  it was called 9 12 weeks
Feb 14 2015,negative,waste of time and money
Feb 14 2015,positive,it actually makes a decent movie dornan is mischievously handsome fanning acts suitably unsure and naive  and are a likeable on screen couple  the light sm is fantasy enough and creates a light air of sexual tension without the need for gritty realism probably pitched just right for mass cinema consumption the sex titillates and theres a fleeting flash of bush both his and hers without anything feeling overtly pornographic theres also an ice cube scene reminiscent of 9 12 weeks  so in some respect were on a retread of twenty years ago not sure how it will pan out as a film franchise but it certainly has got bums on seats for now  the busiest ive seen a cinema screening in ages 
Feb 14 2015,negative,what the hell this movie is
Feb 14 2015,positive,much better than expected but dont go see it for the sex youll be disappointed this movie is all about feelings and stuff it succeeds in making christian grey passable as a human being kudos to the screenwriters for the dialogue cleanup
Feb 14 2015,positive,loved it if you read the books youll love the movie
Feb 14 2015,positive,i thought that this movie truly captured the emotional part of this book which i have found can be difficult sorry for those of you in search of a porno i would totally recommend it
Feb 14 2015,positive,the movie was good definitely not hard to improve upon the books given they were so poorly written but i definitely didnt have high expectations given the criticism of the actors before it was released i was pleasantly surprised by both leads particularly dakota johnson who was absolutely perfect she brought everything needed for anastasia and even more  especially humor jamie doran came off creepy which works considering his character is well creepy however you see a nice transformation in him over the course of the movie that nicely matches the affect ana is having on him emotionally  i also didnt see any lack of chemistry between the actors as has been rumored    in the end the movie was funnier warmer and better acted than i expected and with far less of the mature subject matter that drove the book it had a story that come through beyond all that one to which a lot of the criticism out there doesnt really stand up take away the hype over the sexual theme and its not a story at all about a woman physically and emotionally submitting to a man but one about how the true need want giving and power of unconditional love can overcome someones belief that they dont actually deserve it one of my high school religion teachers fr orth who liked to find biblical meanings in popular culture music would probably find one in 50 shades of grey    and it had one of the greatest endings of a movie ever that surprised even those who read the books the collective gasp among those in the theater attested to it
Feb 14 2015,positive,i genuinely liked this movie i wasnt expecting this to be some porn fest or anything like that it was way better than the book and classy forget critics reviews go to the theater and make up your own mind imho  dakota and jamie have long careers ahead of them  dakota is a class act and jamie is intense as cg  in the book cg is a brilliant businessman with gadgets galore but hes emotionally withdrawn jamie had to play someone who was emotionally deficient however look at his eyes so much emotion behind them jamie didnt get a bafta nod for nothingjust saying  not being snarky but his eyes do convey the turmoil and moods behind the stiff faced grey blame ej james if you didnt like the linesdont blame the actors who are truly talented  and have to work with what lines they are given
Feb 14 2015,negative,very disappointing could not wait for the film to end
Feb 14 2015,negative,aka twilight with no vampires but a lot of sex
Feb 14 2015,positive,excellenti didnt know what to expect since i am probably one of the few who did not read the books but i was pleasantly surprised  very tastefully donei will definitely see it again
Feb 14 2015,positive,the glamourised jealous abuser will see you now i have so many issues with this whole idea but its an ok adaptation if nothing else visually seattle has not looked this stunning since frasier
Feb 14 2015,negative,i thought it was awful and i didnt stay for the whole movie didnt feel like there was any chemistry between dornan and johnson so it felt fake to me  what a mess
Feb 14 2015,negative,just as good as the book 
Feb 14 2015,negative,doesnt even deserve a star this movie sucks real bad
Feb 14 2015,negative,i didnt hate the movie as much as i thought i would but fifty shades of grey is exactly what its title says just multiple permutations of the same bad thing its a smokey plot with a very drab premise  that love can somehow solve even the most muddied lives its actors specifically mr grey himself cannot act even if their lives depended on it and not even christians adonislike physique can save his leaded performance throw in copious amounts of cinereous sanitized love scenes sanitized because the book seems to describe more action than debbie does dallas and youve got yourselves a livid film worthy of being the next twilight franchise yup i didnt hate it that much imagine what more i would have to say if i did one and a half stars
Feb 14 2015,positive,50 shades of brilliant enjoyed this film so much took my hubbie who also thought it was great cant wait for the sequels captured the same intensity as the books great film
Feb 14 2015,positive,think the movie  portraits the book well if the movie was made as intense as the book it would be border line porn and would never pass for a movie played at the theater if you have read the book i think you appreciate what was done
Feb 14 2015,positive,it amazes me the juvenile people that attended this movie last night in the theater i went to  giggles giggles  sure there were  scenes that had a bit of light heartedness to them but there is a wonderful storyline about love and growth of 2 individuals from completely different spectrums of life  yes this is a hot movie but look beyond the skin  i absolutely loved it and waiting for the next chapter
Feb 14 2015,positive,tastefully done sassy and fun  kept true to the book with only a few deviations  the main actors did well personifying the characters  i went into the movie with no expectations and enjoyed it immensely  i went with someone who had never read the books and she loved it as well  definitely doesnt disappoint when you put aside your own images from the book and just enjoy the movie as it is
Feb 14 2015,negative,this movie is supposed to be about a bdsm relationship instead it is about emotional abuse none of the emotionally manipulative things christian is doing are ok in a healthy kinky or not relationship
Feb 14 2015,positive,much better story and graphic but not as bad as i thought
Feb 14 2015,negative,with its misogynistic overtone along with shallow characters and hardly any plot fifty shades of grey is a horrible example of a modern day romance story thatll makes me question why people enjoy reading this book that this film was adapted from after i discovered that this was originally twilight fan fiction all i have to say was that twilight all is forgiven
Feb 14 2015,positive,i was fairly pleased with the movie  the producer did a great job sticking as close to the book as possible
Feb 14 2015,positive,absolutely amazing movie jamie dornan and dakota johnson did a phenomenal job capturing and creating the characters in the the book it was way better than i expected the movie was definitely shocking but it brought the pages of 50 shades to life i hope that the do indeed make movies out of the next two books dont listen to the critics see the movie and make up your own mind
Feb 14 2015,neutral,many changes from the book the actor is not like christian on the book here he is softer and i just dont think he is that hot sex scenes were meh
Feb 14 2015,negative,horse shit on a vomit taco
Feb 14 2015,positive,great movie had me on the edge of my seat
Feb 14 2015,positive,as good as could be  sill get an r readers digest version of the book
Feb 14 2015,negative,what every girl needs on valentines day a nice xrated twilight feel movie if not for jamie dornan i wouldve walked out 
Feb 14 2015,positive,its a really good movie  it definitely keeps your attention
Feb 14 2015,positive,this was amazing i accidentally summed on the person in front of me but this a great experience i dont care what people say i love this film   
Feb 14 2015,positive,read the books before watching the movie and yall understand why it ends the way it does it did leave a few parts out from the book but understandable since we all know the movie cant be too long cant wait for fifty shades darker
Feb 14 2015,positive,i have not read the books and only heard crazy things about the series but the movie was just okay some of the scenes were intense and pretty damn exciting but i still dont really know what the story is about beyond all the sex obviously there are other parts to the movie and the end leaves you intrigued as to what happens didnt mind the cast at all thought they were pretty good for the roles if youre a guy make sure you go see this with a girl lol
Feb 14 2015,positive,to be honest this movie was better than i expected  the acting was good the pace was good the plot held my attention  i didnt read the books but i didnt have to to enjoy this show  there has been a lot of talk about the bdsm aspects of the movie  all i can say is men and women alike enjoy dominant and submissive sex  if it were a dominatrix doing her thing it would be more palatable to some but it is not abuse if both are consenting adults  while the sex is a bit graphic ive seen worse on hbo series  my advice is to put all the hype aside and just go to the movie and enjoy it  i did
Feb 14 2015,negative,it was ridiculous to the point it was hilarious the production of the movie was fine but the scrip is very messed up i mean he broke into her house twice sold her car without her consent he controls who she sees what she eats her exercises routine its abusive relationship 101
Feb 14 2015,negative,the whole cast is all wrong except maybe for christians parents dakota johnson makes a horrible anastasia and jamie dornan is not even half as  hot as christian is supposed to be
Feb 14 2015,negative,awful glorifies an abusive relationship actors clearly do not like each other you can clearly tell this started off as twilight fanfiction because its the same sort of shit that was just r rated
Feb 14 2015,neutral,was ok dakota johnson ruined it for us
Feb 14 2015,positive,this movie is a gorgeous swoonworthy love story i read the books and i loved the portrayal of them i got to see on screen dakota is a treasure with fabulous comic timing and jamie acts with his eyes so wonderfully he adds a layer of mystery the soundtrack is bananas every song is getting replayed over and over this film is obviously the result of a lot of care to important details in the book its fantastic to see a film helmed by so many strong women about a man that is concerned about the female orgasm i cant think of a story where the womans gratification was so paramount well done
Feb 14 2015,negative,very dissappointing fell asleep twice
Feb 14 2015,positive,great movie from what i expected it is twilight fan fiction with sex did you expect it to be epic  no it will never win an award but i promise i will see every sequel   laters baby
Feb 14 2015,negative,how many ways are there to say rubbish
Feb 14 2015,negative,one star for effort totally missed a lot of parts from the book that i felt were important to include wheres all the real drama i was hoping theyd capture on the big screen definitely needed better looking actors and actresses because christian grey and anastasia steele were way better looking from the way id imagined them to be during the 3 times i read each book movie was a total disappointment for me
Feb 14 2015,neutral,because im fifty shades of fuckedup
Feb 14 2015,negative,i was very disappointed with the entire movie  all of the hype for nothing  the movie soundtrack was amazing  e l james should write a new book from christians perspective  please no more movies  your fans are waiting for a new book
Feb 14 2015,positive,it was decently entertaining
Feb 14 2015,positive,i actually love it i think that people were expecting the whole book to be i the movie also if you didnt know anything about the book you cant really understand to me a lot of people were already being negative about the movie so with that being said comes a lot of criticism i loved it and i cannot wait for part two
Feb 14 2015,negative,its a crap mediocre wasted my money 
Feb 14 2015,negative,simply terrible by far the worst move ive ever seen could you make the domsub lifestyle any more cheesy what a joke
Feb 14 2015,positive,as a fan of the trilogy i was in between pleased and disappointed i felt the dialogue between the characters was too fast pace not intense enough however the sex scenes were great hopefully the next two films will improve
Feb 14 2015,negative,softporn tragiccomedy with loads of nudity and he plays piano after sex ah yes its badly acted too at least he has a nice body hmm
Feb 14 2015,negative,ive always stated that boredom is the laziest state of being and if youre bored its probably your fault then i saw this film and i didnt really think being bored during this thing was my faultat all
Feb 14 2015,negative,i would rather listen to dora the explorer
Feb 14 2015,negative,when this movie breaks 200 mil all the critics on here will make a 180 degree about face about it  worst part about the movie is now all the soccer moms will be into sm translation so it will no longer be cool  cant believe the people on here who dont go to see the movie and still rate it and give it a one start  dakota grows on you and by the end of the movie is hot  jamie falls short  there were a few roll your eyes parts during this flick mostly reffering to the cheesy dialog when she asks logical questions and he gives these completely irrational answers that leave you going what really  oh this just in rope zip tie and tape sells are up 27 lol
Feb 14 2015,negative,i thought the film followed the book very well and you were able to see why christian is the way he is so i am looking forward to the next movies
Feb 14 2015,positive,i hated the book couldnt even make it through the whole thing because of the bad writing and not caring about the main character because she was portrayed as so dumb in the movie ana is transformed into a smart woman who actually almost reels in the elusive grey i liked it thank goodness for screenwriters to make a watchable movie out of that horrible source material is impressive
Feb 14 2015,negative,this movie fell short of expectations all the talk about the book set this expectations so high i think the cast was to young for this topic you never get a chance to put yourself in one of the roles either as   the dominant or submissive they should have kept him more superficial and more into his work grey is supposed to be a control freak but yet he cant control anything about the deal hes putting together with this 20 something virgin he just met how can you believet he runs a multimillion dollar company you cant also i didnt get excited not once whats up with that  i think this was a watered down version of 9 12 weeks now that was a turn on
Feb 14 2015,positive,so hot and steamy and a beautiful romantic love story just like the book
Feb 14 2015,positive,everything that was right and wrong about the movie fifty shades of grey    okay i know everyone has been hearing about this movie and a bunch of you curious souls have already gone to seen it if you havent seen it yet and just want the bottom line here it is go see it its really not that bad    the first thing that was refreshing to see was that they pretty much followed the book exactly there wasnt any of that feeling of oh whyd they change that part the book was so much better unfortunately that also means that a few of the impossibly corny lines from the book anastasia its just the way i am also made it into the movie and made for some pretty terrible moments that said they did find a clever way to show you the email and instant messaging banter which made me smile when i read the book it was good to see they found a way to keep it in there    thankfully i thought that the actors did a great job of conveying the nonverbal communication the intense eye contact and body language that goes into seduction despite having no inner monologue to listen in on the inner goddess is graciously not mentioned you really get a good feel for the tension that builds overall and other than a few forced oneliners that you could tell the actors hated they did a fantastic job of accurately portraying the characters in the book    the sex scenes were hot there i said it they really were better than anything ive seen of late and surprisingly realistic i even enjoyed watching the slow controlled way that he introduced progressively more intense activities to her dakota johnson has a smoking hot body and watching her reactions was well just go watch it    on the bdsm side of things im going to come right out and say that this is probably the best mainstream movie about bdsm thats been made so far there are some serious issues that ill get into later but overall they did a great job of explaining safe words hes very serious about getting her consent and making sure shes safe they also got into some of the nitty gritty details of a domsub contract which was interesting and mostly accurate    and thats about where the good parts end there are two main issues that i take with the story fifty shades of grey starting with    christian is portrayed as being into bdsm because of some dark deep childhood abuse or trauma that is lightly alluded to in the story he says he has to be this way and that hes fifty shades of fucked up unfortunately this gives the impression that anyone that is into bdsm must be fucked up mentally and this is their weird twisted way of dealing with their issues now this isnt to say that some people in the bdsm community do have terrible ordeals they dealt with as children but by and large most people are into bdsm because well its fun its hot its sexy its taboo and dirty and something you dont tell your parents about people like things like that and its okay on to major issue two    anna doesnt have the slightest interest in being a submissive this isnt to say that women who have never learned about submission wont develop an interest once being gently introduced to it pro tip walking an innocent young woman into your play room which looks like a fancy version of a dungeon from the spanish inquisition and then slapping down a masterslave contract in front of her is not a gentle introduction     however we learn during the story that even after playing out a few very hot scenes with christian she still doesnt really have any interest in being his submissive really she just wants a vanilla relationship with a really hot confident guy that just happens to be a billionaire and this is where the story takes its turn for the worse because now we have this character christian who has all these problems and sweet little vanilla anna whos going to fix him and turn him into a regular vanilla boyfriend    which again gives off the impression that anyone thats into bdsm is broken and needs to be fixed     the problem is compounded by the fact that anna is a completely innocent and sexually sheltered woman not to mention fairly plain looking whos now being wooed by this billionaire yes with a b playboy rides in his helicopter rides in his exotic sports cars getting a new laptop getting new car etc from a certain point of view it becomes a story about some super rich guy seducing and taking advantage of a hopeless young country girl and lets face it    christian is a total psycho control freak and this is the message that i especially want all women who are curious about domination and submission to hear steer clear of anyone you meet that does things like christian grey showing up where you work uninvited creepy tracking your cell phones location and then showing up there creepy stripping you naked and putting you to bed while youre unconscious creepy giving you death ray eyes because you look or talk to another male creepy okay real dominants the good ones that are doing this for fun and excitement and mutual enjoyment dont need to coerce or convince or bribe women to submit to them curious women want to do it they might even beg for it    the final scene and the final nail in the coffin involves christian pushing anna way beyond her limits something a real dom would never do interestingly the vibe given off by both of them when entering that final scene felt very accurate meaning it was all wrong regardless of what requests got made a good dom would have put a stop to that right then and there and sometimes he has to make that call and then of course we have the abrupt ending which leaves everyone sitting there like what just happened remember this is book one of three the story is supposed to continue    my final word on the movie is that its a sexy ride that you should go on but be aware of the differences between reality and fiction      what you should do if youre curious about exploring sexual submission    first do your research there are lot of good resources online talk to other submissives and dominants and ask questions take your time dont jump into anything and make sure that the dominant is going at your pace not theirs look for certain cues for example the dominant should be asking you a lot of questions early on questions about your limits your desires fantasies curiosities if all they talk about is what they want to do or if they keep steering you towards a certain fantasy or activity even though its not something you are interested in just walk away a good dom takes time to find and there are plenty of guys out there that hide their abusive tendencies by claiming to be a dom watch for the signs    while its reasonable when youre in a relationship with someone that they ask you stay sexually exclusive with them banning you from friendships with other guys or getting angry if you talk to or look at another guy is a big warning sign you want a dom to help you fulfill your fantasies not an insecure boyfriend whos going to fly into a jealous rage if another male comes up a good dom knows his value he doesnt fret when he cant keep an eye on his submissive if she wants to go thats what she should do    while most dominants will impose certain rules as a condition of the relationship the rules should be reasonable and most of all they should be fun for example telling you to wear a skirt and no panties to work is a fun sexy enjoyable rule you get to spend the day knowing youre doing something that pleases your dom and it makes you feel like a dirty little slut while youre doing it thats great thats what were doing and its completely okay making a rule that you have to text him twice an hour telling him where you are because he doesnt trust you is not a fun sexy enjoyable rule we have a name for that and that name is psycho control freak dont confuse men who are dominant with men who are abusive    your potential dominant should be very interested in your life and encourage uplift mentor and inspire you he should make you feel good about yourself sexy and beautiful and desirable he should treat your submission as a gift a precious gift that youve given of your own free will and desire one that you have the right to take away at any time a gift he has earned and you trust him with this isnt to say that you may have dark or even extreme desires that you want to explore but at the end of the day being a dom is about helping a sub safely discover the deeper levels of her sexuality if hes only concerned about what he wants or makes you feel bad about yourself walk away    a bad dominant can really hurt you and really mess up your life but a good dom can give you everything you ever dreamed of he can help you let go and discover heights of pleasure and erotic pain you never imagined possible choose carefully
Feb 14 2015,negative,graphic and porn on big screen do not see
Feb 14 2015,positive,movie was entertaining if you read the booksso you can understand the intensity ana feelsbook will always be betterbut good movie
Feb 14 2015,positive,movie was not that bad i do feel though it felt rushed which made it a bit boring at times it was lacking a more dramatic touch and a more dominant grey in the play room scenes i do think dornan and johnson did a great job i would definitely  watch the squeals
Feb 14 2015,neutral,it kills me to have to give this movie a 2 212 jamie dornan looked more nervous then dominant we seen close ups of dakotas lips as much as we seen her boobs and are we not missing pretty important story from the book that could have taken this movie to another level where the exstalker sub the creepy new boss if they realm are going to do two more movies they need new director news producer and maybe el james to wrote the screenplay put an nc17 rating on it make poor jamie  take a few domsub training sessions
Feb 14 2015,negative,its bad like oh my god is it bad the dialogue is unbelievable the pacing is painful and the storyline is redundant its been about 15 minutes since i walked out of the theater and i already have forgotten most everything i saw
Feb 14 2015,negative,absolutely awful allegedly kinky sex has never been so pretentious or so tedious the only tension on the movie was the question is this over yet
Feb 14 2015,neutral,i read the entire trilogy of fifty shades and i found them okay the quality of the writing leaves a lot to be desired since i had read the books i figured i might as well jump on the movie bandwagon and see it went opening night theatre wasnt even half full which i was surprised at i physically felt awkward through half the movie because the characters were just so awkward it left so much to be desired the dialog was ultra cheesy and almost cringe worthy the sex scenes could have been so much more erotic instead we got mediocre spanking with some breasts thrown in if they make more perhaps theyll up the spice a bit i actually kept wondering how much longer the movie would be it was just sodroll after the movie all i heard was complaints from women about how awful it was and how the actor playing christian wasnt attractive i have to agree with that while he isnt ugly he isnt anything close to how i picture this man that is supposed to be so hot
Feb 14 2015,positive,ive read reviews on this movie on several different platforms the constant is people saying how its not like the books when are the movies ever like the books  a book is not a screenplay i went and saw this on opening night 212 the movie is the theory of book one in fast forward the scenes are very similar to what happened in the book but with the differences that make it for the big screen sex is down played to allow for the r rating but by no means leaving someone lacking as to what is implied my friend and i who are huge fans of the books enjoyed the movie for what it was a movie i knew it would not hold a candle to the books but was a good film and enjoyed it we are interested to see how they manage the sequels     for those whom state that this was supposed to be huge in sex scenes if you havent read the books or remember them well the hardcore sex scenes dont come into play until book 2  book 1 was them getting together and a lot of the vanilla sex the red room was used only once in book 1
Feb 14 2015,negative,it was beyond a disappointment the sex scenes sucked whoever did the screen play just didnt get the book at all with how rich el james when she watched the movie she shouldve canceled it and started over i wish the movie was 6 hours or more long they cut out all the best parts her losing her virginity was pathetic the girl cant moan to save her life and they had zero connection his reaction to her being a virgin was pathetic i wouldve given it zero stars if i could have not trying to sound dramatic the book was hot as hell he was the worst part of the movie hes not hot intimidating tall nothing what christian grey is it shouldve been a porn thats what us readers read everyone in the theatre was laughing during it and after i heard a ton of people saying they hated it huge huge huge disappointment
Feb 14 2015,negative,though i was relatively late to the 50 shades craze i eventually read the series and was pleasantly surprised that it was considerably more to it than just porn between pages of a book however i was curious to see how this would be translated into a movie that could be publicly released without an xrating yet stayed true enough to the intense sexualness that it was more than just a glorified lifetime movie lofty expectations ill admit but still possible i thought apparently i was wrong i understand people were looking for hot sex scenes because after all that is the core of the book but was it really necessary to completely bypass at least a little plot and character development to get there again apparently yes it definitely helps to have read the books to get any understanding of what is supposed to be going on but it is a small consolation after wasting two hours and spending a small fortune in tickets and popcorn if you are going in blind meaning havent read the book and just looking for some steamy sex scenes to get your motor running you would be better off streaming free porn on the internet at least they are honest about what you are getting it was not the worst movie i have ever seen though none come to mind at the moment that being said the only thing i left with was feeling fairly certain that if i ever had to i could pick out dakota johnsons naked breasts and buttocks in a police lineup considering how much time we were given to study them throughout the movie maybe the next installment should go straight to showtime or starz at least i am already paying for those channels anyway
Feb 14 2015,negative,had no idea what the movie or book was about but my wifes friends all claimed they loved the book and even chose it for the book at book club so i figured id take my daughter and her friend to see it they are both in middle school to say i was surprised is an understatement had no idea that the book my wife and all of her friends enjoyed is equivalent to me spending an hour watching some of the most hardcore porn on pornhub jesus people seriously what happened to the world like ughhh smh speechless
Feb 14 2015,positive,i have read a lot about the giggling in the movie theaters during this movie most think its because people didnt read the book i completely disagree i read the book and giggled through the movie more so because i knew was going to happen next or i knew the parts that were not showing on the screen i felt in all the screen film did a good job played the stay true to the book there were a few times i did feel like jamie dornan was reading his lines straight off the pages of the book dakota johnson however did a wonderful job playing the role of anastasia going in to the movie i wasnt excited about either actor choice and quite honestly i thought they would ruin the book for me dakota johnson was perfect i would recommend that if your going to see the movie read the book first so you can fully appreciate what the giggling is all about i think it could have been better but is was definitely better than i thought it was going to be going in
Feb 14 2015,positive,as a fan of the books it would be expect that i like this movie and i do  the photography was great the shotsthe sets the music the clothes were all great and in keeping with what i pictured  dakota johnson won me over with her performance but i had low expectations for her performance  jamies accent was throwing me off as it was very obvious to me  i know he is a good actor bbcs the fall but felt a bit robotic in this performance  maybe this is how him and sam taylor envisioned christian  overall i enjoyed the movie  i would have preferred less female nudity  it wasnt really needed to see her naked that much  i wish they would have kept it on an even keel  laters
Feb 14 2015,negative,laughable more than erotic i was embarrassed that i took my date
Feb 14 2015,positive,loved it i like how they made it seem kinda funny cant wait for part 2
Feb 14 2015,negative,there is so much technical ineptitude in the core of the story that no matter how  pretty the cinematography is there is focus on all the wrong things it tries to be erotic with no organic romance to work with the characters have a pretense of depth and complexity but all is just derivative and shallow reasons that does not have the weight they think it has  embarrassing dialogue and a direction a music placement that is as manipulative and shallow as christian grey himself
Feb 14 2015,negative,i want to punch her in her lip
Feb 14 2015,neutral,ladies will love it not sure about the guys
Feb 14 2015,positive,they did as well as they could in the amount of time theres just too many juicy details in the book to fit on the screen in one movie the next movies should probably be stretched into 2 parts to fit everything in and make it a better viewing experience
Feb 14 2015,negative,when a book is terrible the movie follows
Feb 14 2015,positive,it was pretty good but the ending was kind of wierd but very hot indeed
Feb 14 2015,negative,worst movie i have seen at the theaters in years  dont waste your   if you must see it wait for red box at 150
Feb 14 2015,negative,fifty shades of grey is the film adaptation of the book by the same name this is the prime example that if the source material is crap the movie will not make it better if we call this for what it is it is porn for females at least porn knows what it is this monstrosity wants to be a movie and got a theatrical release this whole thing started as twilight fan fiction which should have been red flag 1and became a very poorly written novel there is no substance to the characters nothing they do makes any sense and there was absolutely no chemistry between the two main actors in the film i must say however dakota johnson was great this chick acted her tail off and i am excited to see her do better things in the future for a movie where sex is supposed to be what drives it and why people are going to see it the movie was not sexy at all  before you say well that is from a mans point of view i screened this with a date and  she hated it worse than i did in fact when i asked people after the movie what their thoughts were the women had the worst reviews of all to make a long story short dont waste your time go see kingsman
Feb 14 2015,negative,brutal i would have had more fun as a 45 yr old male watching spongebob what a waste of 2 hrs please dont spend your money youll never get those 2 hrs back
Feb 14 2015,positive,very close to the book the characters have great chemistry most people giving it a bad review are probably people not into that kind of stuff or are very straight but everyone knew what it was about before they went happy humping
Feb 14 2015,positive,it is just what a movie should be it fills up your senses on many levels
Feb 14 2015,positive,loved the movie it gave me what i wanted
Feb 14 2015,negative,dont waste your time or money on this onethe book is better what a turd can i get my 2 hours back 
Feb 14 2015,neutral,the movie is sensually sexual erotically twisteddefinitely not for children
Feb 14 2015,positive,i thought they could have hit on some other things a little more i really enjoyed the book coming to life however i understand how the literature was more appealing because it was more detailed putting a movie in the box office  hitting more on the love story behind it all i believe was more theater appropriate they should have just made it a porno and everyone would be more satisfied
Feb 14 2015,neutral,while i knew this was no academy award winner before i waked through the door i was at least hoping for some on screen chemistry dakota johnson was perfect but her costar was lacking many of the christian grey qualities from the novel had no chemistry with dakota and was just flat out a bad choice for this role
Feb 14 2015,negative,fifty shades of sosopoorly cast leadsslow stars lack chemistry and skims over the story line took muchcharlie hunnan would have been more believable as grey it doesnt help that jamie is promoting the film with a dirty woodsman beardyuk
Feb 14 2015,positive,very close to the book  i believe that the true book was not ruined
Feb 14 2015,positive,despite the bad quality of the book they made a great movie i liked it
Feb 14 2015,negative,i knew going in that it would be bad because the book was so poorly written the best scenes were the opening scene and the very last scene neither had any dialect   dont waste time or money
Feb 14 2015,positive,surprisingly after reading all the bad reviews i thought this movie was perfect it wasnt meant to be a classic movie if you read the books it was almost dead on i didnt think the movie could grasp all the sex and it did i even felt myself blush several times left nothing to the imagination this was not for anyone under 18 maybe even under 30 i hated the actor choices but i will say they were wonderful on the big screen  although he isnt my christian  both actors had a lot of chemistry and humor if you loved the books and relieve that the story line is about sexual self discovery then you will enioy i really think people that have this movie a bad review never read the books or where so fixated on who they seen anna and christian would look like they couldnt get past the fact that the story line is almost dead on the only thing i hate about it is that i have to wait a whole year for the next one 
Feb 14 2015,positive,the book wasnt exactly well written so the movie wasnt going to be phenomenal because of the book they were given to work with both characters played the parts perfectly and the scenes we had all been anticipating definitely left us all wanting more i cant wait to see it again
Feb 14 2015,positive,not as erotic as the book but fun to see with your girlfriends
Feb 14 2015,negative,save your money and watch porn alone at home on the internet
Feb 14 2015,positive,loved the film although i felt you would have missed a lot of little but important points if you had not read the books  dakota johnson performance was right on  jamie dorman although intense as christian should be seemed uncomfortable in everything but the sex scenes which were amazing  not sure how they are going to segway into book 2 without at least mentioning leilas name and anas job interview in this movie when they are 80 of book 2 i also felt the last conversation before she leaves should have been filmed exactly as in the book  it was involved but so important  would i see it more than once absolutely   looking forward to darker   oh yes
Feb 14 2015,negative,as bad as the book not eroticnot romantic jamie dornan is hot very cose to the bookjust as badly written and cringy great music the stars are for the music
Feb 14 2015,negative,only because its in seattle do i give any stars to this flick
Feb 14 2015,positive,can i just say what honestly were you expecting to see for those of you saying its largely about abuse i find this almost offensive to the bdsm community secondly this movie copies the book almost identically so theres not really anything else they could have done to have fulfilled your unrealistic wishes like the book it depicts an intelligent successful young man who is quite messed up due to his childhood he is drawn to dakota who is a intelligent attractive but insecure young girl which is what he find attractive in a womanas we all have to find something attractive and yes its not your generic love story which comes out on valentines day endless love buts its something else which not only has love but other different and interesting  components these being the mental health of christian and the bdsmthe bdsm is not a mental health its a type of relationship he is into having
Feb 14 2015,negative,got bored bad acting bad storyline what was all the hype about
Feb 14 2015,positive,fifty shades of grey is haunting sensual intense and even scary and held aloft by two strong performances
Feb 14 2015,positive,loved the movie it was tasteful funny and sexy really enjoyed having the book come to life not sure what everyone else expected by giving all these bad reviews maybe they didnt read the books  i cant wait for the next one and all these comments of domestic violence and whatever come on get over your self 50 shades has nothing to do with that if anything it can actually help some people better their own sex lives i just loved loved loved it 50 shades of thanks
Feb 14 2015,negative,wheres the lovethey made christian cold and lacking of love for anaboth actors seemed shy to play their roles should have rated it x and hired 2 porn stars that could actwell at least i have my audio books
Feb 14 2015,positive,i really enjoyed it regardless that some of scenes arent in it i really loved the way the actors portrayed the characters i thought they did a good job people need to stop nitpicking this isnt oscars worthy stuff it just a fun movie enjoy it people geez  i cant wait for the other films
Feb 14 2015,positive,never read the book but loved this movie it was more then expected and didnt want it to end
Feb 14 2015,neutral,dakota johnson does the heavy lifting carrying all of the hype of the 50 shades phenomenon and delivering a fine performance the movie as a whole is slow paced and has the feel of a slicker produced late night softcore cable film i am probably not the target audience for this film but i am more confused by the fifty shades phenomenon than by the story itself fifty shades of grey doesnt seem to be original so why the popularity of such a smutty paperback dressed up as erotic fiction after seeing the film i am more confused by the popularity than i was before though i hope to see dakota johnson if better films
Feb 14 2015,negative,the much anticipated fifty shades was a poor sm movie anna really wants to fall for this guy but all he says hes into is tying women up and beating their butts with a riding crop anna cant stand that at the end of the film and tells him never to touch her again and gives back the goodies he gave her and walks away people in the theater thought this would be a love story for valentines day think again
Feb 14 2015,positive,i liked it   johnson is a perfect anastasiait followed the book pretty well  if you liked the book youll like this movie
Feb 14 2015,positive,interesting chic flick
Feb 14 2015,negative,it doesnt matter how much talent you have in front of or behind the camera with this material you cant polish bullshit because it will always be bullshit 
Feb 14 2015,positive,i enjoyed this movie because it has sex and nakedness everyone should go see it but it is a poor representation of what a healthy dominant submissive relationship is    dakota johnson did a fantastic job very well acted jamie dornan on the other hand was terrible he always had the same scrunchy faced l am trying to look dominant look    christian grey is a child someone who admits himself to being fifty shades of fucked up has no business being a dominant a dominant needs to have his own shit together before he can be responsible for the health and happiness of a submissive grey doesnt even consider what ana needs much of the time just how impressive he thinks he is in his red room or how much money he can throw around    i would like to see a movie about someone whose life is out of control because of low self esteem and bad decisions until they meet someone who isnt wealthy but knows how to take control and teach them their worth in and out of the bedroom    fifty shades of grey as a story about a fake wanna be dominant is just fine i am so critical of it because whether it was intended to be or not it is the first mainstream story about a ds relationship and it isnt representing it very well    so go see it but dont think you learned anything about what a dominant submissive relationship should be
Feb 14 2015,negative,so over hyped up and sadly just as disappointing as i figured it would bewaited over an hour and a half for anything sexually interesting to happen and even that was a disappointmentthe problem is his soulless selfclearly and even admittedly a psychopath who needs to hurt someone so he doesnt whatidkkill rape or hurt others wowso not a true interpertation of any sm relationshipjust the opposite and shes patheticfunny tho sad i was correct in my negative view of it even before i saw it because now its even far worsethe theaterliterally erupted in laughter at the enda blank screenthey laughedive never heard that before in a movieits was a horrible endinga horrible movie
Feb 14 2015,negative,pretty terrible dont waste your time     note i left after 30 minutes so perhaps it gets better but i doubt it p
Feb 13 2015,negative,the movie did not give justice to the book it just made christian grey seem like a control freak for no reason it didnt give his back story which made the film miss its point also his ex subs arent in it wtf
Feb 13 2015,positive,expected the worst due to others reviews but left fully entertained
Feb 13 2015,negative,if there was a way to give this less than 12 a star i would there is no way to describe how bad this movie was the acting was dreadful sex scenes were tedious and boring and the chemistry between the leads was awkward at best dakota johnson was just plain hard to watch bowl cut and all and dornan was robotic with a permanent grimace on his face like he had a bad case of gas half way through the movie the audience was actually starting to laugh at parts that were not intended to be funny but the movie really was so pathetic all you could do was laugh at the pain of sitting through it and the memory of the 11 dollars you would never get back the books were a sad state of writing and unfortunately the movie befell the same fate plus some dont waste your time or money
Feb 13 2015,positive,loved itvery true to the book
Feb 13 2015,positive,not as bad as i thought it would be but complete mom porn
Feb 13 2015,positive,nicely and creatively done not easy to translate book into movie dakotas acting is actually surprisingly good  different emotions portrayed effectively jamie is a little stoic liked the film
Feb 13 2015,neutral,i read all three books the movie was pretty much like the first book for me i had a hard time connecting with anastasia and christian in the movie the book was steamy and these actors just didnt pull off the passion i was disappointed
Feb 13 2015,negative,disgusting not cause bdsm but because of the romanticized abusive realtionship
Feb 13 2015,negative,this movie is fucking awful
Feb 13 2015,negative,it was terrible how did they get a greenlight on this project
Feb 13 2015,negative,the movie definitely didnt climax and hit a plateau at the beginning of the movie underwhelmed
Feb 13 2015,negative,a piece of crap film that should have never been made im one of those people that have not read the book and after watching this i dont ever plan on it i dont care what they may have gotten right in the movie from the book i just care about how the movie is made and it was made really poorly the story is really weak and bland the dialogue is some of the worst i have ever heard the directing is bad and the two leads had terrible chemistry on screen this film makes me wonder what made the book so special because there was nothing special about anything being adapted here it is basically an r rated bdsm version of twilight the romance in the movie is awful and cheesy in so many ways the way they go along with their relationship doesnt make sense and it wasnt genuine or heartfelt at all the conversations between them were terrible and uninteresting the sex scenes were boring and they are the only thing that make it different from other terrible bland romance films like the twilight series the dialogue was so god awful that i couldnt believe that the writers thought it was good enough to be told on screen and it also baffled me that my theater audience laughed at it all while i was sighing and groaning at it all jamie dornan did such a terrible job in the movie he was unlikable he was stiff bland and dull throughout the whole movie and had zero charm and personality to him in a romance film the two romantic leads have to have great chemistry and the leads here had no good chemistry at all it was boring to watch and just got depressing as the film went on christian grey is doing all these terrible things to anastasia and anastasia kept coming back to him and it just made no sense another thing that brought down the movie was that there was no character development you dont get to know anything about anastasia or christian a bigger hint on christians past would have shown why he is the way he is but no the film would rather just show endless sex scenes and them talking about their relationship rather than them getting to know and love each other the only positives i could name are that dakota johnson did show some good acting and that the cinematography was very good and fit the tone of the film but they were not enough to give it one star because of how bad everything else was  in the end i really hated this film and it is an abomination against humanity and it baffles me that it is gonna make a lot of money that it does not deserve because there is nothing compelling going on here and it is two hours of crap
Feb 13 2015,negative,i literally had to pinch myself to stay awake during this movie pretty boring  way too long
Feb 13 2015,negative,i honestly expected more out of this movie quite boring for such a sex driven movie
Feb 13 2015,negative,awful one of the worst movies ive ever seen  i would of rather  watched two girls one cup for two hours and have paid the same price than to have watched that garbage zero stars
Feb 13 2015,positive,cant wait for part two  little differences between the book and movie but that was expected  over all excellent movie
Feb 13 2015,negative,filthy shame of greys lack thereof or the unintended virtue of audience  by rob feight    when the girl twentysomethings were buzzing about a book titled as though it was intended to assist passionate monochromatic painters with technique i hardly took notice a couple of months afterwards when the buzz had turned into giggled whispers at housewife round tables and on the radio my curiosity peeked open nary an eyelid    three years a movie and a cringe worthy mountain of negative reviews later and now hopefully just maybe this fraudulent lecherous abduction of the classically beloved story of cinderella will extinguish itself though from the droves of moviegoers that have seemingly been going to bed unfulfilled that fire may already be gonewith much the same speed in which a shallow lustfully founded relationship fizzles    the sooner the significant others of hard working average guys can cease daydreaming about this fallacy the better
Feb 13 2015,negative,some book are just not ment to be a movie i laughed so hard in the whole movie it was so terrible and annoying i got so bored never again the way it end i just though to myself that there shouldnt even be a second movie
Feb 13 2015,positive,read the books enjoyed the movie
Feb 13 2015,positive,great movie followed the plot of the book but cut some parts out a must see for any reader of the trilogy
Feb 13 2015,negative,casting wasnt accurate enough compared to the book and the details werent accurate compared to the book and some scenes were out of order which messed it up and some important scenes were left out of the book which sadly made this movie a big disappointment
Feb 13 2015,positive,it was alright i mean its one of those movies that raises your eyebrow but you want to question why was this made
Feb 13 2015,negative,lacks plot and character development disappointing
Feb 13 2015,negative,i have seen some pretty bad movies in my day i will watch just about anything and every horrible movie i have seen has at least one redeeming quality that makes it watchable  fifty shades is that rare movie that had nothing at all in it that was even remotely good  we all know this movie will makes millions just because of the success of the book and i feel bad for every other movie out there that is so much better but not a big money earner  first off when you are making a hyper sexualized film you have to cast attractive leads that will appeal to everyone  they failed on both parts as dakota johnson is just an average looking female and jamie dornan looked like he worked out in the gym for a week before having to have his shirt off in every scene  the dialogue was weak and clique the acting was below average however dakota was the best and the storyline went nowhere  every movie needs to lead up to something reach a high point and have conflict and arrive at an ending but 50 shades thought they could do without any of that  now dont get me wrong i am a sucker for a good love story but you actually have to create a relationship and show affection between two people to make it believable and none of that was present in this one  i am sure most people are going into this thinking that the best part will be the sex scenes and they turn out to highly underwhelming  they seemed to forced and nothing was natural and it was like the directors tried to hard to make it intense and over the top but it fell flat  i could go on but i think my point has been made and dont even get me started on the ending horrific  see it if you read the book and have to watch it come to life on film but trust me any other movie out in the last 5 years is better then this piece of junk sorry 50 shades fanatics its true
Feb 13 2015,positive,with its well shot cinematography and the sex everybody was thinking about fifty shades of grey is a surprising erotic drama and romance film which fulfills the book adaptation into the big screen with good performances by break out stars jamie dornan and especially our lead and sweet dakota johnson who gave it her all which gave charm and innocence to her character while the film turns out to be a  unique story with semi and functional chemistry everyone was waiting for
Feb 13 2015,positive,it was much better than i expected looking forward to the next one
Feb 13 2015,positive,i enjoyed the moviei cant wait for the second movie
Feb 13 2015,negative,the actors are boring on the screenno chemistry and the film is poorly written
Feb 13 2015,positive,this movie was great they really focused on the love between ana and christian it blew my mind the acting was also great especially from dakota johnson she really became ana and even made her better the screenplay was also very well written they kept a lot of the most famous lines from the book and added some really good ones too over all the movie was great and i cant wait to see it at least 5 more times
Feb 13 2015,negative,this movie was horriblei loved the booksthe acting was horrible the storyline was not even close to the book and most of all it was a real disappointment instead of portraying a dom christian portrayed an abuser
Feb 13 2015,negative,the best comedy ive seen all year
Feb 13 2015,negative,the worst pick for christian grey they could have picked im only give the movie this rating for the fact that it looked good and that the girl playing ana did well with the little she had to work with
Feb 13 2015,positive,truthful from someone who didnt want to see it its pretty good starts slow and very twilight likeunfortunately but pulls together halfway throughif the roles were switched and she was the dominant this movie would prob have double the ratings feminist infleuncemost everyone leaving the theater said they cant to see the sequel guess they are too ashamed to say it in public in fear of judgement
Feb 13 2015,negative,where is christian grey  i read the books and they did not appeal much to me but the movie lacked all the good of this story this movie shows a very weak christian that rapidly surrender himself to romantic feelings for anastasia the only thing i liked about the book is how messed up this guy is how reluctant he is about love on the movie he just seems to be an easy target no no
Feb 13 2015,positive,i honestly enjoyed fifty shades of grey i thought dakota and jamie did a wonderful job bringing these characters to the big screen and can not wait to see the next movie
Feb 13 2015,negative,oh good lord what a terrible movie i spent a good deal of it wondering if the decent production quality lifted it out of the showgirls ghetto of terrible films and decided no no it didnt i dont know why im surprised it only goes to follow that horrible writing would produce horrible acting i am surprised at the praise i read for dakota johnson i presume its really either winning by comparisonok she is better than jamie dornan but the bar is low she has four faces she can make and three of them are painful to watch this is a bad movie if you think watching a bad actor beat a bad actress will enflame you by all means go for it otherwise spare yourself the psychic pain and go and see something better you have been warned
Feb 13 2015,negative,this was the worst movie ever  it makes capote look like an action movie i would not even spend a 199 on red box when it comes out
Feb 13 2015,positive,when does the second part come out
Feb 13 2015,positive,i think fifty shades of grey could have been better they did so much work on the sex scenes that you lose a fair chunk of the banter and small things that make the story as popular as it is the   tortured brooding handsome and  outwardly confident inwardly vulnerable  male lead has lost some of his appeal i mean come on he is the bad boy the villain how is he going to win us over if we dont let him speak so we get to see his redeeming qualities  jamie dornan can do something better with this character if they let him the enuendo is there lets get some story development for the 2nd movie
Feb 13 2015,neutral,unfortunately the movie was not at all as what you might expected  the protagonist was more apologetic than controlling  lot of scenes reminded me of the type of audience you would expect for the twilight saga movies such as the scene where the guy is playing the piano without a shirt some scenes did have some implied eroticism and intrigue like the negotiation of the terms unfortunately this was not exploited  people expected fireworks and we got peanuts there was a big huff of disappointment from most people around me when the end titles showed up i guess we all remained hopeful that things were just going to start getting hotter  compare with less apologetic foreign movies like a ton of french history of o spain lucia y el sexo mexico y tu mama tambien
Feb 13 2015,positive,i was on the fence about seeing this until i sat in the theatre after seeing the finished product i can say im surprised both pleasantly and in the true sense the character i expected to be the best represented by the actor turned out to let me down and the one i expected to be a flat out failure managed to pull it off with flying colors the film also pushed the boundaries of what i expected to be severely watered down sex scenes to what barely made it rated r if it made me tense down there its not a complete waste of time bravo to the director half applause to the casting director go watch it and dont let people tell you what they think
Feb 13 2015,negative,it was awkward it conveyed very little emotion while the sex was there as promised the feeling behind it was not and although i wanted to love jamie dornan as christian grey i just didnt hes hot theres no question about it but he isnt christian grey however dakota johnson as anastasia steele was spot on i just wish that i could say better things about this movie but as previously stated it just felt awkward
Feb 13 2015,negative,50 shades of stupid
Feb 13 2015,positive,read the books and was not disappointed of course the pace of the movie seemed much faster but thats usually what happens great comedic moments and amazing chemistry from the main characters but for me the star of the movie was the music what an amazing soundtrack especially beyonces new arrangement of crazy in love that was hot
Feb 13 2015,negative,even with its sexual nature the ultimate climax is the credits 50  shades of grey is overlong  unexciting  and tediousas well as acting as bad as a actual porn 
Feb 13 2015,positive,i didnt think it was as bad as everyone is making it out to me you kind of have to be open minded when going into it of course the book isnt going to be how you imagined because its your imagination everyone has a different perspective on how they envisioned this movie it seems i personally dont like jamie christian but i out that aside to just watch the movie you can tell there is a lot of problems going on and you could feel the wall christian put up like i said its not that bad
Feb 13 2015,negative,i just got back from 50 shades of gray and i expected to go into it and have fun at the movies expense i wanted to come out of it as if i had watched the worst movie ever in a fun and innocent way i dont feel that way now i feel disturbed and discomforted i wasnt discomforted or disturbed by the activities portrayed as those activities portrayed therein were vanilla no i was disturbed by the deeply problematic relationship dynamics between christian gray and anastasia steele that relationship wasnt a relationship based upon the loving precepts of bdsm that relationship was psychologically abusive and has a foundation built upon manipulation control and coercion christian gray is a sociopath and has a psychopathology that is comparable to ted bundy if you wish to go to that movie go to it and view it not as an erotic romance but as a horror film because if this were real life anastasia would have ended up at best with repeated trips to the hospital to fix facial injuries sustained in a fall or at worst butchered and encased in the concrete of the seahawks stadium anyway that is my serious appraisal of this movie end rant
Feb 13 2015,negative,if you read the books the movie will just frustrate you and piss you off anna was portrayed beautifully christian on the other hand emotionless tormented everything that left his mouth sounded like a cheap one liner catch phrase its a sad sad portrayal of a good book
Feb 13 2015,positive,it wasnt all that was expected
Feb 13 2015,negative,i read the books 3 times each im so disappointed at the movie not only sex scenes were awkward and lacked chemistry the scenes did not connect it was allover the place horrible
Feb 13 2015,negative,meh  the chemistry wasnt totally believableand the best moment in the movie happened at the very end when there was some believable emotion between christian and ana
Feb 13 2015,positive,i thought it was silly and the acting wasnt always good  but it was fun just fun  dont bring you guy go with girlfriends   its mistakenly marketed as a date movie it isnt
Feb 13 2015,negative,boring zero plot better sex scenes on porn sites characters not believable
Feb 13 2015,negative,this is 50 shits of grey i would rather watch turtles sex for 2 hours
Feb 13 2015,negative,the book sucked pretty bad im sure this will too
Feb 13 2015,positive,this movie was epic dakota johnson and jamie dornan were dynamite jamie dornan is christian grey
Feb 13 2015,positive,inception cliffhanger ending overbearing sexual themes and complex characters with messed up stories to tell  this move does omit a lot from the book but due to the length this detail i forgave  it contains a ton of cliches and tropes but the complexity and clarity of the move shine  this is not a movie for the feint hearted  there are powerful moments where you strongly feel bad for the 2 main characters and i wanted to cry at the end
Feb 13 2015,negative,as far as mr greys bdsm skills go its all actually quite black and white and someone hand anna an asthma pump
Feb 13 2015,negative,xx to slow and nothing happened
Feb 13 2015,positive,i dont know why people are giving such bad reviews it is not all about the sex this is not what the books are about it was a great movie im saddened that critics have to be all about the sex 
Feb 13 2015,positive,on my way to the movie theatre i expected this movie to be cheesy disappointed and completely terrible but i gotta to say it was by far one of the best movie ive seen it was sexy funny sad and did i mention sexy as soon as the movie finished there is not one person in the movie theatre that didnt say noooo i seriously think that every single person in there couldve watched the whole 3 books in one sitting 1 movie  2hours i am so so so happy i watched it and i cannot wait wait for the other two i will definitely be watching this movie again and again completely satisfied
Feb 13 2015,negative,definitely a let down i never expect a movie to be as good as a book but this was pretty bad where was the passion and heat it was very awkward and forced
Feb 13 2015,positive,im not sure why the reviews for this movie have been so harsh i saw it today and loved it i read all of the books and honestly after book 2 found myself desperately wanted the pain to end i honestly didnt expect much from the movie but was pleasantly surprised i took my husband whom has read none of the books and kicked and screamed til the lights went dim in the theater but not a complaint out of him during the entire movie and after it he gave 2 thumbs up which is a shocker cause he hates chick flicks i loved who they chose for anastasia she was sweet funny innocent and perfect for the role and her rocking hot body made it all the better butt double idk but wow christian had to grow on me i pictured eric scarsgard while reading lol but that only took 2030min because he as well is eyecandy all the way and played his dominating role quite nicely i thought the sex scenes were nicely done they were intense steamy but also classy not trashy no monsters ball scenes here folks and left the audience wanting a bit more if i had to say something negative about it it would only be that it moved along really quick and left out a lot of details but what booktomovies dont right i felt nothing important was left out only small annoying details which was aok with me i loved the movie dont be haters it was 10x better than the first 2 books looking fw to the sequel go see it its worth it 
Feb 13 2015,neutral,it could have been better you know
Feb 13 2015,positive,i love the book i thought the movie was great too it is setting in motion what is coming next i just wish it was longer
Feb 13 2015,positive,i loved it im a huge fan and very pleased with the movie i cant wait for the other two
Feb 13 2015,neutral,its hard to be ignorant of the publishing phenomenon that is 50 shades of grey by el james the erotic trilogy became notorious for its numerous and often outrageous sex scenes i have many female friends and relatives who read the series and while not a one will admit to finding the series ostensibly good they each read every book in a way it reminds me of another popular yet critically maligned romantic series  twilight it should be no coincidence then that grey began its early life as twilight fan fiction the movie adaptation was a hotly followed topic after all people argued how could it possibly be rated r how could you adapt it to the screen with a female director sam taylorjohnson wife to actor aaron taylorjohnson and a female screenwriter kelly marcel to steer the adaptation process i figured i would at least get a sense of exactly what was so uncontrollably appealing about the series for a film designed to be titillating and provocative i came away wishing it had more action of any sort because the movie was just so freaking boring    anna dakota johnson subs for her sick roommate and gets to interview playboy billionaire christian grey jamie dornan he takes an interest in her innocence and so he runs into her at the hardware store where she works he fetches her after a drunken text on her part and whisks her away to his luxurious seattle highrise before things can get frisky he has to share a secret hes a dominant looking the world over for women who are willing to submit to him and be his submissive the world of sadomasochism is a new one for anna a 22yearold on the verge of graduating college however shes drawn to christian and accepts his terms and thats when the sex gets taken to another level    so much of the film is the drawn out flirtation between two characters that i found painfully uninteresting wasnt this supposed to be the exciting and sexy story of risqué sex and overpowering urges im by no means the target demographic but i felt unmoved by the onscreen sex because it was so sedate by hollywood standards ive seen more enthusiastic and engaging sex scenes skimming the channels of latenight cable tv it certainly doesnt even come close to rivaling some of the steamier sequences of films past like 9  12 weeks the dreamers henry  june last tango in paris the piano risky business sex and lucia dont look now y tu mama tambien dangerous liaisons sex lies and videotape little children mullholland drive and secretary for fans of romance with bdsm please give 2002s secretary a chance since it is 500 shades superior to el james    i understand that most erotic tv series and films are readily designed for men and 50 shades was designed for women and there are differences in approach and stimulation but for a product that is famous for the degree of kink involved i was sorely disappointed by the results in short the movie needs more kink it plays out as an introductory guide to bondage and sm this aspect isnt even explored until the very end its too timid to really give in to the thrills of its premise and likewise the demand of its readership theres a lot of nudity mostly from johnson but the sex scenes themselves are rather ordinary and sedate all things considered there are four of them in total for those curious readers wishing to keep track i also tried keeping track of the times anna bit her lower lip but lost count the sex scenes are filled with plenty of moaning but not a one of them builds up to climax a strange omission since were tracking annas pleasures i wasnt expecting the graphic and graphically drawn out onscreen sex of blue is the warmest color but i was certainly expecting more after all the hubbub in the end a sexy movie is going to be known for its sexy scenes which may or may not include sex i feel like fans are going to be justifiably irked by the absence of fullfrontal male nudity  come on give the fans a bone here 50 shades of grey is ironically far too tepid to register as much more than subsoft core eroticism    then there are the characters both of which are too onedimensional and also boring to bring much interest cinema has always been interested in goodlooking people getting it on but unless theres careful attention to plot and character then youre just recycling the same soft core setups it is wholly transparent that james novel began as twilight fan fiction because the couple occupies the same unhealthy relationship roles the female lead is a standin for the audiencereaders shes a mousey shy normal girl who gets swept away by a brooding and dangerous man who tells her hes no good insists she should not be with him but cannot help himself falling for her because he sees her inner beauty hes more male chauvinist than complex character and his obsession is less a sign of a tortured psyche and more as displayed a clear indication of a sexual predator anybody who requires his paramours to sign legal documents about what he can put inside them seems like somebody not worth knowing he tracks her down across the country when she dares to see her mother because anna didnt ask his permission control freak or a budding sociopath with a lack of tawdry sex scenes the far majority of the film is anna and christian ramping up their almost endless sexual tension which the movie will hit you over the head with i didnt feel a single thing between the two of them partly because of how poorly written they are and also because of the lack of chemistry we watch her bite her lip a thousand times we watch her stammer we watch him stare rather intently like a shark the filmmakers are doing the work for us rather than allowing a romance to blossom organically its cajoled and manipulated and feels inauthentic in every sense even before the trip to the playroom begins     there is one standout scene that is actually sexy and apparently its quite different from the source material as anna and christian go over his legal language for his submissive they treat it as a business meeting with an arch sense of professionalism its one of the few times anna displays a spark of personality as well as decisionmaking as she goes line by line and says what she will and will not do its played with a wry sense of humor but theres also a sexy undercurrent throughout the scene where these two adults are having fun with the preliminaries if the rest of 50 shades of grey had this same sense of personality and fun it might have worked as an engrossing erotic fantasy     johnson need for speed is an enjoyable screen presence even if theres absolutely nothing interesting about her character anna is so absent a personality that it makes it easier for the story to present someone else doing all the work for her pushing her prodding her giving her form johnson plays a lot of scenes for laughs which work in a tittergenerating way i kept hearing patricia arquettes voice whenever she spoke but i may be alone in this unusual observation dornan tvs the fall on the other hand is terribly wooden again hes playing a rather terrible character with rather terrible dialogue but its hard to feel any authentic sense of passion from the guy its hard to say whether these actors are miscast or whether there could ever possibly be a suitable matching because of how lacking the simplistic characters are theyre archetypes and ones the movie has to keep persuading you are totally hot for one another     so what is it that makes this property the wouldbe blockbuster that it is the story arc has been done before for decades going all the way back to rudolph valentinos son of the sheik the mysterious prince who comes and sweeps the princess of her feet to his exotic world of privilege 50 shades isnt reinventing the wheel but it has struck a chord and perhaps its the wish fulfillment angle the introductory angle to a world of bdsm or the plain jane ordinary heroine that acts as a cipher for readership the books are the books and the movie must be judged on its own account im sure most of the series fans will be pleased one way or another though i doubt many of them will find the movie an improvement over the book then again it does strip away james wretchedly torrid writing if it wasnt for the 100 million books sold worldwide this movie wouldnt be generating any of the hype it is but is that the films fault the hype machine unfairly builds expectations that will fail to be met but then again its the oversaturated exposure that has ensured 50 shades of being a valentines weekend event for half the planet     surprisingly boring and rather tepid 50 shades of grey feels too callow to be the provocative film experience it wants to be it needs more of just about everything more characterization more organic coupling more story more romance more kink it is lacking in too many areas though the production values are sleek like its the most technically accomplished episode of red shoe diaries its a tedious story of the hazards and joys of giving up control but i didnt care about the characters i need more than pretty people staring at each other for an hour while a breathy remix of a beyonce son plays over the scene to be fair that beyonce remix is hot the actors dont connect together and the christian character comes across as more of a monotone jerk than wounded bad boy im sure 50 shades has pushed millions into exploring aspects of their own sex lives they would not have felt comfortable exploring beforehand and good for them my friend angie quipped that if nothing else the release of 50 shades of grey will cause a spike in battery sales for its opening weekend its a shame then that the movie is too limp where it counts to be serviceable     nates grade c
Feb 13 2015,positive,just came back from watching the movie i loved it stayed true to the 1st book  acting  chemistry was great
Feb 13 2015,negative,i went to see this movies with hopes of these actors portraying these character we understood them from the books dornan could not deliver a powerful experienced dominate alpha male some of the quotes spoken from him had fallen flat along with the lack of chemistry johnson portrayal of anastasia was exactly the way the character was to be understooda virgin exploring unknown territory the story lacked a plot and was dragging it started to pick up at the endleft the cinema disappointed that i spent 2 hrs watching an introduction to the movie
Feb 13 2015,negative,this movie was a bore they did nothing to attempt to fill in the narrations in the book so every part that anastasia is thinking describing etc is left as blank odd silence in the movieit was almost like an audio book on screenminus the narrator of coursethats the best way i can describe itawful
Feb 13 2015,negative,awful ending not enough scenes with so call sex
Feb 13 2015,negative,fifty shades of boredom
Feb 13 2015,negative,honestly if you ever wondered what film critic to follow as theres so many after watching this i would definitely narrow it down to the ones that gave it a poor rating i cannot understand for 1 minute how this got any positive feedback im sure christian grey was played by a jamie theakston lookalike watch i though and youll understand why i made the first comment
Feb 13 2015,negative,the movie was terribly flacid
Feb 13 2015,positive,it keep to the book as best to its ability and i have read that series quiet a few times its very well executed and the characters were well chosen i cant believe i have to wait another year for the next one
Feb 13 2015,negative,not worth the time stick with the books
Feb 13 2015,negative,okay one of the problems with the movie is that there is no 9gag  where the fuck are my fresh memes  another is that the 9gag army doesnt arrive  we love 9gag  this movie need more 9gag  fuck you all
Feb 13 2015,negative,the only safe word you need is fire  yell that in the movie theater and stop the torture of those in the seats next to you
Feb 13 2015,negative,2 stars    this film was incredibly hyped up after reading the books i knew a film like this wouldnt live up to the expectations i had  the film was below average with below average acting from dakota johnson who they definitely shouldnt of cast as anastasia jamie dornan is beautiful but just a little too cringey for my taste the film also missed out vital parts of the book   dakota johnson and jamie dornan had absolutely no on screen chemistry i honestly felt awkward watching it at times like it was forced and at some points i genuinely felt creeped out     if youve read the book dont bother seeing this film totally unimpressed
Feb 13 2015,negative,i just didnt see any chemistry between the two leading roles most of the women in the theater were loud and obnoxious it was a skinamax flick with a bit better acting the actress that plays ana really didnt do it for me i read a little from each book and literary version plays better in my minds eye than it did on the big screen i must admit that i wasnt looking forward to watching this movie so i went in with my eyes wide shut
Feb 13 2015,negative,all hype no story to it
Feb 13 2015,positive,this in my opinion has been one of the best book to movie adaptations ive seen in a long time jamie and dakota really brought the characters alive and sam taylorjohnson stayed very true to the story the sex scenes were toned down but in the most tasteful way i know that everyone is mad because their favorite actor or actress didnt get chosen to be christian and ana but they need to realize that everyone has their own vision on who they were i mean the book started out as twilight fanfic so be glad robert pattinson wasnt christian
Feb 13 2015,positive,loved it 
Feb 13 2015,positive,i loved this lived upto its expectations 100 if you enjoyed the book then youll like this too roll on the next film 
Feb 13 2015,positive,not enough important dialogue included from the book  just a bunch of scenes patched together  anastasias part was played well  but the entire movie should have been different  maybe a narrative with steeles voice  it wasnt good very disappointing
Feb 13 2015,negative,not worth seeing this sadistic drivel
Feb 13 2015,positive,really good movie i didnt care for the choice of lead roles before seeing the movie however i was pleasantly surprised d
Feb 13 2015,positive,enjoyed the movie and a must see  steamy
Feb 13 2015,negative,even though i liked the cinematography and soundtrack the film itself has many problems and they can easily be seen
Feb 13 2015,positive,just finished watching fifty shades of grey and i gotta say the film was beautiful yes i am using the word beautiful to describe this movie i went into the theater completely prepared to be embarrassed because of how graphic it was supposed to be but i was extremely surprised by how i actually felt i watched all of the scenes that were made available and thought that it all seemed a bit awkward but it was only because there was no background music or noise watching the actual scenes in the movie was a whole other experience   the movie is getting a really bad rep because of the bad writing and graphic scenes that are in the book that it is based on however the movie is not just a sex movie like everyone says its pretty hilarious and romantic the sex scenes were extremely dialed down and they all served a purpose if you thought the pointless sex in the wolf of wall street was acceptable then you would be more than okay with the content in this fifty shades before i watched fifty shades of grey i watched a lot of interviews with the cast of the film and was confused as to how they could possibly describe the sex scenes as being classy and elegant but then again all i had to compare it to were scenes from game of thrones true blood the wolf of wall street etc after watching this film i can honestly say that i completely agree with the cast there was nothing dirty or wrong about what i was seeing on the screen sam taylorjohnson the director did an excellent job with this movie she made it very tasteful and easier to accept this film could have gone in a very bad direction but thank god it didnt   for those of you that think that this movie is glorifying abusive relationships think again because i think that it actually empowers women im sure that you can argue with quotes from the book that im wrong but there are many differences between the film and the book let me remind all of you that the book is a little over 500 pages and the movie is only about 2 hours long obviously they had to cut a lot of things out including the blue string scene that im sure a lot of people are aware of in my opinion they cut out many of the scenes that were considered controversial i watched the movie looking for signs of an abusive relationship but i really didnt see anything of that nature in fact all i saw was this confident and empowered woman that made all of her own decisions she was not forced to do anything that she didnt want to do she wanted to explore christians dark world and her own sexuality you can argue that christian abuses her physically and emotionally but he does what she tells him to do when she says stop he stops when she says that she wants more he tries to give her more   moving on to something lighter the comedy in this movie is on point there were many laughoutloud moments that gave the movie a lighter mood those scenes were there to show that christian and anas relationship was not all dark and serious i mean they are both young people in their twenties that should be having fun  dakota johnson gave a phenomenal performance and did everything right she was confident awkward shy and funny all at the same time jamie dornan also did an amazing job as christian grey they had great chemistry  i guess what im trying to say is that you should give the movie a chance if you hate the book it doesnt necessarily mean that you will hate the movie i have read many reviews written by skeptics saying that they ended up loving it dont let the bad reviews or even the book itself stop you from seeing the movie i was not disappointed at all with the finished product even though they cut out a few scenes that i loved it is perfect just the way it is   i apologize for any grammatical mistakes unlike ms steele i am not an english major
Feb 13 2015,negative,a romance that is not even romantica romance that is not an actual romancethis whole story and plot does not quite work as a real storythere is not an actual development neither of the characters nor of the storyand there is no meaning under all of thisit is just a sight for the eyes and that was just a poor sightit was actually as i was expecting it to bewith grey as the gorgeous protagonist and anna as the young submissive girlcliche lines and really boring dialogues compose the greatest part of the moviea movie everyone will want to watch cause its promotion is intriguingbut everyone will forget about sooner or lateri just hope it does not become a blockbuster of great numbers
Feb 13 2015,negative,very exaggerated and dramatic for a soft core porn movie
Feb 13 2015,positive,they stuck to the book really well i know thats usually the biggest complaint with the book readers
Feb 13 2015,positive,i went to see this to see how badly they messed it up and was very pleased with the job they did go see it
Feb 13 2015,positive,yes im going to like it  dakota johnson was worth the ticket price  i have no shame admitting i have indecent thoughts about jamie dornan  i love sam taylorjohnson so all my cards are on the table  i enjoyed the film part of this movie and i think everyone got those parts right  so how about the sex  its not boring but theres way too much of it and its not particularly interesting  im not a prude and i sort of skimmed the book  so if youre a book lover i probably dont have your same perspective  everyone involved was trying so hard to make the sex sexy that it looked like everyone was trying hard  werent they supposed to be having fun  too much writhing just enough thrusting but not much joy  poor jamie dornan in this regard  you can tell hes comfortable enough with sex but the violence doesnt suit him  one final gripe shes naked too much in the movie  who thought that was sexy  im not opposed to porn just for the record  good porn is an equal opportunity proposition
Feb 13 2015,positive,jamie dornan  need i say more   the movie was well done  i liked it better than the book  dakota johnson played a stronger anna  thank goodness than the   portrayed  she was smart strong and brave i loved her    jamie dornan softened christians characteragain i thought it was for the better  he was very likable as well    critics are ragging on the sex scenes snd saying they are not true s and mi say thank goodness because im not a hard core s and m fan  scenes were more kinky than cruel  the finale is well done and intenseit left me screaming for more   overall i say worth seeing it on the big screen
Feb 13 2015,negative,this film shouldve just been nc17 and maybe ive wouldve stayed in the theater but i left early because its just not for me i didnt like the book so i shouldve known i wouldnt like the movie theres just nothing about it appealing
Feb 13 2015,positive,left me wanting more just like the books seductive and sadly underwhelming just like the books
Feb 13 2015,positive,i think that it is interesting that most of the critics posted are men this movie is not for you it is to get your female partners ready for you when you cant quite do it be a good boy and go to the movie with your significant other then when she has drooledamong other things related to moisture all over the movie theater chairs go  her for as long as you can hold up
Feb 13 2015,positive,what people dont understand is that this was not a movie made for critics it was solely made for fans of the books that being said this movie was so amazingly done i was not sure what to expect from johnson and dornan but i was extremely impressed by how well they portrayed these characters the next to movies cant come soon enough
Feb 13 2015,positive,if people dont like itdont watch itenjoyed the books and loved the movieofcourse the book is always better than the movie
Feb 13 2015,positive,was alright seen more sex in game of thrones and discuss dirtier situations around the lunch table every day
Feb 13 2015,positive,fifty shades of grey is passionate entertaining and seductive from start to finish   his pace is beneficial and dynamic the chemistry between dakota johnson y jamie dornan is extremely emotional and functional
Feb 13 2015,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and the performances by the leads  so why all the negatives reviews  as far as the critics i think they want to dislike this movie  it is inconvenient and not politically correct  many of the public critics have either not read the book admittedly pulp fiction or do not get the story grey gave her safe words but she chose not to use them in the end we find out why in book 2 dakota johnson did a good job of portraying the movement from innocent to enlightened controlled to in control  critics of dornans performance ignore that he is portraying a person of controlled and confused emotion  they mistake that for lack of emotion  that pours out in book 2 also   it is unfortunate that this exploration of bdsm as timid as it is seems to send everyone scurrying with fingers in their mouths  the movie is better than what it has been characterized as and i look forward to the second movie which may now not ever see the light of day  that would be too bad because there is the love story
Feb 13 2015,negative,contrary to popular belief it is not the worst film ever its not even terrible but its not erotic its not interesting and the acting is truly crap el james had far too much creative control the subject matter doesnt allow for much intelligence but it didnt have to be this boring
Feb 13 2015,positive,uneven movie when it worksits fascinating when it doesntits flat dakota johnson and jaime dornan seem perfectly cast they both do a great job johnson is especially good the movies problem is its dialoguemost of it anyway what comes out of their mouths is wildly different than what their expressions and bodylanguage prepare us forthey say routine stuff when we expect them to say things that are insightful clever i didnt read the book perhaps the book has the same problem i will say this i do intend to see the next movie in this series when it comes out
Feb 13 2015,positive,the story line followed the book pretty well  i liked the movie and thought it was good  if you liked the book  you will like the movie
Feb 13 2015,negative,most disappointing film in decades dont watch especially if you enjoyed the books baaaad film great marketing
Feb 13 2015,negative,as predicted this film is pants  dont expect much
Feb 13 2015,negative,no one could save this book its a fanfic that should of stayed in the bowls of the internet its not real bdsm its abuse pretending to be bdsm no amount of lighting or rewrites could change that its not even hot its white bread no personality other than abuser gary mcstu with miss im a worse written bella swan mary sue  if you want to make me blush give me characters i wouldnt want to run over with a truck even the stars that arein the movie hate it  the dude playing mrgrey took long ass showers before he even touched his wife the movie is that bad im not even kidding he said that
Feb 13 2015,positive,i enjoyed it some differences from the book but thats too be expected  looking forward to darker
Feb 13 2015,negative,a stupid movie for dried up old prunes in menopause
Feb 13 2015,negative,one of the worst movies ever made cant believe the script would be so empty and sex could be so boring the much hyped steamy sex scenes are neither passionate nor sleazy after watching it couple of times you would start wondering not again when they start undressing    its just waste of time in even trying to write a review for this shit
Feb 13 2015,positive,i would give this movie 3 stars but because of all those annoying people out there who dont want to see the movie because they think its all about abuse but give it a bad rating anyway or maybe they secretly like the movie went to see it but too embarrassed to give it a decent rating so they trashed the review i feel like i need to give it four stars just to make up for those annoying reviews  it was a well done movie i wasnt expecting it to be something incredible but i didnt think it was horrible either  it was entertaining and it stayed true to the book  there were lots of awkward moments in the book and i thought the actors did a very good job at making such awkward moments less awkward to watch  and thank you for not doing the tampon scene i still like jamie dornan better in the fall as a serial killer  it feels a little weird seeing him as someone romantic  only that last scene when he hit her that it really brought out his best look of a serial killer  the sex scenes were awkward i was hoping for something like the back scratching scene in basic instinct but what i saw just left me scratching my head thinking what she gets turned on that easily he hasnt even done anything  but the romance was cute to watch the drunk calling scene was funny  overall it was a 3 stars movies
Feb 13 2015,positive,i honestly did not expect to like the movie as much as i did i couldnt stop smiling from beginning to end i thought that sam taylor johnson did the movie with taste and glamour i felt like i was reading the book all over again its just a fun movie nothing to take too seriously
Feb 13 2015,positive,i truly enjoyed it if you read the book it ends in a cliff hanger just like the movie did the book is just the same way as the movie to many people either wanted to see more sex which would have made it a porno or less then what would have been the point of the movie  i liked it and cant wait until the next one
Feb 13 2015,positive,i think the casting was perfect they all fit their roles perfectly im glad it wasnt too hardcore porn because im sure it wouldve been too much and almost gross to see that on a movie of course it wasnt exactly like the book and although they did skip some parts they kept a lot of good scenes and it was almost what i imagined when i read the book i could see why there are so many critics but this was altogether a really good film never expect too much from a movie that is based on a book still got my panties wet tho lmao
Feb 13 2015,positive,definitely a must watch movie might not be for everyone but i thought it was very interesting every scene had us staying interested
Feb 13 2015,positive,dakota johnson was perfectly cast and does an excellent job  a nice romance that pretty well follows the book  sex scenes are not as steamy as the book ones were  worth seeing
Feb 13 2015,positive,awesome movie   true to the book  done very tastefulloved it
Feb 13 2015,negative,this was apparently a film with a budget a script and some actors  that is the kindest thing i can say about it    on the other hand if disney made a liveaction film about bdsm i imagine it would be a lot like this  and im sure that for some that is worth the price of admission
Feb 13 2015,positive,i really wasnt sure what i was expecting from a dire book and the other 2 are even worse but the movie is was somewhat of a suprise and i liked it alot mainly because dakota who plays ana is really good and her character is slightly different a littler feistier and spunky doran is more unsuccessful as he is stiffer yes its not really sexy and the 2 leads have 0 chemistry but see it with an open mind and  you will be suprised
Feb 13 2015,negative,stupidest and most pointless movie ever it is a huge waste of time and a huge waste of money this movie shouldnt have existed in the first place due to how stupid and lame it is
Feb 13 2015,negative,absolutely rubbish dont waste time or money
Feb 13 2015,positive,take it what its for and you will love it that endingleaves me wanting more looking forward to the next one
Feb 13 2015,positive,great movie stayed true to the book like every movie thats based on a book the book is better and has a lot more descriptions and scenes but i understand that movies cant be like 6 hours long  i dont know if people who have previously rated it have actually see it or are just haters
Feb 13 2015,positive,fifty shades of grey is a beautifully shot film in fact the cinematography is just excellent the acting from all the cast is great but dakota johnson definitely shines as anastasia and jamie dornan is a stoic christian this is a film that will gather a lot of scrutiny but i honestly dont think it deserves any of that criticism the biggest stand out is how faithful to the source material it is like many film adaptations they often fall flat because they deviate from whats actually suppose to happen but not this film this is about as accurate as the lord of the rings trilogy in truth i prefer the books because of the total imagination it gives you but then again you can now rest aside your imagination and delve into the real thing
Feb 13 2015,positive,this movie was not what i expected i came in with the mentality of thinking this movie would be ehhhh okay but it was actually quite entertaining i laughed more than anything the sex scenes were more than rated r but not as sexual as the book i would recommend viewers to watch his movie with an open mind if you loved twilight this is an adult version of that
Feb 13 2015,negative,the movie not only cast the wrong person for christian grey but they lost the story
Feb 13 2015,negative,this movie is atrocious beyond words and the first movie from which ive ever walked out an hour and 17 minutes into it the session was full of giggling middleaged women wetting themselves with anticipation  i cannot believe this book and movie has appeal are women really so bored so desperate that this is what gets them off the acting was appalling  i guess thats the end of ms johnson  mr dornans careers and i wouldnt be surprised if the actors who refused the role of christian grey are secretly relieved they had the sense to reject it the script was laughable no chemistry between the two leads as for the eroticismit was completely lacking stilted awkward poor cinematography cheesy scripting just terrible
Feb 13 2015,positive,difficult to make this movie as erotic as the book and keep it r would have liked a different leading man
Feb 13 2015,negative,in need of better screenplay and better actors in the sequelplease sir
Feb 13 2015,positive,it was a lot like the book and if you do not like the book or never read it because it not your type you will not like it i dont think the guy who played christian grey was a perfect pick but he does a good job 
Feb 13 2015,negative,the movie was pretty flat and weak kinda like the book huh the chemistry bt christian and ana just wasnt there sorry but i cant recommend
Feb 13 2015,positive,i enjoyed it very muchvery sensual and it followed the book fairly well
Feb 13 2015,negative,better than i was expecting but the book must be awful incredibly smallminded towards a sexual world the author clearly knows nothing about and promoting the idea that anything other than missionary will be fun but you must have something wrong with you to make you want to do that in the first place and while the people end up the way they should end up there are sequels meaning that this girl has learned absolutely nothing the positives are that dakota johnson was able to make believable some seriously terrible moments and while initially flat the character slowly becomes a girl you feel like you could know and have a real conversation with hopefully her career will keep moving after this
Feb 13 2015,negative,this movie was completely flat there were ladies sleeping three quarters into the movie save your money and wait for it to come out on red box to be disappointed with how much you paid to see
Feb 13 2015,neutral,save your money and wait until it comes out on dvd its really not that great lol
Feb 13 2015,positive,i wasnt expecting to like it as much as i did dakota totally won me over  the audience laughed out loud at quite a few places very enjoyable movie
Feb 13 2015,positive,hot sexy  dornan surprisingly sexy but weak story line the book was definitely more explicit ended way too soon very disappointing ending left you wanting more
Feb 13 2015,positive,loved the movie cant wait for the next one
Feb 13 2015,positive,the build up is seductive needless to say the end will have you biting your lip i tuck pleasure in the actors characters details directing was it a yellow or a red go see it and youll find out
Feb 13 2015,negative,boring beyond belief i believe the only purpose of this movie is titillation but even with that limited scope it fails miserably as i feel only teenagers with raging hormones would buy into it  its terribly immature and simplistic and im guessing will only appeal to twilight fans
Feb 13 2015,positive,very different from the book however i still loved it cannot wait for the next one
Feb 13 2015,positive,fantastic from start to finish
Feb 13 2015,negative,just say no made for cinemax 3 am horrible
Feb 13 2015,negative,would seem lame for people who have not read the novels but drags for those of us who have  definitely not casted correctly  i kept seeing a younger but just as annoying version of melanie griffen as anna and really wished ian had been given the role of christian as much as i loved charlie in sons im wondering who could have ever seen him as christian  after all the anticipation  50 shades could have been and should have been so much better
Feb 13 2015,negative,i was expecting moresex i guess or at least to see pure passion btw them but i didnt appreciate the guarantee that there will be more movies to come i think they forgot this was a movie and not the book hence the ending
Feb 13 2015,negative,embarrassing disastrous dull and wrong the worst movie of the decade
Feb 13 2015,negative,who wants to pay to see dressedup porn in a theater  maybe on dvd
Feb 13 2015,negative,poorly made boring forgettable and acting so bad it is hilarious  the two leads both have all the sex appeal of sweat socks couldnt generate heat if you gave them a gallon of gasoline and a match
Feb 13 2015,negative,as someone who enjoyed reading the books mostly because of the relationship between grey  steele and how it develops i really wanted to enjoy this movie but it was such a letdown it was not directed well at all the whole movie felt really really rushed dornan lacked intensity and came across like he had not acted before he just wasnt believable the whole movie lacked emotion some scenes were almost like an snl skit i laughed at times when i shouldnt have have been laughing best part of the movie was dakota johnson i thought she was wonderful and believable she stole the movie loved her
Feb 13 2015,negative,booooring if i wanted porn i can get much better on the interwebs  or so ive heard
Feb 13 2015,negative,i was just reading the reviews for fsog and im wondering if some of these people were watching the same movie i saw  the lack if chemistry really hurt the movie  the overblown and badly overacted excitement on dakotas part was just sad  the casting wth did they even read the description of the characters leliot mia kate jose were nothing like described in the book not even close and mia just looked weird not sure what happened there   i wasnt a fan of jamie christian but i wouldve walked out of the theater if he hadnt done such a good job   i do however feel that if you havent read the books that this will seem to you that the theme of the books is abusive porn i think you need the inner monologs you can only get in the books     omg and i almost forgot the worst part the textingim messages were shown in caption boxes on screen like in nonstop  really   not trying to discourage anyone here if youre a fan of the trilogy then see it just dont go somewhere expensive
Feb 13 2015,positive,i loved it it was very close to the book which i read more than once it was great i already want to watch it again    yes a lot of scenes didnt make the film but its to be expected
Feb 13 2015,negative,50 shades of dogshit
Feb 13 2015,negative,absolutely terrible simpleas
Feb 13 2015,negative,lets be honest here this movie never had a chance people were excited to see this movie before a single marketing frame was released for one reason to make fun of it   i guess i can see why the book its based on became a publishing phenomenon and even as people were buying themselves and their friends a copy they were lambasting it   i didnt read the book but from what i understand its poorly written actually from what i understand thats an understatement still people read it why curiosity perhaps a way to feel kinky without feeling socially unacceptable it obviously spoke to something rooted within the collective subconscious everyone has sexual quirks about them things that turn them on that they wouldnt want many other people to know im sure theres more than a few people out there for whom pain equals pleasure   or it could just be that in this social network addicted day and age where you can keep tabs on the people in your life as often and easy as looking at your phone they didnt want to feel left out if youre in a group of three and two of them have read the book and you havent thats a shitty feeling you want to be in on the joke in on the conversation     that certainly seems to be the case for the movie as well as of this writing fifty shades of grey holds a paltry 26 rating on rottentomatoes people go to see it knowing its going to be bad they pay for the movie ticket the overpriced concession snacks deal with the crowds and the sticky floors and the lack of parking to see a movie they know will be bad   even in the showing i went to the snickering started in the first scene and lasted until the last some of the that was nervous laughter immature people going to see a naughty movie and acting like a group of teenagers who just stumbled across their first porno mag giggling at the sight of bums and pulsating bodies giggling louder the steamier the scenes got grow up too bad the theatres dont enforce a mandatory maturity rating along with the age one     but people are going to see the movie in droves in many cases pretending to see it only for a laugh but in actuality seeing it for the same reason they read the book the subject matter so how does the movie handle its somewhat taboo content well considering i just referred to it as somewhat taboo perhaps not as bravely as it couldve or shouldve   again i didnt read the book if someone tells me a book sucks im not going to bother with it i dont care how many conversations that leaves me out of but i get the gist   and as far as this movie is concerned it feels a little watered down thats not to say it doesnt earn its r rating 18a in canada but it feels like when the steamy stuff just starts to get good and steamy they abruptly cut to the next scene this is probably to maintain the rating ive no doubt when the movie hits home release it will do so with an uncut version you couldnt see in theatres but still people are here to see some action   there also arent a whole lot of steamy scenes and the non steamy scenes arent interesting enough to justify that     a lot has been made of the lack of chemistry between the two mostly unknown lead actors in the film i dont know if its chemistry they lack more so than the ability to act i know that jaimie dornan who plays christian grey wasnt in the least bit convincing as a young billionaire control freak with a dark past and strange desires dakota johnson as anastasia isnt bad though she does well with the initially annoying but appropriate mix of innocent wide eyed wonder coupled with an addiction to this new and exciting man and the passion he sparks in her   is that to say the movie wouldnt have been hotter with two established sexy young stars in the role no it wouldve give me ryan gosling and blake lively any damn day but it is what it is man i love that saying dont you     my biggest problem with this film isnt the acting or the sexual cowardice its the ending all in all i felt that the film wasnt as bad as people were making it out to be it is an interesting story aside from a few unforgivably cheesy lines of dialogue im sure were transplanted from the book it wasnt terribly written and it has its moments of genuine humour danger and passion but it didnt go anywhere it ultimately feels unfinished it felt like it was building up to something for two hours and then the filmmakers just forgot to slap an ending on it its a sopranos style ending that makes you scratch your head when the end credits pop up unfortunately this sort of ending makes everything that came before it more or less pointless it wouldve made more sense if this movie was called fifty shades of grey part 1 and while i have no doubt there will be a sequel the feeling walking out of the theatre is not one of passions ignited or kinky itches scratched or even the aftertaste of delicious chemical coated popcorn its one of frustration of annoyance of a hard spanking the bad kind not the good kind
Feb 13 2015,positive,it wasnt as bad as i thought it was going to be the whole movie was awkward dakota johnson had no idea how to actually show anas feeling about the bdsm relationship or how weird christian acts the only parts that didnt seem awkward were the sex scenes they were then most put together scenes in the whole movie there also wasnt any real conflict the actors had no chemisty on screen
Feb 13 2015,positive,this movie is great i am glad i watched it i dont know why people dont like itis it because you want to see more sex can i just say its not about the sex its about ana and her transformation as a woman who was a virgin and loss her innocence to a man who is indeed fucked up i think its really good there is some really funny scenes in it which is excellent oh and another thingana consents to it christian grey is not a rapist hes a sadist get it right
Feb 13 2015,positive,it was really good stayed true to the book fairly well and was tasteful yet provocative during the sex scenes
Feb 13 2015,positive,i enjoyed this movie quite a lot  i read the books and enjoyed the film  for those who try to make it out to be some social issue i dont know what to tell you  i think you know if a movie is for you or not  its as if some people review movies that they didnt actually go see but just knew they wouldnt like so they trash it  i live in montana and our first showing was sold out and a mixed audience of all ages and creeds and as we were leaving everyone was talking about how they were glad they didnt believe the reviews and came to see for themselves
Feb 13 2015,negative,way to go youve taken a ridiculous movie premise twilight created a over the top rape fanfic on it then decided to create pseudo porn for the public market way to go
Feb 13 2015,positive,i liked it if you read the books its worth the watch
Feb 13 2015,positive,i dont get why people are moaning that jamie dornan is stiff playing cj have they not read the book hes a billionaire who gets what he wants of course hes gonna have an air around him and that he is quite stiff in the book as well mine the punits not until book 2 cj starts to relax give the man a chance i cant wait to see it well done guys 3
Feb 13 2015,negative,this was poorly written  dakota johnson did an excellent job conveying her thoughts and feelings even with lackluster dialog  jamie dornan wasnt as successful but its difficult to hold that against him because his dialog was even more sparse      the movie ended setting up for a sequel like the books were unfortunately the books werent substantial enough to really support a trilogy and as movies there is even less content to support a sequel much less a trilogy  it would have been much better making one movie out of all three books    the only way they will come out with all three films assuming that is what is intended is if all the fan girls  boys really step up and see the movie frequently
Feb 13 2015,positive,amazingly played cant wait for 50 shades darker
Feb 13 2015,negative,new director needed for second movie no raw emotion this one fell flat
Feb 13 2015,negative,i thought this was a family movie and i took my two seven year old kidsboth are extremely savage with me i got extremely horny during the film and had to bust but there was no where to go other then the bag of popcorn i didnt realize that my kids were still eating it until about fifteen minutes later when they asked for more they liked the movie more then i did and thats why i giving it one star
Feb 13 2015,positive,bondage for dummies
Feb 13 2015,positive,in the beginning  it likes a lamb is fascinated with a hunter and a dialog is quite unnatural so maybe it isnt interesting story but after that  the dialog is more natural and there are some interesting points in the movie which arent the sex scenes but that are about a complexity of human mind and a limit of love  curiosity and finding a reason each performer did a good job
Feb 13 2015,positive,the movie was great it did not sway from the book much the only thing i didnt like is how the movie ended on a cliffhanger however it left you wanting more
Feb 13 2015,positive,it lacked pace particularly the first half so many things were missing that if they had tightened the pace they could have had in i love jamie dornan but he is definitely more menacing as paul spector in the fall he was also more passionate as the sheriff in once upon a time so hes got it in him  i hope they make the next installment more edgy it needed it
Feb 13 2015,negative,unfortunately it was really bad acting and no chemistry between the lead characters
Feb 13 2015,positive,i think this was done as best as it could have been considering they were sticking to an r  i think book fans will be pleased  dakota johnson played the innocent part really well and jamie dornan does good as christian  by the end of the movie you start to really like them both  i dont see this being as good for people who have not read the book  if you havent read the book the dialogue may appear lame and the connection between the two seems fastpaced since you cant read their minds
Feb 13 2015,negative,sick nasty porn that shouldnt be on the big screen
Feb 13 2015,negative,super disappointed with this movie
Feb 13 2015,negative,not my christian grey
Feb 13 2015,positive,this is the one movie that stays true to the book the pace is pick up some but still covers all the big moments huge cliff hanger ends on a huge note
Feb 13 2015,negative,i was extremely disappointed with this film i expected so much more
Feb 13 2015,negative,dont watch this movie
Feb 13 2015,positive,if you have read the book it will feel like someone of the scenes involving sex are great where as some of the scenes were they talk feel like a bit forced but they are definitely true to the book cause it would seem their lines come straight out of the book pages all in all a worthy porn film to watch cant wait for the next one
Feb 13 2015,positive,good movie with a great cast both dakota and jamie are perfect in their roles as ana and christian a funny and sexy film which felt too short i could have easily watched 40 more minutes go and see
Feb 13 2015,positive,i cant wait for the next one  other reviewers seem to be coming off as knit picking and not give the movie the credit its due the movie follows the book very well and its funny hearing all the women in the theater snicker at the scenes
Feb 13 2015,negative,my tastes in film are very singular and its not this seriously shit
Feb 13 2015,neutral,i felt so excited that a film was going to be made and ever since the cast had been chosen i was skeptical about it and it truly was for the right reasons the movie has no flow there really isnt a plot but just skips around from scene to scene definitely not impressed i could have waited to be on netflix
Feb 13 2015,negative,not sure what to say about the characters i movie was very fast paced the details in the book was needed to make the character of grey to come alive for anyone who read the book they know that a lot of scene where cut which kind of does not help to show the characters across to the audience     the lines were exact word for word from the book which does not translate well in movie i hope the director will note that for the next movie     i wish that jamie could have kept his accent i could not buy his american accent also please someone teach him how to walk     i am looking forward to the 2nd movie because the plot is much better than first
Feb 13 2015,negative,horrible ruined the book not worth watching not worth renting beyond disappointed maybe had a chance if it was nc17 but not sure i loved the books hate the movie
Feb 13 2015,negative,i totally get hot kinky sex love my husband and live to try new stuff not a huge fan of being submissive being told what to eat no thank you i was raised with 3 sisters and no brothers and to see a women so weak willed and easily manipulated its sad hated the books too but wanted to see what the movie would take out to make is socially acceptable turns out there wasnt much book left once you took out the porn
Feb 13 2015,positive,not too bad must admit
Feb 13 2015,negative,while it does flirt with being interesting at times its also poorly paced occasionally hokey and overlong but its biggest sin of all is that its simply not exciting  oh and come to think of it if i were a woman id be offended by its portrayal of anastasia steele  it basically depicts a onedimensional woman who cant be happy unless shes ruled and overpowered by a narcissistic man
Feb 13 2015,negative,so its hard to explain first the casting for the  characters they did put in  the movie was good i think they portrayed the characters well i think the  blame for my disappointment is totally with the screen writer andor the  editor they left out a pretty important character in the movie though mrs  jonesthey dont even show her or mention her either she was never written in or  they cut her out either way bad call also they did a very piss poor job of  showing how their relationship develops throughout even though they still have  christian saying youre the one whose changing me but that doesnt really  come across in the movie they dont sleep in the same bed except after the  first time and that really bugged me because that was one of the major ways you  could see how she affects and changes him in the books he was always  sleeping wrapped around her and saying even in sleep i cant stay away from  you also the story had no flow it jumped around a lot after he goes into  claytons after their interview at the beginning it just  jumped around a lot and there was zero flow between scenes example after he  leaves claytons it immediately jumps to the photo shoot and ana telling kate  that hes asked her to go for drinkscrazy the book was not well written to begin with and i really had hoped the movie would develop it because there was potential there but they completely failed i  dont know it was just all so poorly done like they rushed it so they could  get it out by valentines day
Feb 13 2015,negative,in my opinion the only good casting was anastisia dakota johnson mr grey was not sexy at all 
Feb 13 2015,negative,horrible totally horrible
Feb 13 2015,positive,they focused on the intimacy and intensity of ana and chrisitans relationship instead of making it well fluff which it really could have been instead of being this silly and corny it touched on what it is like to love someone who cant love you back the way you want them to they really protected the actors on this one there was substance and i felt went emotionally deeper than the books great acting great chemistry as well
Feb 13 2015,positive,i really liked the movie it followed the book really well and hit all the main and important parts i thought dakota johnson and jamie dornan did an excellent job acting in their roles there were funny intense and sometimes awkward parts but overall i thought it was really good
Feb 13 2015,negative,i did not buy the chemise of the lead actors which defeats the entire movie the picked the wrong expressionless actor to play christian he just constantly has an odd stare trying to portray the intensity of the character but fails if you loved the book go in with very low expectations in order not to be disappointed lots of scenes from the book where left out
Feb 13 2015,positive,the movie was great add it stayed true to the book a must see for any fan of the books
Feb 13 2015,positive,really well done not as good as the book but the soundtrack made it better
Feb 13 2015,negative,a terrible sleepinducing waste of a film viewers are treated to a drawn out story of a relationship developing between the male christian grey and female anastasia steele characters where they will become a couple indulging in bondage sex however there seems no reason for the relationship the two protagonists display zero chemistry towards one another have no common interests and grey spends most of the film stalking steele there are suggestions in the film that grey has hidden secrets in his past that have lead him to become cold and enjoy the inducement of pain but seemingly you wont get to know what they are unless you pay your entrance fee for another two sequels so what you get in this film is well nothing no explanation of greys past no attempts to explore his demons no attempts to make the movie a worthwhile experience its merely a multimillion dollar softporn film and if its trying to be shocking it fails miserably
Feb 13 2015,negative,wish i could of asked for a refund    first 30mins or so were funny the last portion of the movie felt like i was watching paint dry
Feb 13 2015,negative,fifty shades  by no means a master piece and not a great history
Feb 13 2015,negative,im a huge fan of the books and i knew the movie probably wouldnt do the books justice however this was horrible in an effort to fit everything into two hours they rewrote many of the scenes from the book they made the movie very choppy skipping from scene to scene the love story was lost and the sex scenes we mediocre   so if youre a fan of the books reread them instead of seeing the movie and if youve never read them read them instead of seeing the movie
Feb 13 2015,positive,50 shades started off on strange footing considering the casting but with great hope and a book that made me long for it i went to see the movie  a half hour in i was disappointed that some of the more humorous portions of even the first chapter had been removed  we had no idea of what was really happening and as my cowatcher explained joining me in spite of having never read the book she had no clue as to who the characters were what they were doing and well we both left feeling that the sex scenes were not nearly as gratuitous as we were hoping for  i hate to say it but in the words of anastasia steele i was hoping for more  a whole lot more
Feb 13 2015,negative,oh no it was a very slow moving film with sex it was very dull and difficult to sit in after 30 minutes if you are in for the sex it might be a disappointment if you are in for the plot it was definitely a disappointment since there will be two sequels for this movie the ending was a major cliff hanger beware when you see it it might just make you say seriously
Feb 13 2015,negative,just hype  horrible movie tedious and predictable just a freak that likes to beat up girl while having sex oh and has lost of money
Feb 13 2015,positive,saw the movie last night and although i didnt expect certain scenes so much was cut that the movie was somewhat disappointing the ending made it even worse unless there will be a second announced soon i would say to el james to stick to writing i enjoyed the books immensely  the movie not so much but i will say this my friends who didnt read the book liked the movie but once again not the ending
Feb 13 2015,negative,could of been better left out huge plot details i read the book 4 times hug fan but the movie got too much hype i will be staying home for the next 2 movies not worth the money
Feb 13 2015,negative,this movie had an ending that left you wondering why u paid to see it in the first place if u hadnt read the book the movie is a grave disappointment
Feb 13 2015,negative,extremely poor not only did this movie have no substance but seemed to be a flop from the beginning over the top innocent acting from the female lead to casting a leading man that wasnt even good enough for an xrated film there is a reason that several men would not take this part and they were correct to not do so any woman that would allow the act let alone the treatment of a so called mr grey should have her head checked if our women of today see this as a fantasy there is no wonder men treat women poorly and disrespectfully every woman should stand up and speak against this film for the portrayal of saying that a man can set a contract up to owning part of your being i was offended from the start at how this man is not only controlling but a crazy pedophile along with the ultimate butt the author not only shows us now how she is twisted and lost as a woman in the year 2015  but fully  against her own sex not even worth 1 theater for this film  until next time
Feb 13 2015,negative,they had a lot to live up to with this movie and unfortunately it was very boring it just seemed to go back and forth and some big parts in the book were left out which i feel plays into the plot for the second book so that was confusing all in all just not what i was expecting
Feb 13 2015,positive,i am so glad went to see this movie i read all the books probably 5x  im obsessed i even have a grow a mr grey   it def showed a lot more nudity  up close sex than i thought it would i guess i figured it wasnt going to be just like a porno since it was only rated r they should have rated it xxx  i am a little disappointed that they made it seem all about the sex  contract i mean i know thats mainly what the first book was about but it also had other important details they didnt portray  in the movie like her going to internshipjob interviews hello that is a huge part of the story esp because shes independent  tells him she is going to work also where were the blackberrys   i also think that all the bad reviews is just from all the haters who never even gave this book or movie a chance go read your bible  stay away no matter what its here so you cant change that  you cant change peoples minds either
Feb 13 2015,positive,not as bad as i was bracing for  first offlots of nudity good  i thought dakota johnson did a fine job  the rest of the cast was pretty averagenot bad but nothing noteworthy  i enjoyed the back and forth banter on display for the first half of the film but they unfortunately went away from it the last 30 minutes or so  it lost steam as is got near the end  worthwhile endeavor and will probably see the inevitable sequel but certainly wont be counting the days or anything    grade  5510
Feb 13 2015,positive,i dont know why this movie is getting bad reviews  i absolutely loved it  i thought they did a great job sticking to the storyline of the book and i was not disappointed at all  im going to watch it again tonight
Feb 13 2015,positive,the book was a whole better it might have been better if there was a different actress playing anastasia
Feb 13 2015,negative,jamie dornan destroyed christian grey dakota did well along with everyone else totally disappointed
Feb 13 2015,negative,waste of my 13 save your time and money boring movie boring plot boring actors
Feb 13 2015,negative,should of had more about their texts and his family her roommate couldve cut a few sex scenes
Feb 13 2015,negative,im disgusted and uncomfortable that society finds it okay to glorify domestic abuse and emotional manipulation as
Feb 13 2015,negative,read all three books loved them i was all excited to see the movie and as i sat there my attention span for the movie went down the drain so bad that i fell asleep 3 times then we got up and left this is no where near as good of a movie that it could have been if you want to see it just wait for red box
Feb 13 2015,positive,the biggest problem  much like the book  is that most of the scenes are redundant its a decentlymade film that if trimmed by a half hour with more character development probably could have been more effective its not bad and is a great improvement on the book but overall feels very bland and not very exciting given its intended purpose
Feb 13 2015,positive,loved it great book to movie adaptation saw last night going to see tomorrow with husband jamie dornan and dakota johnson great job it was more
Feb 13 2015,positive,dont listen to the reviews watch for yourself i was pleasantly surprised yes there was some parts that were a little awkward but i did enjoy the film and found dakota and jamie to have great chemistry with that ending i am dont think i can wait for the sequel
Feb 13 2015,positive,i came in with low expectations but i really liked it ill definitely see it again
Feb 13 2015,positive,ok starts out kinda like pretty woman buys her all the gifts etc shows her to good life has she got much to complain about a brand new car and laptop and place in new york etc etc in my opinion be grateful most people would die for a life like that
Feb 13 2015,positive,dont listen to the reviews watch and judge for yourself i was pleasantly surprised
Feb 13 2015,positive,woooooooooooooo f truth be told it was not better than the book and it lacked a little in terms of pacing but would i see it again a million times and buy the dvd you know it lol thoseee scenes were amazingly steamy the acting was great it was funny and had enough of the great scenes overall definitelyyy worth a repeat 
Feb 13 2015,positive,this was a good movie it had just enough of everything and told the story in a tasteful and sexy way it also did its job in leaving you wanting to see the next movie entertaining  and fun everyone left the packed house smiling from eat to ear
Feb 13 2015,positive,this movie was everything it was great i knew it would end at book one but book two is just as intense so omggggg bring on movie 2 and 3 must see 50shadesofgrey
Feb 13 2015,positive,i felt the movie was as closely as can be made to the way the book was written the movie brought laughter and emotions by the way the two actors really connected ive read the books myself twice and i can say it was how i had invisioned it i would definitely watch that again
Feb 13 2015,negative,i just cant believe people actually want to see this piece of crap
Feb 13 2015,positive,better than i expected pleasantly surprised by all the humorous moments  more graphic than i thought it would be for the r rating but less graphic than it needed to be to truly reflect the story  i do think viewers will be lost and confused unless youve read the book we were filling in blanks mentally because we knew the story
Feb 13 2015,positive,seeing the movie tonight and am looking forward to it i am a huge fan of the books and wont be put of by silly negative reviews
Feb 13 2015,positive,i loved the book to movie adaptation overall the movie is basically just like the book  there were a few scenes that had to be left out but there was no way they could translate the entire book into the movie the sex scenes were tastefully done   imo if people like the book they will like the movie  dakota did an amazing job of portraying every facet of ana dakota did an amazing job of portraying every facet of ana  i am a huge charlie hunnam fan actually he is the reason i finally gave in and read the books i was upset when he backed out and doubted at first jamie being cast however after seeing the moving jamie is christian he brought the stiff standoffish cold older in manner than years christian to life i could see his struggles with realizing he actually felt real emotions about a woman the struggle with changing for her staying away from her honestly after watching the i cant see anyone else as christian or ana  the ending had me in tears and i went home and immediately started a reread of book 2 fifty shades darker  applause to jamie dornan dakota johnson sam taylorjohnson kelly marcel el james and the entire cast and crew for bring fifty shades of grey to life in such a splendid classy funny sexy manner  bring on darker and freed
Feb 13 2015,positive,i effin luv it cant wait for the next one
Feb 13 2015,negative,made me physically sick tries to sell an emotionally manipulative and abusive relationship as a healthy bdsm relationship christian is a sociopath stalker and abuses a clueless girl under the guise of it being a normal bdsm relationship
Feb 13 2015,neutral,film classy and elegant  the actors were up to expectations  the dakota has definitely overcome directed fast  with many tagliue correction than the original  s for those who have not read the book often is difficult to understand the scenes  looks like a big trailer or spot  not a movie  definitely not addictive  too bad
Feb 13 2015,negative,oh my god what was this monstrosity
Feb 13 2015,negative,fifty shades of grey reinforces all the stereotypes society has come to love whats more is that grey is too safe to enjoy looking more like a disneyprincessfairytale with bits of artistically laid out sex scenes grey is indeed the hot millionaire who is all talk but no game
Feb 13 2015,positive,what i expected  didnt disappoint or excite me  a decent job portraying the story
Feb 13 2015,neutral,dakota was surprisingly entertaining and without her the movie would have flopped  jamie he just kind of ruined it for me  the cheesy 1 liners had me cringing in the theater
Feb 13 2015,negative,stick to the books i was really let down by the movie i felt like it turned towards abuse where the books did not leave me feeling that way at all it was truly a let down in all ways possible
Feb 13 2015,negative,nice softporn scenes  but overall it is a poor film with a mediocre script and plot
Feb 13 2015,positive,it was very good it was very loyal to the book it was soft compared to the book why i always tell everybody read the book before watching the movie but i loved it and it and critics are full of crap you cant be biased and watch this movie you have to enjoy it for what it is ive seen more sex more dick and game of thrones than youll ever see in fifty shades of grey
Feb 13 2015,positive,it was ok not hardcore like the book i like both of the actors outside of the movie thought they could have done a better job in the movie i like how they ended the book though
Feb 13 2015,positive,expected a more detailed and structured plot sadly the movie didnt exceed my expectations
Feb 13 2015,positive,it is a different kind of love story well starting at the beginning  i thought the movie was done very tasteful and a good adaptation of the book i didnt find it boring  dakota johnson is stunning liked her character and jamie dornan plays the role of christian very well not to mention he is very easy on the eyes and to me you could feel what he felt  it is a sensual tale  if you  are a fan it is worth the watch
Feb 13 2015,negative,very disappointing  the movie left out so many key plot items boat house anas new job and boss the very important email exchange around anas trip to georgia that are key to plots of the remaining story line  if you read the book dont bother seeing the movie its not even worth a 2 matinee price  if you havent read the book skip the movie and read the book
Feb 13 2015,negative,i was never tempted in any way whatsoever to read the book and its sequels on which this movie is based in spite of its global success originally inspired as twilight fan fiction twilight being another book series that i avoided though i did sadly watch the movies the series received mostly derisive but also guiltypleasure reviews while racking up big bucks  plus a picture deal  for its author el james it told the story of virginal college student anastasia steele who meets handsome young gazillionaire christian grey  a man with serious control and other issues and a taste for kink  and plunges into a sadomasochistic relationship in which he is the dominant and she the submissive except that plucky young ms steele doesnt quite take to the lifestyle as mr grey might want making the central conflict of the book and series the question of whether or not anastasia can change or heal christian and mold him into the man she would prefer to love rich strong and like totally into her but without the whips and chains    since i havent read the book i cannot tell you where the movie directed by sam taylorjohnson nowhere boy departs from its source material i can tell you however that based on what is on screen if this is what bdsm is all about ill take a pass as i like to think of sex as an alternately exciting romantic and intimate  or ideally all three  communion between two or more lets not judge consensual souls and what we get here is none of that instead we have two actors who look bored in each others presence going through the motions of sex and bondage with neither zest nor passion say what you will about the artistic merits of a film like nine 12 weeks  an obvious comparison  but the characters played by mickey rourke and kim basinger seemed at a minimum to enjoy being in each others presence unfortunately for ms jamess fan base there is no chemistry whatsoever between the heretofore littleknown dakota johnson need for speed  daughter of don johnson and melanie griffith  and her costar jamie dornan flying home    at least ms johnson is fun to watch much to my surprise shes got moxie based on my reaction to the nauseating trailer i expected to not only loathe the film but both actors as well instead i found myself thoroughly won over by the young female lead until the tedium of the script and listless sex scenes take over the movie ms johnson livens up every scene she is in which is most with her winsome spirit and energy its not her fault that the source text requires her to bite her lip like a schoolgirl and she makes the most of what opportunities there are to rise above the material the same cannot be said for mr dornan an actor with the screen presence of daysold meatloaf this is a man who at 27 has somehow managed to amass a huge fortune and create a vast empire i dont think so granted his is a thankless task he has to somehow incarnate a man who has to be strong sexy dominant yet also somehow vulnerable im sure that greater actors than mr dornan would fail as well and yet it would have been nice to see him actually try can you imagine mickey rourke wining after the fact about how he hates seeing his bum on screen hey nobody forced you to make this awful movie dude could you not even try to match dakota johnsons effort    leaving aside the politics of whether we need in 2015 yet another cinderella fantasy of the poor girl offered a life of pleasure and leisure by a fantastically rich man or whether or not a film about a dominantsubmissive relationship is appropriate for valentines day  all besides the point for those who just want a naughty escapist movie to watch  the greatest sin of this movie is that it is just so absolutely dreadfully boring im 50 shades of fed up utters the tortured mr grey if only he really were then we might have something interesting on our hands    heres a suggestion for you if youre into what the story promises yet fails to deliver stay in and rent last years venus in fur this weekend instead youll have a better  and sexier  time
Feb 13 2015,positive,the movie was phenomenal the character dynamic was just insanity the good kind both anastasia and christian were such round characters there were distinct change between both of them as the entire movie went on anastasia explores her sexuality as well as learns to stand up for herself with christian and stand up for herself in life christian learns how to open up and finally express his emotional past with another person the funny thing is if you watch the movie all this stupid controversy   over people complaining about women being degraded and abused its simply not true there is obvious consent given for christian to perform any act of what would have been totally considered inappropriate without it they dont even say that being submissive is only for females they made it clear that males can be and can enjoy being a submissive themselves the story was phenomenal the second you detach the possible uncomfortable feeling one might have in not seeing the common traditional appeals to sex and pay closer attention to what is actually the underlying reasoning for the more severe aspects of the relationship it becomes a truly beautiful story i think it was amazing and cannot wait for the second one assuming taylor will be directing and james will have less of a force on the film
Feb 13 2015,positive,i felt the movie was very well done  just as the books it brings you in and has you wanting more
Feb 13 2015,negative,wtf did i just watch
Feb 13 2015,negative,remake please new cast and definitely a new director yes director is to blame here bad cast and not well put together i could give a whole list of things that should have been done differently but it would be a long list of things that are annoyingly obvious
Feb 13 2015,negative,no plot terrible acting best way to describe the whole experience from start to finish is awkward and a waste of time even the people who were into it at the end all went is that it only positive is danny elfmans score which deserves one star
Feb 13 2015,positive,people in this country have a problem with sex its a shame and surprising  porn is a multibillion dollar industry so why are people so quick to judge this movie based on a part of the story it presents    this film at its core is about two people that meet in different moments of their lives to heal each other    to all those haters you need a spanking
Feb 13 2015,negative,if only it was put in a tv series instead of movie
Feb 13 2015,negative,50 shades of grey is a terrible film thats right i am getting straight to the point this film is poorly written didnt push that rated r rating and never pushes that rating to the limit the only good thing about this film is dakota johnsons performance and was well shot jamie  dornan was okay but the rest was terrible to wrap it up dont see this movie fan or not
Feb 13 2015,positive,though i didnt love the coming attraction when i did see it i at first it was ok but i got into the movie quickly  the characters grow on you and i was made fairly accurate based on the book
Feb 13 2015,positive,i was impressed with dakota johnson   i didnt think she would be able to pull it off but she did a very good job  hate cliff hangers but ill be back for part 2
Feb 13 2015,positive,personally i loved the movie come on its an erothic movie it all about the book and the book just talk about sex so thats what we saw they did a great job its too difficult play those scenes naked for real
Feb 13 2015,positive,met all of my expectations
Feb 13 2015,negative,terrible acting in a smut movie
Feb 13 2015,negative,el jamess erotic novel fifty shades of grey is one of those books that virtually everyone has heard about  it started off as a twilight fanfiction  talking about the book in public probably makes you feel pretty dirty  it spawned two sequels  and bdsm bondage and discipline domination and submission sadism and masochism is the key ingredient that is supposed to define the novel  the movie begins with a young virginal woman anastasia steele dakota johnson interviewing christian grey jamie dornan a young billionaire with a secret past and unique sexual interests  anas best friend was initially supposed to interview him but the plotconvenient flu prevents her from attending henceforth requiring ana to go in her place  christian seduces the young woman and introduces her to a world where pain and pleasure are intertwined and the line between romance and abuse is barely noticeable   christian informs ana that he is a dominant and that he wants her to be his submissive  he hands her a bdsm styled contract asking her to look it over sign it and surrender herself to him  throughout the film ana is forced to deal with christian as she attempts to deal with christians need for her to be a sex slave so that he can control and punish her  for the most part the film stays true to the source material which means the same controversial aspects and depravitydriven moments in the novel find their way into the picture  several moments in the book indicate that the relationship is uninformed consent at best and christians stalker tendencies unhealthy behavior and abusive habits make the character look like a predator  ultimately fifty shades of grey is a poorly made and severely flawed film that is oftentimes depressing  calling fifty shades of grey a porno would be largely inaccurate as the 2 hour film has only 15 minutes worth of sex  a porno would also have to some type of titillation or arousal factor  however the sex scenes are relatively tame and they dont come close to pushing the envelope on the r rating  neither johnson nor dornan is shown fullfrontal and the camera cuts away every time an act of penetration is about to occur or is occurring  the scenes in the red room are particularly underwhelming as the filmmakers fail to show the differentiating factors between traditional sex and the bondage that ana becomes exposed to  the sex isnt hot or kinky  its just typical rrated sex         since less than 20 of the films running time is devoted to sex scenes that means there has to be a story to support a film with a 125 minute runtime  however the story is weak and the plot is nonexistent  none of the supporting characters or side characters are given the screentime or development that is necessary for a story to work  one friend of anas after attempting to make a move on her never returns  he just disappears entirely  kate is just there to be a character prop  characters related to ana and christian just show up for the sake of showing up  the film largely focuses on ana and christians relationship but there is no genuine development and the actors lack chemistry  even in sex scenes the action feels forced and the filmmakers desire to avoid close ups of the sexual acts and the characters reactions make it even tougher to connect or care about the characters onscreen  as the film goes on it becomes painfully obvious that the majority of the films events occur for the sake of occurring and so that the existence of the sex scenes can be justified   dakota johnson is well cast  she successfully conveys anas inexperience and naivety  her character is given little to do besides being confused getting bossed around and attempting to break through christians shell  however johnson makes the most out of the role that she is given  in a picture with little energy and a bland story she provides the picture with some spark  jamie dornan on the other hand is badly miscast  he has no charm is creepy on several occasions and he fails to develop any chemistry with johnson  most of that falls on the screenplay and its source material  its really difficult to root for a guy that has no redeeming or sympathetic qualities  its even worse when the character comes off as a stalker and a guy with serious psychological issues  however dornan fails to do anything with a bland role that relegates him to being a predatorstalker cast type  those who have no knowledge of the source material will not care about christian grey    the film is directed by sam taylorjohnson and her direction is sloppy and incoherent  the music composed by danny elfman of all people fails to make an impact and the screenplay adapted by kelly marcel maintains the novels flaws and suffers from several plot contrivances  in the first five minutes the film becomes saddled with a laughable contrivance  are we really supposed to believe that the flu would keep kate an aspiring journalist from interviewing one of the most recognized people and successful billionaires in the world  are we supposed to believe that christian would fall for ana upon first sight knowing that she may not accept his lifestyle  why is he stalking her if he tells her that she should stay clear of him  and are we really supposed to believe that christian and the woman who molested him as a child could ever be friends in any capacity at all   the dialogue ranges from bad to laugh out loud awful  dornans dialogue in particular is horrendous and its difficult not to snicker or shake your head when he says that he likes to fuck hard or that he is fifty shades of fucked up  a scene where the couple discusses the contract in business fashion is awkwardly set up poorly shot and generates a lot of laughs but not in a good way       the filmmakers attempt to emphasize that what christian is doing to ana is consensual  however a good portion of his disturbing and stalkerabusive dominantdriven dialogue remains intact  furthermore anas inexperience and lack of sexual knowledge make it evident that the sexual acts and punishments inflicted upon her by christian are not entirely consensual  fifty shades of grey became popular largely due to its themes involving bdsm but the film and the series as a whole present a twisted and a highly inaccurate representation of a bdsm lifestyle  i dont know if an nc17 rating would have made this movie better or improved upon the severely flawed screenplay but it would have at least allowed the filmmakers to explore unchartered territory  fans of the novel will probably embrace this adaptation  purists may have some issues with the translation as several characters from the book are missing and various scenes have been shortened or eliminated entirely including that infamous tampon scene  however even diehards may come away feeling disappointed and shortchanged especially when it comes to the films ending    the movie retains the books ending and doesnt have a proper resolution  the movie doesnt really end or wrap up anything  it just stops  and that is what makes the experience frustrating and dissatisfying  anyone looking to watch this film as a standalone and get a satisfying resolution out of it will be highly disappointed  the film thrives on setting up events for sequels and that is among its chief missteps  that in itself is depressing    fifty shades of grey generated controversy and demands for boycotts due to its male lead being viewed as a proponent of domestic abuse and sexual violence  does this film and the series its based off of glorify abuse  i think it does  regardless of your views on this issue it is evident that this movie does an awful job representing bdsm lifestyles fails to show ana giving informed consent and embraces far too many sexual stereotypes why do people in films with unusual sexual interests or an active sex drive have to be molested andor traumatized in order to have sexual urges  anyone looking for a film to learn about bdsm or sex or healthy relationships shouldnt watch this movie  i dont know if there are any erotic novels out there that could become quality major motion pictures but fifty shades of grey is not a quality motion picture  not even close  it doesnt work as a movie as softcore porn or as an educational tool and its highly unlikely that the two inevitable sequels or if hollywood gets greedy and splits the final book into two parts will satisfy those that werent already devoted to this bizarre and oftentimes depressing series  in one scene ana asks christian to enlighten her  the character does and she learns what he is like  for audiences the cinematic experience is just as brutal and frustrating  those who are looking for a good movie or even a sexually arousing one involving romance sex andor bdsm should seek enlightenment elsewhere
Feb 13 2015,negative,worst acting ever characters all wrong loved the books movie not so much very disappointed
Feb 13 2015,positive,i  saw fifty shades last night and have to say that it was much better than i thought it would be   first of all  not every detail made it from the book to the movie  not necessarily a bad thing   the sex scenes are done in a way thats sexy yet tasteful  theres much more to ana and christians complicated relationship than meets the eye and dakota johnson and jamie dornan manage to get that across effectively   good music and a glossy look at christians world make this worth seeing again
Feb 13 2015,negative,i never thought bdsm could be so boringuntil now anastasia carried this crappy movie i want to see her get more work dialogue was crap the writing was crap very poor effort
Feb 13 2015,positive,the movie was above my expectations no idea why there are so many negative reviews i think dakota and jamie were great together they played their parts perfectlythe intimate scenes werent too heavy just enough to make you feel a little uncomfortable in a room full of people i am looking forward to movie 2  3
Feb 13 2015,positive,i havenât read any of the fifty shades books so i went into last nightâs screening cold i think that was the problem  i honestly thought the story was just about a young sexually inexperienced woman who meets a slightly older extremely sexually experienced rich man and he teaches her everything she needs to know but i was wrong have you seen the movie cruel intentions how about the movie wild things yait has a lot more rated r  i believe  i will say that this production isnt your every day romance chick flick i felt rather uncomfortable in some parts not knowing other peoples reactions to the hbo cinemax type of scenes i will say though the cinematography is beautiful its all seattle skyscapes and polished pretty shots i didnt know seattle looked that good the storyline definitely has some tough particulars in it i can see how reading the series might make this more interesting i honestly thought this was some softer romantic type of film but i was way offyou definitely do not wanna go with your family in this fiction showcase but overall it was quite eye catching to say the least it has you glued to the screen and doesnt allow much time to breathe throughout i kept thinking  oh my god they just didnt do that on film it worried me a little because if i was a parent  i definitely dont want this to slip out to my teenager if i had one  i guess in time theres no stopping anyone since its out in the theatre i will say it was different  and different  fictional jaw dropping type of movies is where hollywood seems to somewhat more or less seem to have going still overcome that so much graphic material was in this movie  ive seen some pretty racy types of love stories but this took the cake   in sum as the credits rolled someone in the theatre yelled what haha groans and laughsâbut no one moved from their seats right away because we were all kind of waiting for more and that pretty much says it all âââââ dje
Feb 13 2015,positive,it really skipped too many scenes from the book the scenes were off but if you read the book then you get whats going on i really dont think the chemistry between the actors was there to make the movie more enticing
Feb 13 2015,negative,wow just finished this film tonight i was highly disappointed the sex scenes were not that appealing i thought i was going to have a embarrassing boner at the end of the movie but nope the chemistry of the actors was interested or believable  this movie makes the interview pacer nominee worthy save your money folks watch for lifetime or red box to show it
Feb 13 2015,negative,so bad so incredibly bad  people in the theater were laughing on how bad it was
Feb 13 2015,positive,enjoyed the movie of course its not perfect but it follows just about everything in the first book all the up to the ending they had to leave out a few details but overall pretty damn close cant wait till the next one comes out
Feb 13 2015,positive,if you read the book you will notice some things were rearranged  but for the most part for me they stayed true to the book  it was comical and sensual in all the right places  i gave it 4 stars because jamie was not my first choice for christian but he did pull it off so kudos to him  if you actually listen to critics and yes air quotes were needed because for some reason they think their opinions mean more than ours  they are dogging this movie but you should make up your own mind  come on critics get out that thesaurus and show us your big words
Feb 13 2015,positive,i really enjoyed the film i thought that jamie dornan was sexy as hell and the heat between him and dakota johnson was palpable i will definitely be seeing this movie again
Feb 13 2015,negative,fifity shades of grey was one of the biggest books of 2011 it introduced many readers to the world of bdsm and also helped them introduce it into their intimate moments when it was announced that universal studios bought the rights to the book and were going to make a movie many people mostly women were excited and patiently waiting for the movie to come out alas fans of the book prepare to be disappointed  the 1 hour 50 minute movie was pure boredom there was nothing in the movie that justified the hype of the book the dialogue was very dull and the characters did not interest me when you compare this movie to the adult movies out there the adult movies would be like shakespeare i beleive that you can see better movies late night on cinemax the one thing that hollywood did wrong was not make this movie nc17 they knew what they were getting into when they got the rights to this book instead they watered it down to a lame r rated movie also hollywood should not have decided to branch out into the adult movie industry they should leave that to the professionals  save your money folks for more entertaining movies like the movie secretary it was a  2002 movie that dealt with the theme of bdsm it was a dark comedy a lot more entertaining than 50 shades and had a character named grey   note i think you may have seen this already i can tell you that this was more entertaining than the movie you can either click on the link or cut  paste it to your browser enjoy  
Feb 13 2015,positive,was not expecting fifty shades of grey to be that good im glad that they stuck to the book overall i would recommend people to watch the film
Feb 13 2015,positive,i thought the movie was good stayed fairly true to the books dakota was amazing as ana and jamie was great as christian the movie seemed a bit choppy i dont know if that was the directors style but i wanted it to flow a bit better from scene to scene overall i liked the comedy added into the movie i dont understand the people saying jaime seemed stuff and gave nothing to the character if you read the books you would understand that christian gives nothing away he always has a guard up not wanting to let ana seem him or to know him i think jaime portrayed that very well it is not until the 2nd book or movie we will see him open up and show who he reat is all in all 5 stars for me cant wait to see it again
Feb 13 2015,positive,a better version of the book if youre not into bdsm just dont even bother watching this
Feb 13 2015,positive,fifty shades of grey toes kinky line    as this erotic fantasy story began it was immediately apparent that this movie journey would take a path much different from most within seconds of the movies start applause was heard from the excited and overwhelmingly female audience who realized that their long wait to see the film was finally over that roar of approval was quickly followed by giggles and laughter as a man yelled words of caution from the theaters back row do not try this at home and by this he meant kinky sex powerful seduction techniques and total dominance in the bedroom yes fifty shades of grey has all of those sexual qualities however it also offers more    this widely anticipated adaption of el james international bestselling fictional novel finds a 27year old seattle billionaire named christian grey jamie dornan pursuing the younger anastasia steele dakota johnson an english literature major about to graduate from college the wealthy grey who we learn had a rough start to life refuses to do affection girlfriends or romance    fifty shades of grey offers an escapism for viewers wanting to look inside others bedrooms toy boxes and sexual adventurism its kinky without being raunchy or sordid its seductive with tangibles that include hand  leg restraints blindfolds necktiesand ice cubes the strong sexual content and language that created this films massive hype only appear in appropriate scenes that are relevant to the overall storyline no gratuitous sex just dominantsubmissive foreplay and intimacy    what makes this film so interesting isnt the power and influence imparted by dornans christian grey character upon the physically weaker ana steele this movies main catalyst is miss steeles ability to go toetotoe with mr grey pushing back on his misguided mannerisms renegotiating his nondisclosure agreements all the while attempting to come to terms with her own emotional and physical limits  the banter between the costars throughout the film is abundant easy and feels natural lastly both dornan and johnson deserve credit for betterthanexpected acting performances in this bondage story    no film can ever compete with a readers vast imagination created from reading a book however most moviegoers who have read fifty shades of grey should be very satisfied with this sexual fantasy unfurled upon the big screen while it may not have been possible for the film to live up to all of its prerelease hype fifty shades of grey does give viewers what theyve come to expect explicit dominantsubmissive sex  and lots of it    grade b    patrick king is a writer for the reel brief movie blog at   you may email him at reelbriefmoviereviewsmailcom
Feb 13 2015,negative,abuse wrapped up in kinky sex this means if you try to say its abuse people just think you dont understand bdsm   no christian never hurts her theres nothing wrong with the sex  its how he treats her outside the bedroom  its deplorable   el james is absolute trash
Feb 13 2015,negative,kate what was he like    anastasia he was polite intense smart  really intimidating  fifty shades of grey is one of those movies that will end up being credited more for the hype around it than what is actually seen in the film  this is a film based on the first book in a trilogy of bestselling erotic romance novels that seemingly aspires to be placed in the same territory as something like sex lies and videotape or body heat but is far too bland in execution which seems like the presumed result of twilight fanfiction cometolife  i imagine there could be plenty to say about a potential blockbuster film based on a novel by a woman el james adapted by a woman kelly marcel directed by a woman sam taylorjohnson and featuring a female lead dakota johnson who takes charge on a man who masks his inadequacies with a certain kind of appearance and use of dominance behind closed doors but it comes more from what the viewer ultimately needs to extrapolate from the film rather having a film that more effectively conveys proper purpose in a story like this  the only caveat i can provide at this early stage is that i have not read the book but i doubt the many giggling women at my screening have read it either    read the whole review at thecodeiszeekcom
Feb 13 2015,positive,i just saw the movie and it did not get me hot at all after like the third love making scene i was falling asleep the characters were very wishy washy and did not stay true to their persona like ana was suppose to be this timid girl that was in love but she did not seem to be really into him and always avoids him christian did not seem that controlling and the scenes were very very tame like all he did was tie her up and lightly whip her or dust her off with a feather lol i was expecting something a little bit more shocking my bf and i kept looking at each other like dude we can do better in the sack than this snooze fest the only thing that shocked us was the fact that two single mothers brought an infant and a six year old child to the theater to watch it and got escorted out by the manager what were those ladies thinking other than that i dont see what the craze and fascination about this book because it was soooo vanilla and people who like it must be having some boring bedroom routines ive seen hotter stuff on a google search 
Feb 13 2015,positive,was funny entertaining and all around better than the book not sure why other people dont feel the same way sure the sex scenes werent super provocative but honestly this story is more about love and they did that well dakota johnson was awesome in this movie
Feb 13 2015,neutral,5310   fifty shades of grey might not be as bad as people wanted it to be or at least thought it would be but it sure conveys a pretty bad message and overall feeling yes it might be sexy at times but it was never arousing nor appealing but instead it gives you this sense of worry for anastasiaplayed very well by dakota johnsonbecause she clearly has no identity or self respect and so it can be somewhat dark and disturbing meanwhile christianportrayed blandly by jamie dornanis clearly a control freak that wants to use and control her but it is all extremely sugar coated that it might even seem as true romance but it is not for the most part however the movie was indeed very well directed by sam taylorjohnson based on its material and its cinematography looked very nice as well also the soundtrack of the movie was fairly good but sometimes too distracting when played in the more erotic scenes that said the movie is not as graphic as you might think in my opinion but still it has its moments of roughness moreover as i mentioned before the performances were partially good mainly from dakota johnson who gives this awkwardness and lightness to her character in a very dark movie but it is jaime dornan that clearly misses the mark and comes out as more secondary and kind of empty only depending on his looks and attractiveness overall this is surely one of those movies that people will love to hate or at least thats how i feel even though im still undecided what to really think because it has much more than just this masochistic relationship its not as simple as black or white and so thats what really challenges me to really analyze it and see what it is trying to say thus it was entertaining but not quite as shocking and it might not be the healthiest romance on film but still it has a big impact on todays society and culture so hopefully it wont influence as much but still it is something fun and out of the ordinary to experience at the movie theater by yourself and decide if you like it or not     february 12 2015
Feb 12 2015,positive,this movie is worth seeing if you are a 50 shades fan although there are a few awkward moments in the beginning you can really feel ana and christians connection as the movie goes on there is not a dull moment i feel it was tastefully done and stays true to the integrity and essence of the book without being overdone this movie truly had potential to crash and burn and i must say i went into it very skeptical and came out pleasantly surprised i would even take it a step further and say i was even moved by the performances of the couple but especially with dakota she embodies ana steeles innocence and naivety while still injecting her own sass and humorous interactions here and there if you are a fan you should go see this
Feb 12 2015,positive,fun fact im not into bdsm and i still like the book series for the story and romance just saw it it was pretty great it followed the book very well and i think the chemistry was good between them i think if you like the book series you will like this because this has to be a movie series they didnt do all books in one movie cough cough avatar the last airbender did that and we all know how terrible the story got chopped i think the actors did a great job and totally happy surprise to see the pride and prejudice lead in the bbc series be steeles mother    i think a lot of critics hate the movie but it really just depends on you taste    spolier alert    if you havent read the books you may feel left off on the movies ending but it definitly makes you want them to continue their story    i want to stress i dont like bdsm but the movie is still good the only bad bdsm happens at the end of this first movie it seemed like a minute long because they had it in the book which is good that they put it in the movie because the main girl leaves him because of that the rest of the movie is pretty light     fellow ladies only thing is that if they are going to go through the trouble of having full nude and sex scenes why didnt they show allevery side of steeles body is shown why didnt we get a glimpse of the guysparts like why are they holding back
Feb 12 2015,negative,terrible film acting isnt bad but its a terrible depiction of bdsm and idealizes rape and abuse spent more time feeling uncomfortable than entertained
Feb 12 2015,positive,i was very skeptical to watch this kind of movie but at the end i have to say im very impressed both did well film was tasteful clean goog job â
Feb 12 2015,positive,although too safe to please as one might say it still has a big surprise  the fact that ms steele is so natural and lovable wow not my reaction from reading the book and the soundtrack is a bomb
Feb 12 2015,positive,have never read the books went with wife and it is an okay movie not bad and not good i think it is just going to be popular for people to bash the movie but there are plenty of movies out there that are way worse than 50 shades of grey the only thing that i thought was an issue was that jamie dornan did not do a good job hiding his accent personally i would not have cast him in that role either but that is just personal preference he does a descent job except for the accent thing  the sex scenes are not as big of a deal as people are making them out to be it is in no way close to soft porn like people are saying they are more risque than what you see in most movies when you go to a theater but its definitely not close to porn also keep in mind i am not comparing it to the book because i have not read it i am rating it simply as a movie i have no clue if it is true to the book
Feb 12 2015,negative,do not waste your money wait to see it on netflix unless you read the books you will have no idea what is going on  absolutely horrible seriously the acting is so bad
Feb 12 2015,positive,its definitely a guilty pleasure movie it was fun to watch but i hate the way they ended it perfect for ladies night out but dont drag your man to it hell hate it
Feb 12 2015,negative,if you knew nothing about this movie and stumbled into the theater this clunker could very well be the worst thing you have ever seen 20 hours of cable softcore are better than this piece of shit     the movie is long boring and makes alien feel like the last tango in paris the chemistry between the leads is non existent the story is bland and boring and even the nudity is cheap    the production and cast lack the charm or charisma to make the film entertaining and there are too many cheap tactics that are supposed to pass as classy and refined     i never read the book so i have no frame of reference but if the written version is as bad as the movie i would support book burning
Feb 12 2015,neutral,ill admit to seeing this out of curiosity as to whether the movie actually improved on the books i found the books completely unreadable and supporting a destructive abusive relationship the movie however has softened some of these  negative aspectsnot eliminated but toned down while the movie was still rather disturbing obsession stalking  some physical abuse beyond consensual sex it is far more watchable than the books are readable the actors despite their real life opinions of each other had good chemistry and manage to make the characters more interesting and less insipid or unlikable than the books i didnt go expecting a topnotch script or acting i got what i expected a steamy erotic movie geared towards some womens fantasies simply put its an adult check your brain at the door adult film
Feb 12 2015,positive,i thought it was really good  it stayed very true to the book i was extremely happy with both jaime dornan and dakota johnson for the leads  they both did very good at actually becoming the part if you will i thought the sexual parts were tastefully done  i really love the love story in 50 shades so if you havent read the books and see this movie i dont think you can capture truly the actual intent and  understanding of the characters      this isnt just a movie about sex and bdsm its about a very powerful man who has  very messed up views due to a pretty bad childhood and anastasia comes along and changes those views and his mindset little by little they learn and love each other very much through lots of trial and error as for the ending everybody is complaining about its exactly how the first book ends    jamie dornan had all the looks of 50 50 shades of fucked up  in the book el james is very descriptive as to the many sides of christian serious predictor boyish murcrial ext dornan displayed all of those characteristics in his roll these books arent exactly easy to display on screen so i was very happy with how it was done dakota johnson played her role exceptionally well i see anastasia when i look at her so for me she is anastasia again in order to understand the characters in this movie youre going to have to read the books       i loved it  it was well balanced sexy as helland tastefully done considering the content of the books      the only thing i think they could have done a better job on was some of the missing details from the book granted you cannot put everything in the book into the movie however i am curious to see how theyre going to add jack hyde in to the sequel given they never even mentioned him through the movie he is pretty substantial throughout the rest of the books  given their budget im sure they will figure something out i just hope the rest of the story stays on track to the storyline and doesnt veer off much
Feb 12 2015,positive,not a horrible movie i was emotionally vested but jamie dornan was not intense enough for my liking i hated the sadistic sex scenes
Feb 12 2015,positive,loved it ill see it again for sure
Feb 12 2015,positive,very well written  directed  kudos to both actors cant wait for 2 oh love the sense of humor throughout
Feb 12 2015,positive,if you read the book you will notice some things were rearranged  but for the most part for me they stayed true to the book  it was comical and sensual in all the right places  i gave it 4 stars because jamie was not my first choice for christian but he did pull it off so kudos to him  if you actually listen to critics and yes air quotes were needed because for some reason they think their opinions mean more than ours  they are dogging this movie but you should make up your own mind
Feb 12 2015,negative,fifty shades of grey is a weaker version of secretary 2002 stunning camera work and respectful performance from dakota johnson jamie dornan weak performance is stiff dull and lack of chemistry that suppose to be a powerful decisive successful but broken man fifty shades of grey struggle to have a fluid flow of plot while trying to setup the next sequel
Feb 12 2015,positive,what a fun evening a bit of fluff movie with a flawed mr grey blending the books for the last part of the show
Feb 12 2015,neutral,to see the carrots is come to life was amazing for me
Feb 12 2015,neutral,the problem with 50 shades of grey is that it doesnt amount to much it is a mediocre highbudget softcore porn film with an electrifying cast but a shitpoor script and absolutely moronic portrayal of bdsm dakota j is adorably awkward yet strongwilled and jaime d is gorgeously brooding and mysterious unfortunately it feels exactly like what a lifetimesponsored porn film would feel like bland and badly written even if it gets steamy as hell while certain aspects of the film such as its ending  tackled very interesting concepts concerning feminism dominance and psychological instability the film was more concerned in showing you two hot actors have sex for 20 minutes than it was in making a societal statement the only redeeming quality of the film is jaime looking intensely at dakota and saying i dont make love i fuck hard
Feb 12 2015,negative,i feel as tho some owes me 2hrs of my life back
Feb 12 2015,positive,the acting was a little rough in the beginning but the movie stayed true to the book worth seeing if you enjoyed the books
Feb 12 2015,negative,mostly boring but well shot and a solid performance from dakota johnson shades is just terrible what makes it worse is the terrible ending
Feb 12 2015,negative,so very very disappointed no chemistry i knew going in that i would not like the leadsif you had not read the book you might have been saved the heartbreak my imagination killed the movie for mei walked out without 30 minutes left in the movie yep i was that mad
Feb 12 2015,positive,loved every second and i am enjoying the books now    i just love jamie and dakota in these parts
Feb 12 2015,positive,great movie i recommend that you read the book first great actors
Feb 12 2015,positive,i personally enjoyed the film overall with great actorsactresses but definitely had mixed feelings about the drama and relationship surrounding domination  submission weirded me out in some parts
Feb 12 2015,positive,i personally loved the movie and the actors i do think that if u havent read the book you wont get as much out of it as someone who has read it  i think that they did a good job taking a 20 hour audiobook 400 page book and condensing it into 2 hours movie your always going to depth from a book because a movie cant show you what someone is thinking
Feb 12 2015,positive,chemistry missing between them but it kept to the bookso when is the next part coming out
Feb 12 2015,positive,the script of the movie and the scenes they changed in the movie made christian less awkward i hated the cast before i saw the movie now i cant imagine anyone else playing those parts there was a few scenes not in the movie but then again they contain sex and they cut quite a bit of those scenes to stay in the r rating all the main scenes were in the film most were the exact same but a few were remade which were 10x better than the book so looking forward to the second movie
Feb 12 2015,negative,the movie really shows how poorly written the books are it was like watching a bad soap opera for two and a half hours
Feb 12 2015,positive,fifty shades of grey more like fifty shades of great i went into this movie with neutral hopes i was afraid it would be another cheesy valentines day movie thankfully it was not when youre watching this movie you forget what time of year it is the character development was pretty good and jamie dornan did a good job as well the movie was very wellmade go see this you wont be disappointed
Feb 12 2015,positive,loved it  if you enjoyed the books youll enjoy the movie
Feb 12 2015,negative,worst movie ive seen in a long time
Feb 12 2015,negative,took a girlfriend to see this its a disappointing fantasy flick which was at times creepy and weird this woman owes me big time now
Feb 12 2015,negative,a repulsive attempt to justify sexual abuse combining sex and physical abuse is never acceptable in any context
Feb 12 2015,positive,first movie that i see that does not fall short after reading the book
Feb 12 2015,negative,laughably ridiculous
Feb 12 2015,negative,i initially had absolutely no interest in seeing this but seeing as i had no opinion on how bad it was gonna be i had to its based upon the best selling book blah blah blah the film was terrible from writing to the acting which was somehow worse than the writing its true i havent seen a film like this which makes it somewhat original but the story was so uninteresting that i cant describe it of course had we a better script with better dialogue and story then there may have been a better film but alas it wasnt and will go down amongst some of the worst films i have ever seencongratulations
Feb 12 2015,positive,this review is coming from someone who hasnt read any of the books and doesnt intend to  i found the actors to be fitting and believable from an audience perspective the suspense was very intense when needed and just when you thought grey would break he found an edgy way to remain mysteriously dominant the sex scenes were very intimate and crudely erotic in all the right ways gladly recommended
Feb 12 2015,positive,the movie doesnt live up to the book jamie and dakota dont seem to have much chemistry but i see potential in coming up in the next movies because i felt towards the end of the movie they were getting better i think much of the disappointment lies within the sexual nature of the book that can not be represented in the movie and still rate as r however i think i would have liked the movie more hadnt i read the books
Feb 12 2015,positive,cant believe im saying this but man this got me hooked cant wait for part 2 it surpass my expectations i thought i was going to dread going to watch it but man go watch it
Feb 12 2015,positive,just came from the cinemathat was stunningnice job
Feb 12 2015,negative,domestic abuse disguised as a romance absolutely awful
Feb 12 2015,positive,this is one of the best book to film adaptations ive seen the casting is done rather well  and the film is shown to be almost page for page accurate with the book all in all if you liked the book then youll like the film
Feb 12 2015,negative,this is basicly porn it glorifies abusive relationships
Feb 12 2015,positive,went in not expecting much especially after reading the critic reviews i was pleasantly surprised at how much i loved this movie
Feb 12 2015,negative,2 hours into the movie i was asking myselfwhen is something going to happenand then it ended  thats the problem with this movie it has no story arch its one giant introduction to the characters and despite the time allocated to introducing the characters you know nothing about them
Feb 12 2015,positive,awesome movie made for fans who are critics and haters nothing good or bad is all about personal tastes
Feb 12 2015,negative,ugggh thats the sound of disapproval not a ball gag her blindfolded scenes made me jealous easiest vday gift ever though
Feb 12 2015,positive,you have to have read the book in order to really enjoy the movie i did so i liked it jamie dornan and dakota johnson pulled it off
Feb 12 2015,negative,waste of time worst movie ever
Feb 12 2015,positive,they forgot to add actual content from the book in the movie
Feb 12 2015,negative,worst movie i have ever seen actually i didnt get to watch it all i was so bored i walked out of the cinema these two have no chemistry pathetic
Feb 12 2015,neutral,its done well  not cheesy but dull johnson especially and it stops in what seems like the middle of the book wait for it to come out on video
Feb 12 2015,positive,good movie i will say its unrealistic in everyday society as no one is a billionaire like grey  ive heard a lot of people say the ending was horrible but i thought it was pretty clever especially taking into consideration its the first of a few movies
Feb 12 2015,negative,please to god let this film bomb
Feb 12 2015,positive,couldnt have asked for more great girls night out movie
Feb 12 2015,positive,its identical to the book but i think its was missing narration
Feb 12 2015,negative,this movie adaptation of the first book from the blockbuster triology of the el james novels 50 shades of grey for me was 50 shades of what to do wrong in a book adaptation movie first let me express the artistic qualities in the movie and acting this movie exists only because of the succes from the book triology that was targeted for women over 30 years of age why then make a movie that is basically watching a twilight movie this will surely dissapointing for the novel fans i understand why they might get influenced from this vampire movie since both of them take place in seattle but you cant have a movie based on a novel for an audience of women over 30 or at least mature minded women over 20 watching the acting of the twilight saga with bad lines of bdsm o sadomasoquistic scenes which by the way this scenes have nothing of bdsm basically just nipple showing and bad acting the acting in my opinion was terrible the adaptation from the novel was horrible and i think i am not going to be the only one dissapointed in this movie i would only suggest this movies for girls from 18 to 21 years of age who are twilight fans since it seems more like a soft porn tv made movie than a box office hit

Feb 12 2015,positive,so awesome dont listen to critiques
Feb 12 2015,positive,much much better than the book i was pleased to find that i actually enjoyed the movie quite a bit dakota johnson is absolutely adorable
Feb 12 2015,positive,i loved itthere were some odd things but over all really good
Feb 12 2015,negative,hands down the worst movie ive ever seen im suprised dakota johnson still had a lip at the end of the movie with how much she was biting it
Feb 12 2015,negative,some good camera work during sex scenes but left out important details so did not do the book justice will not be seeing the sequels at all
Feb 12 2015,positive,got sucked in by all the hype not good lack of  chemistry between leads
Feb 12 2015,negative,having not read the book i came into the film without much expectation and was pleasantly surprised this isnt as bad as most of the critics out there will lead you to believe the story takes forever to get going wasting time with subplots that will never materialize so sorry to everyone in this movie other than christian and anastasia you were truly not needed their relationship as portrayed in the film is uneven at best given the contradictory nature of christians character which arise from the way he sees himself and the way hes shown to be anastasia on the other hand while not an interesting character in any way has a lot more definition the direction from sam taylorjohnson utilizes detail quite nicely but it does prove to be a one trick pony kind of visual style as the motifs tend to get overused thereby diluting their visual impact the acting is a little stiff but some scenes are rather effective and if not for a utter lack of vision in the storytelling the film could have actually been pretty good this is another film which suffers from sequelitis as its preordained to be a trilogy so those looking for some sort of closure will find none as the film ends on a cliffhanger the sex in the film is a little more extreme than usual but nothing unimaginable and pretty tame actually this was perhaps a point of contention as a r rating was achieved and eagle eyed viewers will note the places where cuts where mandated to keep the rating everything feels half done and half explored sometimes not even half almost like the people involved didnt know where to take the story so they just kind of did it in the least objectionable way possible which as it turns out forewent all the potentially interesting things and relied too heavily on the familiar in conclusion see it to believe it and after that ruminate on how it could have been better because despite what the majority might think these books could have produced a decent film
Feb 12 2015,negative,this film was ridiculous firstly the unhealthy emotional and physical abuse is sickening secondly  there was no plot where was the conflict from outside characters what was the point in going to georgia nothing i want my money back disgusting
Feb 12 2015,negative,i saw this movie at a special showing on feb 11th and it was not worth it  the acting was mediocre at best and the storyline was too slow and unrealistic  wont be paying to see the next two books  if they bother to make sequels
Feb 12 2015,positive,although the actors could have been a little more trained i personally loved it some parts are different from the book as you would expect it but elegantly performed two thumbs up cant wait for the next one
Feb 12 2015,positive,i never wanted to read the books but i saw the movie fifty shades of grey is twilight without the religious crap sorry to say but the relationships in twilight didnt feel genuine or plausible  supernatural aspects aside  and thank goodness she doesnt wait four books to put out the film is sensual not sexual even thought there are boobs bushes and fucking in it its a bdsm love story that reeks of teenage drama and desperation but its still fun to watch what does that say about    sam taylorjohnson delivered a tasteful movie despite the dicey subject fifty shades is well shot the cinematography is beautiful and luminescent  sorry about that word  literally bringing to light bdsm practices she suggested sex without showing it to be honest she showed quite a bit but once again the movie is sensual and not arousing  at least it didnt arouse me taylorjohnson also got some pretty surprising performances out of her actors jaime dornan and dakota johnson were surprisingly very good    jamie dornan is exceedingly good in this role not that he is a bad actor but i wasnt sure he could pull it off he does though he plays mysterious and domination well and also clearly shows how christian grey loves the crack the whip dakota johnson as the young and innocent bella i mean anastasia is brilliant she probably would have been a better bella than kristen stewart  sorry but its kind of true      i hope dakota johnson had a hell of a pay day out of this movie because however tasteful it is shes naked a lot in this film    chessy dialogues and unnecessary inuendos aside fifty shades of grey is not that bad    wornoutspines
Feb 12 2015,positive,worth seeing even once
Feb 12 2015,negative,it would be redundant to say that its better than the book because literally everything that exists is better than the book
Feb 12 2015,negative,not really a lot to say i do not recommend it
Feb 12 2015,positive,sam taylorjohnsons film version is neither as bad as it could have been nor as good as it needs to be
Feb 12 2015,neutral,the actors manage rare moments of life in these characters that gradually have you invested in them despite the lack of plot and some very cringe worthy moments it struggles to find the sweet spot between tasteful and bland erotica with sex scenes often with misstepped music supporting that are quite tamed considering in the end i couldnt help but feel this movie should have remained a standalone with regards to that ending and instead explored anastasias new exploration of her sexuality growth as a character there is a little believe it or not a very little and finally her escape of the mummyissue sociopath christian  instead were left thinking is that all we were finally getting into the character developmentplot after how long of just really and this how it ends if they had altered the subject and given it more arcs in regarding the above instead of a halfbaked love story that ending could have been powerful  instead were left feeling ripped off    so all in all one to see in the cinema with the right friends without that atmosphere it may loose the little charm it has with all its faults i will see the apparent next one with friends at the cinema because i love a good laugh
Feb 12 2015,negative,shit thats all what i can say
Feb 12 2015,positive,so much hype so much anticipation and yet fifty shades almost surprisingly so actually stands on its own two feet in fact as a reader of the books who found them reasonably enjoyable i admittedly loved this film adaptation johnson is truly a star transforming into anastasia and delivering such a natural and genuine performance complemented by dornan who manages to fit the elusive greys shoes theres an honesty to their chemistry created by witty dialogue and humorous banter that had me giggling constantly throughout but perhaps most importantly the sex scenes and subject matter is handled so delicately and so perfectly humour planted in the perfect spots yet avoiding any sense of comical and creating the perfect amount of sexiness i took my man along and even he claimed it wasnt as bad as he thought it was going to be and was actually alright fifty shades is sultry sexy and yet at its heart it portrays quite a sweet atypical love story
Feb 12 2015,negative,just glad the release date is finally here so we can stop seeing the teasers
Feb 12 2015,positive,i loved this movie stayed true to the book i loved jamie as christian and i loved dakota as ana it made me laugh cry it was enthralling and entertaining i cant wait to see it again and definitely cant wait for the next one
Feb 12 2015,positive,alrighty yep reviews inaccurate and sadly it appears to be the male species to a large extent that have contributed their 2 cents worth but then again this book was never for them really no romance novel would get them on a deeper level anyway and they would no sooner watch porn instead lol the simplest way i can put this is  screw the haters ever since the books came out people have labeled it all sorts of things and sadly i didnt expect much less from the movie i would rate it an 8 for the director trying to bring the book as close as they could to life on the big screen the actors tried their very best to live up to grey and steele so i give them a 10 for effort being a fan thats read the books twice over i can tell you i loved watching it come to life on the big screen my only negative comment would be that it felt a bit rushed and they should not have omitted parts of the book re christian cmon lets face itno one would be a match in my books  so good effort jamie the movie  brought comedy pain lust sex and sass to the big screen i personally know of men who have read it and secretly have used the book to spice up their sensual prose so they can deny it all they want but we know better lol there my thoughts on it n advice for fans  ignore the hatersagain i say just like other books that have made movies they can never be the same so people need to get over that expectation and just take it as another erotic funny and sexy movie like so many others out there the book and now the movie has lost its appeal due to the hype and everyone hating the book since it came out not a fan dont read it and dont watch the movie simple nobody forcing anyone to do anything they dont want to here but if u want in then just hush up and appreciate a book written well actors that have tried to duplicate the characters best they could and the director who tried to bring the book to movie best they could my postreview comments for those who care to read
Feb 12 2015,negative,fifty shades of grey is a genius book written by el james who was a fan of the horrible written twilight series she wrote the book in the same format just like twilight and now we have our story this movie is just the same as twilight with the dialogue and plot a love triangle with more hard core sex and whips and chains that will make catwoman look like childs play this concerns me about society its almost like we have become so dumb now let me start off with this the movie does have so hard core porn nudity in it but it doesnt pay off with characters the main actress is actually fine but its like she never goes anywhere as a person and becomes just like every stupid woman who needs a man in her life to save her from something i would have been fine with the film if they didnt do that how many times must you go to a film and you have a woman acting stupid and always needing a man it was so cliché and mr grey is very stiff and wooden pun intended as a character this movie is so bad that its funny and kind of sad that as a society we have just gotten dumb now the bdsm part was actually fun to me because its fresh for the audiences today who act like they dont do that kind of stuff at home it was just the fact that the movie gave ms steel no arch she didnt become strong i would have believed it more if she became more like him and being more into sm and liked it and felt free and didnt depend on a rich man to save the day its just stupid and it makes you think how most people get around in the world and how to make money just do what ever a rich man says or like the writer of this book did copy from another shiy book and make more money then you could ever imagine its no creativity in this society im done if you want to go see this movie fine but you might as well just watch so hard core porn because the sex scenes dont even pay off
Feb 12 2015,negative,like a tv series for housewife opened when they clean a room 
Feb 12 2015,negative,the problem with 50 shades of grey is that you cannot take the actors seriously in there roles theres no chemistry whatsoever and i felt like i was watching a bad high school play
Feb 12 2015,positive,intense romantic sensual erotic lots of nudity its an adult movie not as enveloping as the books but well made great casting every girl can only dream and would be very lucky to meet her christian grey ending is quite sudden and not satisfying as it leaves you hanging for much more and we have to wait for so long i guess well have to be patient hoping the pleasure of satisfaction will be intensified
Feb 12 2015,positive,the sex scenes work but the rest of the movie makes sex appear as if a  nightmare the characters are vague bores the situations they find  themselves in are absurd and above all this is just an ugly movie about  terrible people who in the hell thought this was a romance    read full review at      thanks
Feb 12 2015,negative,2 hours of softcore porn
Feb 12 2015,negative,a movie that glamorizes violence within the context of love is not a movie worth seeing this promulgates false ideas that a lover can change an abuser creating a culture accepting of lies that lead to dangerous outcomes for victims of sexual violence way to go shmucks glamorize abuse all day
Feb 12 2015,negative,    onethird of subjects read fifty shades 186 or 122655 read all three novels and 148 or 97655 read at least the first novel but not all three in age and raceadjusted models compared with nonreaders females who read at least the first novel but not all three were more likely than nonreaders to have had during their lifetime a partner who shouted yelled or swore at them relative risk rr125 and who delivered unwanted callstext messages rr134 they were also more likely to report fasting rr180 and using diet aids rr177 at some point during their lifetime compared with nonreaders females who read all three novels were more likely to report binge drinking in the last month rr165 and to report using diet aids rr165 and having five or more intercourse partners during their lifetime rr163
Feb 12 2015,positive,better than i thought but perhaps some things are better left in imagination like the soundtrack though
Feb 12 2015,negative,to start off the books were pretty bad they had a lot of potential but el james is not an author she wrote this story as a twilight fanfiction and somehow got this book published and just changed the names of the characters the movie was boring and awkward dakota johnson was lovely jamie dornan was not developed into a broken man as he is portrayed in the book there is a lack of character development with christian grey and a lack of chemistry between both actors maybe because jamie dornan is married he didnt fully commit to the role they could have found an actor who could really let go and could have developed christian grey so much more what a disappointment the books and movie had so much potential to be great if you enjoyed the premise of the books check out bared to you by sylvia day such a great book by a real author
Feb 12 2015,negative,dornan will be found out sooner rather than later basically he cant act
Feb 12 2015,positive,for reading the entire 50 shades of grey series twice i was pleasantly surprised with the outcome of the movie obviously the books are much more detailed and all around a better story i felt as though the movie came pretty damn close to the fantasy made up in my mind while reading the series   bravo to dakota johnson in this film she certainly played the part well id say this is her best film yet   jamie dornan yummy of course i was disappointed when charlie hunnam tuned down the part but i must say jamie dornan played the part pretty well at times you i could tell he had an accent in my opinion the christian grey would have been a whole lot sexier with jamie dornans fabulous irish accent but for the most part covered it up well    would gladly see this movie again while in theaters the film exceeded my expectations by a lot i was expecting to hate the movie compared to the book glad this wasnt the case this will definitely be going into my movie collection
Feb 12 2015,positive,comparison must happen if you have seen  shainbergs secretary and von triers nymphomaniac where blood really sheds on the screen  it occurred to me that sm stories from male  female perspectives are completely different  well mrchristian grey seems to be a fake dominant or too sweet for submissive   cannot really conclude here the movie did not end the story    ps cinema properly checked my id today  yayyy proper system for thailand
Feb 12 2015,negative,that was a waste of my time it was such a bad movie
Feb 12 2015,neutral,50 shades was tasteful but didnt leave me 100 satisfied anastacia was cast brilliantly but wasnt confident in casting jamie dornan as christian grey and was frequently frustrated by his performance they styling and cinematic detail was on point in fitting in the allure 50 shades offered maybe the sequel will be better i know there is a lot of hype but i will tell you its not something you must see at the movies
Feb 12 2015,negative,utter trash i cant imagine how bad the book is
Feb 12 2015,positive,one for dornan cause he is better looking than pattinson one for dakota cause she is a better actress than stewart one for the distributing team the book sucks the film sucks but somehow they just gave me such a good expectation
Feb 12 2015,positive,fifty shades of grey was a peasant surprise and i liked it the movie both improved on the book which ive read all 3 nearly 3 years ago yet remained faithful to it the writing was much better than the book with no use of oh my or inner goddess and excellent usage of laters baby the movie was actually intentionally funny despite its subject matter and had its intense moments particularly at the end going into it you should already know what to expect i watched it at powerplant mall here in the philippines where there were disclaimers posted at the ticket booths at the posters and at each cinema warning you about the subject matter of the movie so dont watch it and come out being offended it was definitely graphic and bordering on pornographic but there were blurs and numerous huge distracting screen blocks black spots to keep the rating at r18 all of which were actually introduced by the films producer rather than mtrcb the local ratings board prior to seeing the movie i was skeptical on the casting of dakota johnson as anastasia steele and all for jamie dornan as christian grey particuarly because of his shorllived but memorable role as the sheriff in once upon a time however after seeing the movie dakota johnson was spectacular and gave a bold and authentic performance while jamie dornan fell a bit flat although he certainly fulfills the aesthetic requirement of being christian grey another standout in the movie is its soundtrack with contributions from numerous artists including ellie goulding with catchy songs that fit appropriately into the mood of the movie overall fifty shades of grey certainly isnt for everyone especially those who have delicate sensibilities or moral objections but if you liked the books chances are you would most likely enjoy the movie as well
Feb 12 2015,negative,hot middles please my eyeballs demand them 
Feb 12 2015,neutral,after the scathing review this morning by lisa wilkins after i had already paid for my movie tickets on line i went along with missed emotions to see this movie  i also had not read the book  i have to say i didnt think it was as  bad as the critics have posted and keeping an open mind to see what all the hoo haa was about
Feb 12 2015,positive,i loved it i love the books i love the movie i cant wait for the next one i thought the cast was extremely well selected the cinematography was beautiful im getting ready to purchase the soundtrack from amazon i go to the movies to escape the routine of my daily life for two hours tonight i got to live in the fantasy world of fifty shades
Feb 12 2015,negative,a star for the effort in acting half taken away for murdering the lines from the book which btw was awful in the first place i laughed through out most of it all especially the intense sex scenes yes it was that awful
Feb 12 2015,positive,firstly i would like to point out that the myth that the book is always better than the film adaptation is correct with the exception of this miraculous work of art  during the 2 hour movie i noticed that although the story and dialogue stayed relatively the same compared to the book the interactions between christian and anastasia such as their tone of voice managed to convey a completely different message to the audience christian is portrayed as a slightly more timid person than illustrated in the book while anastasia seems bolder although these changes may have been a flaw in the actor and actress performance i believe it may have been deliberate as to show that although the books message may have been that males are dominating the female population both sexually and in the social hierarchy females can also be dominant in relationships along with the facial expressions this film expresses the idea of humans insatiable lustgreed and temptation when it is at their own peril   additionally the scenes including the much anticipated sex could be translated as a metaphor for humanitys greed and blindness in the site of their own desires      overall the film was able to consider several unseen themes in the book and was able to give the audience a refreshing perspective of what this controversial novel is about    congratulations are in need for jamie dornan and dakota johnson who were portrayed as christian grey and anastasia steele respectively due to their superb interpretation of the books darker themes if it werent for these specific people then i wouldnt be able to be so impressed their performance was able to let the audience look past the sex scenes and concentrate and wonder what the characters were thinking in the situations they were thrown in and how they would act  highly recommended for those who find a pleasure in viewing films that explore difficult real life problems
Feb 12 2015,negative,it can be said without a doubt that if you take away all movies featuring superheroes jedis or postapocalyptic rebels the most anticipated movie of 2015 has been the adaptation of el james fifty shades of grey this book which has taken the world by storm and titillated more middleaged women than a young brad pitt has generated so much interest on its journey to becoming a film that it is expected to break box office records all over the place this weekend    but before i move on to sharing my feelings on the films quality i should probably come clean on how im approaching it i have never read the book i have no intention of ever reading the book in fact all i really knew about the plot going into it was that it was about a ridiculously handsome man who happens to be into all sorts of kinky sex as a result my reaction here is about the film and only the film those of you looking for comparisons to the book will have to look elsewhere    leading me into the movie of course was the protagonist with the discarded bond girl name of anastasia steele played by dakota johnson and although johnson doesnt convincingly look like a young woman just graduating from college she actually ends up being the films strongest asset with a nice mixture of humor and compassion that make her an ideal leading lady    through johnson we experience anastasias first encounter with the mysterious christian grey played by jamie dornan when she takes her roommates place interviewing him for the college newspaper grey with his impeccable business suit and pretty boy looks makes an immediate impression on anastasia but the attraction is a surprising twoway street grey soon begins popping up in anastasias life in a notsoborderline creepy way in an attempt to woo herin his own weird kinda way    anastasia who is a virgin that works at a hardware store and still uses a flip phone is naturally swept away by christian greys lavish lifestyle but not everything is as perfect as she might hope when she learns that the dashing mr grey isnt exactly into cuddling    in fact hed rather whip her    and hes got a whole special play room for it to boot and when anastasia first enters this play room she knows that this aint no normal courtship grey has no interest in doing dinner and a movie instead he wants anastasia to sign a contract agreeing to be the submissive to his dominant in other words he wants to be able to do anything to her and what does she get out of the deal according to him me how charming    like any good hardware storeworking virgin anastasia is leery about entering mr greys kinky world but the two clearly have a strong connection and when she tries to resist it only makes him try harder and that pretty much sums up the rest of the movie anastasia tries to resist grey breaks his no romance policy to woo her and she relents enough to let him try some of his sm moves on her she then resists again and starts the process over    the repetitive nature of the story might work for those who are only there to see the increasing intensity of greys adventures in bondage but everyone else is likely to find the cat and mouse game between the two lovers dull and frustrating it eventually gets to a point where you have to question the judgement of anastasia who keeps running back to a man who clearly has little interest in ever putting her desires over his own and repeatedly shows up whenever and wherever he wants against her wishes its not cool    the film itself is competently shot and put together but what really kills it is a wretched screenplay filled with laughterinducing lines that had the audience i watched it with cackling at every turn johnson manages to navigate most of the clunky lines but poor dornan is crushed under the weight of bad writing on every page the unintentional comedy is only amplified on his part though thanks to his attempt to make every line reading ooze with sexuality which only succeeds in making him sound ridiculous 90 of the time he may look good enough to make you consider letting him beat you but that can only get him so far    the giggles induced by the film are then only enhanced by a horribly cheesy score by the usually reliable danny elfman and a selection of pop songs that will date this film in painfully record time    and so with a wonky script bad music a laughtercausing leading man and an obnoxiously repetitive storyline fifty shades of grey is almost impossible to recommend unless youre looking to poke fun at something for a couple of hours even the muchtouted sex scenes were nothing to write home about so now that its over all i can wonder is are there really four more hours of this to come
Feb 11 2015,positive,its going to be a great comedy
Feb 11 2015,negative,this is the sickest thing ive ever seen   stupid story useless acting discussing concept
Feb 11 2015,positive,i read all 3 books so i was very excited to have such a good read be picked up to become a film a movie is never as good as a book because there is just far too much detail to cover in a 225hr movie with that being said the movie stayed true to the plot dakota and jamie have great chemistry i held my breath felt emotional and was flushed i personally think its getting bad reviews because 1 people didnt read the books and 2 the horny housewives wanted a feature film that was xrated lol it just isnt going to happen i give it 354 stars and im sure part 2 will be much better
Feb 11 2015,negative,twilight with soft pornsame crap is on hbo  showtime  virgin has sex and likes itwants more but he doesnt want her tangled in his twisted life  blah blah blah and life goes on sadly in three seperate films
Feb 11 2015,negative,remember when softcore porn was left for cable television those were the days
Feb 11 2015,negative, the ending is just like the cliffhanger at the end of catching fire    you wish you silly audience member yes the ending to this was a total headshaker but in no way does it measure up to the glory of catching fire as a whole the movie consisted of awkward stiff cheesy dialogue just like the poorly written book unintentionally hilarious moments  some intentional ones  a great soundtrack esp queen bs tracks no clue why anybody would want anything to do with mr grey cuz hes cray and those steamy moments tho no comment hahaha thats what you wanted to hear about right was there even a climax i dont even know if there was it was definitely underwhelming dakota johnson always knows how to play quirky funny and oblivious to her own beauty and jamie dornans piercing eyes too bad they dont make up for this movie though
Feb 11 2015,positive,great love story intriguing to find out if the movie can really show how she changes him
Feb 11 2015,negative,i dont like it and i willnt be seen the other two movies
Feb 11 2015,negative,now im having second thoughts
Feb 11 2015,positive,clearly much ado has been made about this highly anticipated movie and it is extremely unlikely that anything i write here will convince anyone to either view it or not view it based on your prior predilections i would imagine that if you are a person who abhors the subject matter or has deep convictions you may abstain from seeing it on the other hand if you have been anticipating this film like the naughty little minx that you are then you will no doubt rush out to view it   either way it is an interesting adaptation or initial exploration of the subject matter a lot of people i know will no doubt say whats the big deal or that was rather tame  no judgements   having never read the books i cant make comparisons of any sort i liked the story and the psychological mind games in the story  after all who is changing whom i think it will be a huge hit
Feb 11 2015,negative,had a free screening ticket he stalks her tracks her phone takes her to his house and undresses her when she is too drunk to give consent and ignores her when she uses her safeword i left early annoyed disgusted and disappointed i actually thought the book was sort of entertaining
Feb 11 2015,positive,gray is part of life and life has many shades
Feb 11 2015,negative,havent seen it dont intend to from what i know theyve watered it down so much you can watch stuff like this online for free in my opinion
Feb 11 2015,positive,if you loved the books youll like the movie
Feb 11 2015,positive,amazing cant wait for the next one
Feb 11 2015,positive,i was worried in the first 10minsnot sure it was going to workbut slowly the movie grew on meis there sex yesbdsm yeslight versionbut the true story is the need for each of them to understand each otherevolvethis is what i love about the movieand okthe other scenes too p now time to go back and re read the book
Feb 11 2015,negative,poorlyscripted poorlyacted and poorlydirected film based on a poorlywritten novel  that is all
Feb 11 2015,positive,who really cares what i think i loved it and i want scratch that need more thank you dakota and jamie for bringing ana and christian to life teamanaandchristian teamdakotaandjamie
Feb 11 2015,positive,love the movie and christian greys character cant wait for more
Feb 11 2015,positive,it was good a lot of sex best part lol
Feb 11 2015,negative,the chemistry between anastasia and christian was not believable  it seemed as if they were acting
Feb 11 2015,negative,i going to say 3 positives about this movie i like how this movie looks i like the music i like dakota johnson thatsit the film adaption of the erotic novel which originated as twilight fan fiction written on a blackberry is no surprise one of the worst films ever made i had to watch this movie in 15 minute intervals it defines boredom even the sex scenes lack substance if you want the real deal just look up a porn parody hell even the acting in those are better mr grey here is played by a calvin klein model and emotes like a bare wall there is no reason for this poor girl to keep coming back to him she is one of the worst written female characters ever the film promotes abusive relationships and horribly depicts bdsm yet this film made half a billion dollars and 2 more are on the way the fact this has a fanbase this strong is repulsive and sickening
Feb 11 2015,positive,it was a lot better than everyone is saying it is i liked it
Feb 11 2015,positive,if people would simply just call this kinky porn with a good back story then everything would be just fine its not bdsm its soft porn plain and simple and for porn its good
Feb 11 2015,negative,this is neither erotic nor action nor its so pale in comparison to the book dakota is acting pretty good while he is just not for the big screen must see movie because of the all hype but youll surely walk out disappointed 
Feb 11 2015,positive,the movie was great  fifty team did a great job  they stayed true to the story  the chemistry between dakota and jamie was phenomenal we already saw that from the interviews  but as ana and christian they rocked  cant wait for fifty shades darker
Feb 11 2015,negative,fifty shades of lame  getting bad reviews
Feb 11 2015,positive,i thought it was a very good representation of the book i hope they do the other two books as movies as well
Feb 11 2015,negative,horrible portrayal of stalking manipulation intimidation and abuse as romantic devotion
Feb 11 2015,negative,sometimes boring other times unintentionally funny fifty shades is pretty bad in any form you put it in
Feb 11 2015,positive,johnson did a great job of acting as ana just wish the male to be a stronger character
Feb 11 2015,positive,everybody is going to debate this until the cows come home just like they did for the books i definitely wouldnt recommend it to anyone under 18 years old but if you read the books the movie will not shock you they watered down all the sex but it stayed true to the feel of the book with one exception the movie characterized ana far better than the book she is a true heroine and often very funny and relatable dont pay much attention to the high opinion of the critics this movie was never meant to impress them  if youre looking for a fun sexy little night out dont be embarrassed to give this movie a shot it might impress you
Feb 11 2015,negative,it feels like a high production cinemax movie with less nudity more comedy than romance more awkwardness than erotica
Feb 11 2015,negative,the chemistry quickly gets boring and nothing new happens the whole pointconflict of the movie is getting her to sign a contract this is kinda unexciting sex scenes are a total letdown built with shady closeups ultra shallow focus and backlit  go figure whats going on if anything the endless parade of macbooks iphones planes helicopters fast cars is also very annoying and shallow   beyonces cover is seriously the best thing and piece of art that happened to this movie
Feb 11 2015,positive,ladies start your engines this is the perfect girls night home movie party warning to you guys if your lady goes out with the girls to see this one when she comes home be ready for a long discussion or a short session of showandtell put away the mms they might melt i liked the tongueincheek humor yes pun intended shame on me yes i deserve a spanking
Feb 11 2015,positive,i thought it was interestingkept me intrigued could have explained more but if there is a sequel then i understand why they didnt the soundtrack music was great
Feb 11 2015,negative,disgusting unoriginal and blatantly annoying  50 shades of grey offers a character study without any actual characters to study leaving us with nothing short of a softcore porno
Feb 11 2015,negative,what the hell was that
Feb 11 2015,negative,i have more chemistry with my cat then this entire movie i also spent the whole time thinking of who would be a better christian
Feb 11 2015,positive,loved this movie  sexy as hell a bit long but it was great from beginning to end
Feb 11 2015,neutral,the first half of film is ok but then its getting worse in the second half frankly this twilight thing is not my type also the miniboobs hang low
Feb 11 2015,positive,i thought it was done tastefully i was concerned itd be just a soft porn flic hopefully second part will be done just as well
Feb 11 2015,positive,it wasnt like the book but they did a really good job the actors were excelent in my opinion i really like the movie i could watch it again and again love it
Feb 11 2015,positive,i was kind of disappointed bout how the story was interpreted in the movie esp about removing the silver balls part wink and the censored scenes haha but i got to admit the characters are well played and uhm come on really jawdropping hahaha shetsss iykwim 
Feb 11 2015,positive,thankfully sexed down from the books and classed up as welli do like dakota as anastasia havent quite figured out if i like jamie as christianexcept for the ridiculous whooping yelling women in the audience grow up i enjoyed itglad i went to see itwill give it another watch on dvd
Feb 11 2015,negative,not as bad as i was expecting but still not very good mostly because its pretty much a nonstory nothing really happens   the acting is mediocre from the two mains but i dont necessarily blame them i think they were directed this way   dakota johnson has this ordinary girl next door thing going on which i like great little body on her too   the movie just ends and im not sure if i really care all that much about seeing the sequel
Feb 11 2015,negative,wtf i guess i shouldve read the books first so i had some idea about what the heck was going to happen with all the hype over how sexy this story was and how many women reported that reading these books reenergized their sex lives makes me wonder how many people have some outrageously kinky and somewhat disturbing sexual fantasies
Feb 11 2015,negative,you guys wanna know how bad this film is i couldnt even make it through the first 10 seconds the opening credits alone were a turnoff
Feb 11 2015,negative,weak acting     one would expect much sexier actors for this story     failure
Feb 11 2015,negative,50 shades of shit i only wish i could rate it lower
Feb 11 2015,negative,one of the worst movie ever
Feb 11 2015,positive,its like watching pornography on a big screen with two beautiful actor and actress but as a girl i kinda enjoy it though its ending sucks
Feb 11 2015,positive,it was very well made i dont understand what people are fussing about its like the book the actors are good
Feb 10 2015,negative,a total fail     1 the script was a total disaster i am not one of those people that requires a movie to faithfully reproduce the book for me to enjoy the film but i do expect the movie to capture the essence of the book this script didnt even come close   contrary to what one might think adapting good erotica for the big screen can be and has been done very well does anyone remember how good 9 and a half weeks was that movie helped make mikey rourke and kim bassinger famous and the book was just pure intense erotica  but the script really needs to capture what is hot about the book and convey that in some way on the screen and this script just did not do that at all  this adaptation was just a botched choppy mess    2 jamie dornan can not act he was horrible even though the story is told through the eyes of ana it is all about christian  i knew if they got him wrong the movie would bomb and he was all wrong they really needed an actor that even if he wasnt quite as pretty as the book description of christian he still had to ooze sexual magnetism and intensity  the late heath ledger is an example of a guy who was not pretty but was really hot and he could act they needed to find someone that every woman in the room would want to tie her up cuz he is just so freaking hypnotically sensual they failed with dornan    they are going to make their money off this movie as i cant imagine the budget was much with a cast full of unknown actors and no big special effects but if they make a stab at the sequels they really need to get dornan a lot of acting lessons  and a much better script writer
Feb 10 2015,positive,loved it now im reading the book   cant wait to see next movie
Feb 10 2015,positive,sexy funny and selfawarethe ultimate romance but what it got right the most is the complexity of man and the pain when we want to understand them the most
Feb 10 2015,negative,this movie looks like the cheap raunchy garbage from the 90s
Feb 10 2015,negative,now i see why people rated so low for this movie i think each scenechapter was shot well but as a whole it failed to combine all together well every transition of the time or scene seemed awkward overall it was boring even though some parts are very interesting and sexy i think they failed to pick the perfect math for the actor i dont think the actor describes grey from the book well the movie character looks more childish and like a playboy  the movie was so slow too no ups and downs hard to find its climax
Feb 10 2015,negative,terrible film it leaks twilight and the sex is just boring
Feb 10 2015,positive,do yourself a favor free your mind see it  i saw it loved it  have seen kinkier more explicit mainstream movies than this that have shown as much and more than 50 shades  and they are not trashed as porn by the media  50 shades is not porn by any stretch  beautifully done  amazed that this is causing such a scandal  its a passionate love story between consenting adults  my critique  while overall well done it was too short seemed be hurried at some parts  jamie and dakota were spot on  i frankly was worried about dakota  seeming naive enough  she did it without seeming cheesy  or obtuse  both are very gifted actors    now if theyll just let these two shine a little more in the next two installments  they can and will  i understand pacing but this directorstudio felt this was a brisk jog instead of walking through christian and anas courtship and it showed  there was more humor than the books could have should have capitalized on several other parts of the book that they didnt   example  christian gives ana a car  in the book kate looks at the car and tells ana hes an over the top bastard isnt he  but no the movie has kate telling ana something about being careful   also in the book christian mutters about anas vw being a death trap before he gets her a car  much missing including witcomic relief  considering all this still overall  well done a pleasant surprise  a gentleman sitting next to me thought it was an excellent interpretation of the book  my advice for the next two installments  dont skip the key parts of the book that add so much and capitalize on what the fans love  ie christian on finding out she was a virgin  it was like a high speed interpretation  i wanted what elj wrote his shock  his reaction  this was a key scene in the book  suddenly it was on to the next scene  next time ask a few fans who love the books to comment on the nearly finished product  well help with the nuances and subtle things that are missing because el james gave you the material  her writing was genius  the story is genius  and the love making and sex is a natural integral part of this story
Feb 10 2015,positive,awesome movie just like the books so sexy
Feb 10 2015,negative,i remember watching the naughty victorians way back in the 70s and that movie had more bdsm in it than this was more fun and had a better story  i expected more  this was like a white washed version and mr grey is about as appealing and exciting as a wet noodle i was not impressed
Feb 10 2015,positive,could have been better
Feb 10 2015,positive,i would see it again it was hot
Feb 10 2015,positive,the movie followed the book fairly well i felt though that the movie lacked punch it was more asking the lines of a b soft porn than an erotic love story
Feb 10 2015,negative,it was overrated overadvertised and not nearly as interesting nor spicy as one would think hubby  i went to see it and i was disappointed about how many 1517 year old kids were there on dates this made it uncomfortable and of course they would not stop talking laughing aloud for the last hour it was completely boring the lead young woman in this movie was naked 90 of the time and she wasnt beautiful her body was just thin not beautiful either christian grey wasnt handsome he did however have great abs this plot wasnt very good either wanted our  back prepaid for tickets on flixter but couldnt redeem them at theatre
Feb 10 2015,positive,it had my attention long the way until the end i was so mad
Feb 10 2015,positive,certainly not for everyone based on rating and content but it is an improvement over the book  the two leads do a very good job  it is unfortunate that the email exchanges werent given much screen time  in the book they forced elj to be concise  max martinis skills are wasted in this film  the last third of the film is rushed  a good candidate for streaming
Feb 10 2015,negative,id give it 0 stars if i could this is absolute filth and i seriously question the judgement of anyone who would watch it
Feb 10 2015,neutral,the movie have some glamour a good soundtrack some few good scenes but fifty shades of grey not justify all the hype behind it even with a cliche and poor story you need more than a romanceish and some sex scenes to make a provocative narrative
Feb 10 2015,positive,i liked the movie and cant wait for part 2 
Feb 10 2015,positive,i liked it both actors did a great job obviously the dude had mommie issues 
Feb 10 2015,negative,straight up garbage plus stupid ending this movie made me sleepy then spent 1150 to see it i need a refund
Feb 10 2015,negative,i thought there is depth and meaning in this movie but it turned out to be a very shallow and stupid one
Feb 10 2015,positive,i went into this movie with no expectations  i didnt even read the books i was very impressed with the film and character of christian grey he has some skeletons in that closet i was not expecting the physiological issues most reviews of the film led me to believe it was shallow smut if you are a deep thinker and see things differently than the average person think outside the box i think you will enjoy it too
Feb 10 2015,negative,abuse disguised as bdsm
Feb 10 2015,positive,sexy hot wild amazing exciting funny sad just whoa
Feb 10 2015,positive,obviously its not as good as the book i had a different thought as to who would be the best christian grey the chemistry between jamie and dakota wasnt good christian grey seemed rehearsed it tried its best to compliment the book but i do feel it did leave out a lot of important romantic parts that also played an important role in christian grey dakota played ana well and impressed me but again the chemistry wasnt what i expected im sure i will still buy the movie when released on dvd only cause im a true fifty shades fan
Feb 10 2015,negative,a boring and really bad movie no chemistry between the two main character the dialogues are so cheesy the plot is so silly the only good thing is the shots the shots are ok this is a bad movie based on a bad book which is a fanfiction of a bad book
Feb 10 2015,positive,no one is more surprised than i that this booktofilm adaptation is rather successful jamie dornan and dakota johnson immerse themselves in their respective roles as the jaded christian grey and the naive anastasia steele the controversy surrounding the material is not warranted here in fact the film seems to take a more feminist stance on the often taboo topic of consensual sex
Feb 10 2015,negative,i kinda watched it not the worst slightly entertaining but thought chemistry could of been wayy better not a fan of the dude and obviously the book is def way dirtier that chick is cute irl tho i watched her on jimmy fallon
Feb 9 2015,positive,it was really good but like always its hard to put a book into a movie and get it right for everyone
Feb 9 2015,positive,read the books before you judge i for one loved the castin gand how the actors portrayed their characters i though it was a great movie
Feb 9 2015,positive,didnt think i would say this but even though the book was not the best way written it sure did a better job than the movie i do contribute the low rating to the director my understanding was that she wanted to change a lot from what was on the book and for the little that remained such as the red room i am glad el james put her foot down the sex part didnt bother me as i knew it would not be as descriptive as the book but the scenes didnt flow right a lot of the good lines and interaction was missed and the moment a scene got good they ended leaving everyone hanging i think the actors chosen were fine and sure they were all nervous ie remember twilight in the beg but by the time red room scenes came to life they embraced i just wished they would change the director for future movies and keep more of the book details and story line
Feb 9 2015,positive,exotic yet cheesy fun
Feb 9 2015,positive,movie was okhated the ending
Feb 9 2015,positive,needed more character development didnt make sense without reading the book and wasnt near as provocative as it couldshould have been at the same time many elements were spot on
Feb 9 2015,negative,with a outrageously horrible script dakota johnson puts in a decent effort and tries her best to save this movie but much like the real christian grey nothing can save this movie from itself the lines are so overthetop that only michael douglas could deliver them effectively jamie dornan is no michael douglas
Feb 9 2015,positive,girls are going to love it guys are bound to detest it the story is good but not much else i dont believe these two have chemistry at all oddly enough
Feb 9 2015,positive,i liked it maybe its the freak inme lol
Feb 9 2015,negative,i loved the book but this this was terrible they strayed so far from the book you wouldnt even know it was the same thing if it wasnt for the title grr however maybe i would have enjoyed it if i didnt know the book but now ill never know
Feb 9 2015,positive,they left out the story line the sex could have been more tastefully done it felt more like porn than a romance
Feb 9 2015,positive,absolutely loved it great for being as close as it could be with an r rating cant wait till next book movie 
Feb 9 2015,negative,ew how risque give me a break
Feb 9 2015,negative,saw it february 6 2015 at the today show premiere    eh its ok its cliffnotes of the first book bc they cant waste time with dialog and they have to get to the sex scenes because thats what majority of the people going to see this is in there for they made some slight changes with characters behavior anastasia isnt annoying and christan iswellchristian but 30 less creepy and abusive but still creepy he doesnt threaten to beat her every second but did the stalkerjealousy thing supporting characters are back decorations for the most part but to keep pace going theyre skimmed through the film you dont really get to know them other than thats their names and weve moved on to more flirting between ana and christian and christian making comments about ana being his and slapping that assor something  he literally shows up in one scene in her apartment out of nowhere and she doesnt even question it how did he get it when did he get a key to my new apartment i didnt tell you where i livedwtf did you break in just to have sex dudeboundaries damn it they did focus on comedy to make it not that awkward to watch haha its a nice little chuckles here n there the sex scenes are very explicit especially dakota johnson nude scenes jamie dornan who plays business billionaire christian grey only gives ass shots and a quick glance at just part of his dickpart of his dick no tip most likely its not even his probably james deens dick dakota is naked for most of the second n third act while her co star is just shirtless ugh that pissed me off a bit i do think jamie was miscast as grey he couldnt keep up with doing his american accent so sometimes grey is irish in the film dakota was kinda dry but i dont think thats her fault its just the script and what she was given really so was bella from twilight which is what anastasia was based off of  she was good at doing the comedy seemed like a different character when doing something funny shes a much better actor than this this isnt something people should run out to see this should be seen at home at 3 in the morning on cinemax its basically a softcore porno with hollywood money so the camera n lighting used is pretty good i dont need to or would want to watch this againunless im drunk andor high
Feb 9 2015,positive,i want the second movie but with more detail
Feb 9 2015,positive,i guess the book is more exciting  i should have read it
Feb 9 2015,positive,so true to the bookpeople can have opinions but to rate these things just because you hear and think its about abuse is absurdespecially if you havent even watched the movie or most importantly read the books it blows me away that you people waste your time just to rate it as low as possible when you have no interest in the booksmovie yes the movie has sex and has things that a lot of people wouldnt do in their personal life but that doesnt mean give false ratings and reviews about it regardless if you laugh at this or not the books are so much more than sex if you know nothing about the books aside from theres hardcore sex in the moviebook keep your idiotic comments to yourself because you look stupid when all you have to say is this is gross and sexual abuse you people act like this is condoning rape or murder everything and every single part of all three books is consensual everything
Feb 9 2015,positive,the book is way better the movie was moving too fast you have to have some background knowledge of the book to understand what is happening
Feb 9 2015,positive,they left out a lot from the book that would explain more of the story  im looking forward to the next one
Feb 9 2015,positive,seen it and it was better than the book so glad that jamie got casted instead of anyone else dakota was much better than expected
Feb 9 2015,neutral,like most women who have read the book i was very excited to see this movie  it was oka five  i am disappointed at how tamehow conservative they made this movie considering the explicated sensuality of the poorly written yet  page   turning first novel  it followed the books premise and had humorous parts and a few raw scenes nothing compared to the book   for the diehard fans i say see it and decide for yourself  in my opinion the short untimely ending was annoying and yetit followed the first books ending  i believe they could have made it a little meatier and a little longer
Feb 9 2015,positive,i loved it i think people who havent read the books might not like it the first book does have a bad ending however if youve read the books and you know what happens next then i think youll like the movie they followed the book pretty spot on i think the actress who played anna really captured the character
Feb 9 2015,negative,the funniest film of 2015 poorly acted poorly edited and some of the most hilariously appalling dialogue ever uttered
Feb 8 2015,positive,was a pretty good choice
Feb 8 2015,neutral,surprising charm humor and much better dialogue helps prove that fifty shades works much better as a film than a book
Feb 8 2015,positive,for an erotic novel turned movie it really wasnt that bad
Feb 8 2015,negative,if you are looking for a movie this valentines day thats romantic and exciting you can do infinity better than this movie based on a sub par twilight fan fiction 50 shades of grey embodies many of the problems with hollywood today there is a misconception amongst the film community that if you are adapting a best selling book it will make gang busters forget that best selling book is a glorified abuse fest that is mediocre at best and forget that this film has had horrible production problems since its first day all it wants you to do is to take your money this valentines day before you realize the terrible mistake you just made   even the leading lady dakota johnson says i dont want my family to see the movie because its inappropriate or my brothers friends who i grew up with i think theyd be like blegh also theres part of me thats like i dont want anyone to see this movie  i say follow her words do not see this movie
Feb 8 2015,negative,3 words long dry boring
Feb 8 2015,negative,a sick twisted bondage masochism and domination film with a very weak plot based on a very poorly written and poorly rated novel  i have zero interest in seeing women demeaned  of course not one but two sequels are already in the works
Feb 8 2015,neutral,mediocre movie all around
Feb 8 2015,negative,while it tries its best to be slick and savvy it ended up being two hours of my life i wish i could get back
Feb 8 2015,positive,it was pretty good im not a sappy love story movie kinda girl  this wasnt so yea i liked it  i would love for them to continue with the rest of the movies
Feb 8 2015,positive,full review on dcfilmgirlcom
Feb 8 2015,positive,enjoyed the film didnt read the book but looked it up and researched it some things werent as accurate as well missed some important scenes but what was shown showed its full potential
Feb 8 2015,positive,loved it i cant wait till the next one comes out
Feb 8 2015,positive,it followed the book very well the chemistry that was conveyed in the book was also very well conveyed in the movie not one to take the kids to thats for sure
Feb 8 2015,negative,got a private veiwing was not a fan not recommended for family people it is the 1st porn i have ever seen let in the movie theater
Feb 8 2015,neutral,much like salted caramel ice cream fifty shades of grey is a guilty pleasure
Feb 8 2015,negative,so thats the movie   hey mr grey lets talk   no lets have sex  hey nice plane  can we talk  no lets have sex  can we now talk  no i need more sex  hey nice plane 2  let me try true bdsm  kk do you like this whip  lol jk bdsm sucks bye forever  end of movie
Feb 8 2015,negative,fifty shades of grey is bad as a romantic and even worst as a softcore porn film filled with dialogs that actually seems to be taken from the cheapest erotic films from the 90s and terrible unexplainable mistakes in the storyline it is one of the most boring films of the year and you wont actually see anything interesting happen in almost two hours of film
Feb 7 2015,positive,i enjoyed it but unfortunately they spent to much time building the moive up and by the time they got everything finally going they ended they only filmed half of the book what about christians exsubmissive that breaks in or the house in aspen or even the money ana gets for her car they cant honestly end the first movie like that unfortunately i feel as if they wont get to make another movie because of all these biased people and their bdsm is wrong crap etc
Feb 7 2015,positive,its less rough than the book and like it more but not enough to say i like the 50 shades series
Feb 7 2015,positive,the movie was funny and sexy i say 4 stars loved the book n loved the movie
Feb 7 2015,positive,as someone whos read the books i appreciated all the references made to part in the book but felt they were just thrown in there with no rhyme or reason its was much slower paced than expected and honestly felt a little bored with it lots of sex but pacing was all wrong compared to book
Feb 7 2015,positive,although it omitted too much from the book i still like it
Feb 7 2015,positive,i was able to see this at a free screening on february 7th and if any are like me who before i watched thought this movie wouldnt be worth the price of admission think again it was definitely entertaining i think the lead actors and director did a good job with the material sam taylorjohnson especially gets a lot of my respect because she did a great job with the steamy scenes i found myself clutching my pearls more than once and i mean that in the best way possible dakota johnson who i liked from her ben and kate days did a great job with the dialogue and character she did a bangup job with some of the more lighthearted scenes overall this is a must see i am a now a convert and will be going to see it again when it opens on the 13th this time ill pay full admission 
Feb 7 2015,neutral,fifty shades of grey can sometimes be so bad its good other times it is just bad dakota johnson is fine in the film but jamie dorman looks like he is trying to audition for twilight they dont really have chemistry some of the dialogue is laughable overall women will like it i didnt
Feb 7 2015,positive,beautifully shot captured the provocative romance in its entirety although jamie dornans accent was apparent and made his acting a bit stoic it was easy to appreciate all of the actors and the depth that they created with these characrters bravo
Feb 6 2015,positive,dakota was an excellent anastasia   christian could have been better  i liked the movie but i did not love it
Feb 6 2015,positive,the book was closely followed  the sex scenes were a little tame but it probably is what kept it from an nc17 rating   the couples were a good match physically with each other  if he would have spanked her with something a bit more exotic then it would have been more shocking  ill buy it on video when its released  johnson makes the character and is the true star of the show
Feb 6 2015,positive,just how i imagined itâtmâtmâtm must watch
Feb 6 2015,positive,was really surprised it was not as bad as all the reviews  if you read the books you would like the movie
Feb 6 2015,negative,i realize this is actually a high score but i cant help it i laughed so hard it was actually entertaining
Feb 6 2015,negative,an abused man that likes to abuse women not sexy or appealing dont bother going to see this movie had hoped for much better
Feb 6 2015,negative,ill give it some a for the sex scenes they did a spectacular job there but there was zero chemistry between the main characters and you could feel it made the more intimate moments seriously awkward
Feb 6 2015,positive,every bit up to the hype but this is not a story of sex but a story of power and control we saw it on its opening night and i have quite frankly never seen a cinema audience quite like it the women were terribly over the top like theyd never seen nudity before and the guys were just as bad but so glad we saw it
Feb 6 2015,negative,so bad that i found it amusing dont believe the hype
Feb 6 2015,positive,the actors played the role correctly and well it was exactly like the book does bdsm bother you dont watch it
Feb 6 2015,negative,anodyne fan fiction crap which could be summed up with these lines of dialogue  ana  christian  since youre a virgin would you like to sign a contract which allows me to fuck you whip you and occasionally take a shit on your face be warned though that if you say no im going to follow you everywhere until you say yes  will i get a valentines day card  i dont do that pathetic romance shit  then no  the end
Feb 6 2015,negative,mommy porn mixed with twilightdont waste the money
Feb 6 2015,positive,i was not expecting it to be this good they did an amazing job with it and wow jamie dornan praise
Feb 6 2015,neutral,couldve been better  the acting was a little dry in some places and there was an awkward chemistry between them which i understand but its still painfully obvious also the movie couldve been longer i felt like it was rushed and some important aspects of the book were left out never mentioned  hopefully the second movie which im sure theyll make will be better
Feb 5 2015,negative,to someone who read the book this probably should be a four starbut to methis is not really a movie
Feb 5 2015,positive,saw itliked it cant wait for the next one
Feb 5 2015,positive,omg loved itso wanna see it again 
Feb 5 2015,positive,a porno book turned into a movie now thats a first
Feb 5 2015,positive,a decent story a movie for the open minded and those who can enjoy not only social relationship exploration but also a plot thats deeper than just the images on the screen
Feb 5 2015,positive,the book is way better and they shouldnt have skipped over key things i am not sure that even want to see the next one the chemistry between those two was soooo uncomfortable
Feb 5 2015,neutral,the chemistry between the two actors was wayy off not really believable the actress who played anastasia did an amazing job
Feb 5 2015,negative,this film and book should in no way be a glorified as it it  christian grey is and his approach to bdsm is nothing short of a travesty  this film and book in no way represent bdsm or a ds relationship  in fact if he did the things he does in the book in real life he would be put in  prison  the book violates the most basic tenant of bdsm culture which is the motto  safe sane and consensual  there is nothing healthy about his actions or activities and i have been a professional bondage and fetish photographer for well over 10 years   in the book christian grey beats women because his mother was a crack whore  his distrust and hate of women is crystal clear as is the authors  again this book and anything involved with it are a travesty and should never have been made or released
Feb 5 2015,negative,wait on the boot leg dumasshell
Feb 5 2015,negative,fine i admit it i watched it it should be in discussion for one of the worst movies of all time it is straight garbo in every way possible i could have ranted for hours about how much i hated this movie 1 viewing
Feb 5 2015,positive,the script was blah but for the most part followed the book i totally loved it
Feb 5 2015,negative,dont know what all the fuss was about
Feb 5 2015,positive,this movie was in my opinion pretty well done in following the book yes the sex was cut down but it shows enough to get the idea of what el james had in mind jamie dornan and dakota johnson had a strong bond that could be seen in their acting jamie dornan shines as the tortured dominant fifty shades of fed up christian grey and dakota johnson brilliantly brought strong defiant submissive anastasia steele to lif great movie and music to accompany it to life anyone who says that they were wrong for the parts are mistaken
Feb 5 2015,negative,not even sure it deserved one star
Feb 5 2015,negative,it really wasnt that good the characters were definitely under developed
Feb 5 2015,positive,i honestly thought it was a great movie i loved the first book and the movie was spot  on with the book there was only a few parts they missed but overall i thought it was a great movie
Feb 4 2015,positive,im not sure why the critic ratings are so low it was a great movie a great adaptation of the booked turned into something real
Feb 4 2015,positive,ii loved it hope they make sequel
Feb 4 2015,positive,a little disappointed  but still one of my favorite stories the movie wasted tastefully for the big screen but the book wasnt about being tasteful haha
Feb 4 2015,positive,love it and will see it again  dakota johnson is the perfect anna  the movie obviously could not have every th ing the boom had but i felt they gave a descent and admirable spin on things
Feb 4 2015,positive,im giving four stars because i like the kinky shit
Feb 4 2015,positive,the acting isnt the best but it followed the book pretty well i wasnt happy with the choice in actors for the parts the goal of a movie is to entertain and it did  so make it a girls night and see the movie
Feb 4 2015,negative,this movie blowscant wait for the classless and pervs to be disappointed
Feb 4 2015,negative,spend the whole film waiting for it to get good it didnt
Feb 4 2015,positive,if you didnt read the books you might think the movie wasnt explicit enough however this movie is only about the first book and no matter how explicit the book might be people still seems to forget this is still a hollywood production and not a porn production so it wouldnt be like porn which is what everybody wants  no this is not a oscar worthy nominee   no this is not a family or a guys movie  its a chicks fantasy and a chicks flick   the books are great and the movie is good as well maybe one cheesy part here or there  laters baby
Feb 4 2015,positive,better then i expected 
Feb 4 2015,positive,unexpectedly better than i thought itd be i really enjoyed it steamy and intense this film has great performances all around and doesnt ever succumb to the ridiculous trash you assume it will become
Feb 4 2015,positive,read the books and saw the film and was disappointed
Feb 3 2015,positive,creative movie but not much inside it
Feb 3 2015,positive,really enjoyed this being a guy i dont see a lot of romance movies but i know its good when its engaging and you get those tingly things on top of that i thought they portrayed the abusiveness the dominantsubmissive part not the bdsm of the relationship well though it wasnt completely clear nor the goal of the film i enjoyed it the sex scenes are nothing beyond the usual hollywood format so its not porn as we all know and expect just thought id toss it in for those that need to know but yes it will arouse the average viewer and enrage the conservative and religious the acting was pretty decent in my opinion though some of the lines could have been perfected all around entertaining and worth the ticket price
Feb 3 2015,positive,how can this go wrong from a masterwork that should of won every book award
Feb 3 2015,negative,creepy and boring after it ended i caught the back end of a show about sheds and that was by far more interesting
Feb 3 2015,negative,horrible dont waste your money
Feb 2 2015,positive,followed the first book in trilogy pretty well enjoyed it
Feb 2 2015,positive,a great movie it could of had alittle bit more to it but it was just great cant wait until part 2 comes out 
Feb 2 2015,positive,amazed by how much i liked the movie since i have read the books follows storyline of book very well hot scenes for a theater setting although i was disappointed in the role cast of ana  christian  once the movie started they blended well for the roles will see again 4 12 stars due to the cast for sisterbrother 
Feb 2 2015,negative,seriously loved the book the movie left me wanting to walk out of the theater and it was mostly awkward i mean the characters were ok but not connected i will not be arching the other 2 ill stick to reading this series
Feb 2 2015,negative,this movie was way out of what was expected not worth the money i payed
Feb 2 2015,positive,i like it you cant compare to he book but whatever i loved it
Feb 2 2015,positive,stuck so close to the book  both jamie  dakota and the rest of the cast portrayed the characters from the book perfectly
Feb 1 2015,positive,the biggest surprise about the stylish big screen adaptation of el james kinky bestseller is how tame the whole affair is in fact while the film runs right at 2 hours only 20 minutes actually feature any onscreen sexual encounters the rest of the film is blazingly romantic nixing the graphic sexuality in favor of heated glances and longing embraces director samtaylor johnson also never takes the outrageously tacky source material too seriously injecting the love story with humorous moments and while some of the sexuality on screen might come off as bizarre the emphasis of romance over graphic bdsm leaves much to the imagination a tactic that somehow makes the film that much sexier
Feb 1 2015,negative,this movie will make alot of money but for all the wrong reasons
Feb 1 2015,positive,it was ok not quite the build up everyone says
Feb 1 2015,positive,watched this coz i wanted to see what all the fuss was about  not my sort of thing but i didnt thing the film was too bad
Feb 1 2015,positive,i enjoyed it though it was a little awkward watching the erotic scenes with a crowd
Feb 1 2015,negative,glad i didnt read the book 
Feb 1 2015,positive,even though there are a lot of parts missing from the book that you would think would be in the film it was amazing the major cliffhanger at the end makes meant to see the second one now
Jan 31 2015,positive,not my type of flim but i definitely enjoyed it
Jan 31 2015,negative,i feel like i should be refunded they hyped this movie up so much and this is what i get boring and the actors sucked ana looks like shes 40 years old and christian how about a recast for the both of them and the screen writer and producer if you do recast make sure the woman who plays ana shaves her legs next time   they cut out so many good parts of the book and rushed the whole movie im not sure if ill be watching the second movie
Jan 31 2015,positive,loved it followed the book very closely
Jan 31 2015,neutral,i myself did not read the books however speaking to others that have and that are fans i believe they would be happy with the film and score a much higher rating then i although i feel the movie was ok i dont think the director did enough for the nonreader  the casting for this film had mixed opinions i get not casting big names and was fine with both i honestly thought jamie was fantastic in the fall see netflix and was glad he got the role although for me it just missed a three star rating it did enough for me to look forward to the next chapterfilm
Jan 31 2015,positive,definitely better than the book they played down the creepiness of christian a fair bit left out certain details the soundtrack was really good there were a lot of points where it was really hard to take seriously which resulted in a lot of laughing the dialogue was also weird at times but those were the points when they were quoting the book certain parts such as the contract scene were really amusing to watch because it wasnt dialogue from the book it was either written in by the script writer or improvd it was also really funny how oblivious dakota played anastasia i would watch it again just for the humour aspect
Jan 31 2015,positive,fun but not as good as the book
Jan 31 2015,negative,ive seen better acting and storylines in porn
Jan 30 2015,positive,loved it it was as close as it could be to the book the actress who played anastasia did a great job she was silently strong with her words the acute who played christian did okay his deep voice helped him since he doesnt actually look like the book christian
Jan 30 2015,positive,i absolutely adored this movie i think that it was really good however i did like the humor the book had this movie doesnt have much of it i wish the movie could have been more intense like the book itself i liked it though
Jan 30 2015,positive,just saw it wasnt too bad very long movie had decent sex scenes and a bit of quirky humor to it stays true to the book definitely a girls movie but guys might still be interested in it for the fun
Jan 30 2015,positive,loved it so can not wait til the sequel comes out
Jan 30 2015,positive,it wasnt the ending i was expectingbut i liked how the two leads played off each other im sure a sequel is in the making and i cant wait for them to delve into mr grays psychosis a little more
Jan 30 2015,positive,despite the low expectations the movie does a good job of following book 1 to all the haters relax its just a film dont be so uptight
Jan 29 2015,positive,i actually enjoyed this film it was very parallel to the book cant wait til the next one
Jan 29 2015,neutral,lots of relationship matters going on in this movie it was alright o
Jan 29 2015,positive,people need to stop hating i had no interest in reading the book then decided to because i am a movie buff i thought the movie was greatthe entire first book was mainly focused on sex so to me they did an awesome job in translating that to the big screen i hope they make a part 2 and 3 because as you read further and get into the second book it becomes more about an adult relationship and the changes that people go threw being an adult the comedy in the book is very funny and the sex awesome no director could ever translate everything in a book onto the screen because you would have a 9hour movie they made the movie tasteful and classyso what if it is an unlikely story isnt that why you read things and watch movies in the first place to be transported to a fantasy or a deep desire i give it up because this woman right here throughly enjoyed it and hope to see the number 2 on its way lets keep our fingers crossed
Jan 29 2015,positive,i like itadaptation is gooda bit slopy but i can live with thati feel in love with the love storydidnt expect to much sex in it is good
Jan 28 2015,positive,the couple were perfect  cant wait for the next in series hope they dont take to long  didnt differ to much from book just the right amount so enjoy 
Jan 28 2015,negative,i was very anxious to see this movie but left disappointed i laughed the whole time couldnt take the movie seriously at all
Jan 28 2015,positive,totally awesome movie i cant wait until the next one
Jan 28 2015,positive,points for style points deducted for zero chemistry
Jan 27 2015,negative,dull rushed cornydramatic not sexy
Jan 27 2015,positive,great story gotta read the book now
Jan 27 2015,positive,i hate the ending huge cliff hanger
Jan 27 2015,positive,i thought that overall it followed the book well and i was generally pleased with the actors chosen im not sure why it received such terrible reviews
Jan 27 2015,positive,this was a not to be missed movie i read all of the books and was not at all disappointed in how it was brought to life can not wait for the next one  ââ      ââ  ââââ  
Jan 27 2015,positive,loved it did seem a bit rushed tho but overall it was good
Jan 27 2015,neutral,8815  i loved all the books i have even read grey already not been able to sit through this whole movie yet mr grey in my head is just so much better than this interpretation of him i do love the music ill see the second movie though cuz its gonna have charlize theron
Jan 27 2015,negative,this movie was just absolutely horrible horribly written horribly acted horribly edited and horribly directed dont waste your time
Jan 26 2015,negative,awful just rent a p o r n o if you want bdsm people
Jan 26 2015,positive,wow better than i ever could have imagined but i just want more
Jan 26 2015,positive,i really enjoyed the books and now the movie i think it is so much more than just the sex it is a love story about two people whose lives are forever changed girls will love it because it is romantic and although guys might not want to see the movie they will want to see what happens after the movie with their significant other
Jan 26 2015,neutral,did not follow the book really
Jan 26 2015,positive,the movie was an exceptional romance novel with a slight twist in the end you fall in love with the characters and feel bad for the wounded and troubled christian grey   dakota  johnson played ana very well i couldnt have pictured a better actress for the role although jaime dormans accent showed up a few times throughout the movie he could have worked better on that
Jan 26 2015,positive,i was expecting a disastrous film after seeing all the reviews i went to see 50 shades last night with my friends and we were all shocked at how much we enjoyed it  cant wait for the next 1 especially the way it ended
Jan 26 2015,positive,nothing on the book
Jan 26 2015,positive,although it leaves more questions unanswered than answers i was pleasantly surprised  if however the rest of the trilogy leaves open all these queries i will have to reevaluate my review  a selfmade millionaire meets cute an english lit major subbing for her journalism roommate  its like a harlequin version of a softcorn porn complete with ripe names like anastasia steele christian grey and katherine kavanagh  the ds scenes are much tamer than secretary a much better film about dominants and submissives
Jan 26 2015,positive,great movie and was true to the book
Jan 25 2015,positive,great movie just the right amount of steamy without sacrificing the plot
Jan 25 2015,positive,surprisingly not bad maybe because i havent read the books
Jan 25 2015,positive,perfect for tv left a lot to imagination
Jan 25 2015,positive,one of the best romance book to screen adaptation that will fulfill your bodies and hearts desire
Jan 25 2015,positive,bad bad bad  just as bad as the books
Jan 25 2015,positive,no i havent read the book so i was not biased going into the movie heres my take  very kinky and explicit in a tasteful way movie explores and portrays well greys deeper psychological problems that could not have been handledexplained any other way the story is well done but be prepared for very sexually explicit scenes keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time  not just the sexual scenes but more the deeper psychological side i wouldnt suggest this for anyone under 21
Jan 25 2015,positive,the movie captured the story line perfectly fifty shades of grey wasnt all about sex it was about christians lifestyle and what real love does to a person
Jan 25 2015,negative,went to see it just to see what all the fuss was about was not impressed in fact i felt angry about it
Jan 25 2015,positive,everyone needs to calm down the movie is exactly like the book there is no plot whoever read the book should know this i think they did the best they could with being consistent with the book the sex scenes were more pg13 than rated r i wish they got more intense with that aspect of it i personally liked it my boyfriend on the other hand was not a fan
Jan 25 2015,negative,the book was so much better
Jan 25 2015,positive,the film is made of awkward dialogues a strange chemistry between the main characters moments with too much and others with not enough and alright sex scenes and bdsms however i did get a good laugh at the twilight parallels
Jan 25 2015,neutral,the movie pretty much covered the main events in the book which was good i was disappointed they left out a few tidbits that i wouldve like to see on the big screen like christian speaking french with his sister or him showing up at anas apartment after receiving a text stating she was unhappy with him the actors captured the characters personalities well johnson added her own personal touch to her character making ana easy to love and want to relate to dornan did well in acting out the intensecold role of christian the sex scenes were sexy but brief so if youre hoping for the movie to linger on those scenes youll be disappointed the ending was swift like they were tired of editing so they were like lets just end it here and call it a day for some reason the ending of this movie reminded me of how the sopranos series ended overall i enjoyed the movie it was fun to see el james literary characters come to life
Jan 24 2015,negative,another movie that wasnt able to capture the details of the book and left more to be desired
Jan 24 2015,positive,the first 40 minutes or so is like you are watchingreading twilight without the vampire aspect of course you seehear mostly christian say the same lines that edward said is not such a bad thing if you liked twilight too but you can notice the similarities a lot after that is when it starts getting better because the story and the dialogue start to take its own form basically no more twilightedwardbella at least not that obvious i read these books so long ago that i cant remember much what things from the book were missing in the movie but i think the director taylorjohnson did a good job translating the essence of the book into film the casting was good i wasnt expecting much from christians character because he is very still in the first book you basically learn pretty much nothing about him in book 1 book 2 is a whole different thing for his character anastasias character on the other hand has more layers because she is a character that actually evolves in the first book dakota did an excellent job portraying her she delivered the lines so onpoint that i think she was definitely the best part of the movie acting wise she was very funny without seeming like she was trying to be and you actually buy her acting also i gotta give props to her for having the courage to lay it all there about the sexy kinky stuff it was definitely way more subtle than what you read in the book but again i was not expecting much because its a movie and there is only so much they can show and still keep it rated r plus lets face it its not meant to be a porn movie im pretty sure there will be a special unrated bluray edition nonetheless i think with what they show was enough for the viewer to understand what christian is about overall it was a good translation from the book and bottom line even if you havent read the book this is a love story so if you like romance movies this is one too watch even if its just out of curiosity ps about the abrupt ending i understand it because thats how each of the books ended leaving the reader in this case the viewer wanting to know what happens next
Jan 24 2015,positive,i loved it but i cryd a little but in what happind little in the end that happinds to every virgin how had there first time with a guy  think he should have love her back
Jan 24 2015,positive,i loved it i loved what sam did with it she kept all the important aspects which was ana and christians relationship i do wish that there was a little more dialogue but i am eagerly anticipating the second movie and i will be seeing this one again and again 
Jan 24 2015,negative,fifty shades of grey is not the movie to watch at all it has lots of porn and im surprised how hollywood has allowed this movie to be issued to the public the plot is very horrible and i was so confusedfifty shades of grey is only for people who want togo watch porn with their significant other
Jan 24 2015,positive,great movie  really close to the book 
Jan 23 2015,negative,the book was so much better
Jan 23 2015,positive,loved it start to end surprised how much more there was to the story than i thought might even read the next two books just to know what happens
Jan 23 2015,negative,fifty shades of gross
Jan 23 2015,positive,loved the movie it was exactly like the book honestly most books are much better than the film same goes for this one however i wanted this book to come to life you have to read the books to appreciate the movie if you havent read the book then you shouldnt be reviewing the movie loved it
Jan 23 2015,negative,the good   jamie dornans ass the bad  everything else
Jan 23 2015,negative,this movie is about as good as the books good storyline but seemed like it was written by a middleschooler
Jan 23 2015,negative,to call this trash a movie is an insult to moviesall of them
Jan 23 2015,negative,extremely disappointing i thought the books were written poorly and only read them to give me background before watching the films but i dare say i wont be watching the next two films if they ever reach prod whilst i like the two lead actors they have absolutely no chemistry together dornan unfortunately cannot hold himself with the steely charisma that grey is supposed to have and johnsons interpretation of ana is in my opinion too sassy smart assed and boldaggressive in some ways her character reads as shy meek inexperienced and battling a constant internal monologue of self doubt with grey but this is never conveyed   the first half of the film is spent slowly going through the motions of early encounters directly off the pages of the book  then the second half of the film is spent trying to play catch up to cram â 34 of the book into an hour it starts to skip over vital plot points as we know the storys plot is already lacklustre and feels really rushed towards the end at which point they end far more abruptly than the book and with absolutely no explanation which they do have in the book so i feel bad for those viewers who havent read the first book simply for the fact they will not have any understanding of the ending whatsoever   wouldve turned off in the first ten minutes if i hadnt already made the effort to read the trilogy already and wish i could get those cumulative 20 hours of my life back
Jan 23 2015,positive,from a film student point of view  it has major flaws from a fan point of view  im excited to see this book brought to the big screen  maybe a new director next timeone with more experience  new screenwriter and maybe some more commitment from the actors representing the characters and the next film will be much better
Jan 23 2015,negative,could have chosen a better male star for the role of christian grey didnt care for the movie at all
Jan 22 2015,positive,wish they kept the original cast
Jan 22 2015,neutral,this movie did not live up to the hype
Jan 22 2015,positive,this movie will leave you on the edge of your seat biting your lips all i can say is christian
Jan 22 2015,positive,ive always wanted to see this movie ive read the book and think it is amazing
Jan 22 2015,positive,better than expected
Jan 22 2015,positive,i went in with an open mind and i came out a happy lady after reading the books i thought it would be difficult to adapt into a film but i think it has been done well it was not distasteful it was quick paced and there were even a few giggle moments it was easy to watch and the ending was great left you wanting to see more i will be seeing it again
Jan 22 2015,positive,not as raunchy as i thought it should have been acting was okay grey was a little young to be intimidating and the story seems diluted fine for a pg13 movie r seemed pretty extreme saw more in eyes wide shut probably to hard on the movie considering it wasnt overly offensive which it could have been fine twisted love story but far fetched
Jan 22 2015,positive,i enjoyed watching this movie even though there were several dumb and annoying moments through out the movie im looking forward to the next one
Jan 21 2015,positive,dakota was awful as ana she was so giggly and smiled at inappropriate times she annoyed and irritated me through the whole movie  jamie as grey was perfect choice he played him completely on point of who christan is the problem with this is there was absolutely no chemistry between the two at all and the way the script was written made it seem completely and utterly out of order and the sex scenes were laughable and horribly directed as i am sitting here watching it again i cant get over the lack of chemistry between dakota and jamie how do you make a movie like this and miss the most important part chemistry at least twilight had chemistry
Jan 21 2015,positive,good overall experience i believe home depot will profit from the movie
Jan 21 2015,negative,too much story not enough pn know what im saying a little to soft core i got sick of staring into christians eyes i also wish he was a little bigger know what im saying this movie is morally ambiguous know what im saying barely got up know im saying
Jan 21 2015,positive,i had no expectations  i thought for sure the movie was going to bomb but i surprisingly liked it  at first i wasnt thrilled about the casting but now that ive seen the movie i think they did a good job portraying the characters  especially ana
Jan 21 2015,negative,terrible beyond description  better soft porn on hbo  better plots on lifetime
Jan 21 2015,negative,really disappointed there was more to this movie  they cut the most important parts of the book  i was so exited to watch the movie  hopefully the second movie is better 
Jan 21 2015,positive,i loved the movie they really did a great job transforming this book in a tasteful way jamie dornan isnt who i pictured but he did a good job in the role and is definitely hotter on screen dakota johnson completely became ana im so impressed with her acting in this other than the casting of rita ora as mia grey who thank god only had about a minute of air time and a few small moments being cut from the screenplay i was really happy with it they put the main focus on their love story rather than it being all about the sex the whole time and it was a smart choice for the movie
Jan 21 2015,positive,loved it cant wait for the next film
Jan 20 2015,negative,yknow fifty shades of gray was originally a fan fiction all the author did was change the names now its a movie pfft hahahahahahaha they hired real actors to be in this ahahahahahahahahaha people payed real money to see this in theaters ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha hehe heh ahem but seriously this movie was a horrible idea from the get go
Jan 20 2015,positive,not particularly about abuse nor anything negative a dark love story that will unfold with future installments
Jan 20 2015,positive,i love it but you have read the book to understand clearly the christian character
Jan 19 2015,positive,okay loved the movie exactly like the book i am not sure why the bad reviews maybe some people need to read it again
Jan 19 2015,positive,oh my god love it great job also everyone us entitled to there own opinion but great movie loved it and would watch it 20 more times just for fun
Jan 19 2015,negative,rather boring i really didnt expect a cliffhanger either
Jan 19 2015,positive,very good cant wait for the next one
Jan 19 2015,positive,nothing like the book it was a good movie but wasnt really worth all of the hype
Jan 18 2015,positive,the ending was soooooooo oainful to watch lol like u jus wonder  but thats good
Jan 18 2015,negative,please im begging you dont make a sequel this movie has pathetic dialogue acting and plot i couldnt finish the book because it was so bad it made my teeth hurt if readers digest is written on a 5th grade level this is written for people who are illiterate with bad taste and poor judgment the movie is worse because it cost more money stop seeing this movie because the more money it makes it will be harder to make it go away and once you see it it cant be unseen
Jan 18 2015,positive,soooo good   cant wait for number two i would give 10 stars if i could great movie and a must see
Jan 18 2015,positive,i thought it was a good movie it was exactly like book
Jan 18 2015,positive,i enjoyed the movie  would never go to theater to watch  this is an at home movie only
Jan 18 2015,positive,i loved the books and was very curious to see how theyd make it into a movie  i can say that i was pleasantly surprised how well it was made  the casting was perfect for anastasia and christian  they fit the parts perfectly  it was tastefully done leaving you wanting to see the next one
Jan 18 2015,positive,not as exciting as the hype for this movie but still fifty shades of grey is as decent and humorous as its book counterpart
Jan 18 2015,negative,fifty shades of grey is just very odd too me the past year it really blew up and people couldnt stop talking about it and it sold millions of copies so of course a film version must be made look i read the book and it is just terribly written it was originally twilight fanfiction and it really shows the author of the novel didnt write the screenplay thankfully because while the script still is nowhere near great i wasnt cringing as hard as when i read the book and i will say that it is well made but for a movie about sex and love dakota johnson and jamie dornan have absolutely zero chemistry together and show no sign of being attracted to each other at all while fifty shades of grey the movie might be a little better endowed than its source material its still nothing worth recommending or sitting through
Jan 18 2015,positive,i was prepared to be bitterly disappointed with this film but left the cinema desperate for the next film very good
Jan 18 2015,positive,very true book some bits have been taken out but you cant expect it all  throughly enjoyed the film jamie and dakota pulled it off better than i expected looking forward to the next films 
Jan 17 2015,positive,forget those haters that know nothing about the book and judge the movie i loved it and both actors especially dakota johnson exceeded my expectations book fans like myself will love it i know i did  cant wait for the sequels laters baby
Jan 17 2015,negative,overhyped crap sex scenes should have been left as a book
Jan 17 2015,negative,ok  so i saw fifty shades of grey last night and i will admitnot impressed the movie had some funny awkward moments and the woman who played ana did a great job christian however was not done justice very disappointed in how they portray his character and the guy playing the part while i think he is a good actor in other things was not meant for this role also the sex scenes and moments leading up to them where tacky blunt and rushed without any type of charm definitely the feel of a cheap porno at times if u havent read the books u might enjoy it simply because u wont know all the details that were left out that made fifty shades what it is a sexy romantic rollercoaster of emotion
Jan 17 2015,neutral,this couldve been such a good film but in the end was a bit of a let down dakota johnson fits the character of ana steele perfectly but in the crucial break up scene at the end of the movie  fails to deliver the emotional intensity required jamie dornan as grey he may look hot in a suit but fails to convince the audience  that he fully grasps the emotional psychological and domineering facets of his very complex character this film was great opportunity that was sadly not exploited to its full potential a great shame reader if you want fully rounded characterisation please stick to the book  and let your own imaginations do the work
Jan 17 2015,positive,it was good i look forward to seeing whats next
Jan 17 2015,negative,worst ending of a moving
Jan 17 2015,negative,as i suspected  a load of tripe worst thing i have ever seen and ive seen some crap the money made from this movie should go to domestic abuse charities gross not even worth half a star
Jan 17 2015,positive,they missed the cringey bits from the book loved the actors and actress they picked good film
Jan 17 2015,positive,i really liked this movie i dont know why many people are giving 50 shades of grey a bad score probably because most of the people are men and they did not enjoy the movie because they were expecting more porn scenes lol cant wait for 50 shades darker im even going to go watch it again
Jan 16 2015,positive,beginning was really good but they rushed the end overall a pretty good job replicating the book i would see it again 
Jan 16 2015,positive,so sue me i found it watchable
Jan 16 2015,positive,i read all three books never went to see it over valentines weekend when it came out in the theater  bought the blue ray because i read the books some of my friends hated the film some like it considering it a as rated r so a lot of my imagination would like not like the film i found the film to be excellent my boyfriend never read the   even enjoyed the film the film follows the key parts of the book we learn about why christian is the way he is the shyness and virginity of anastasia and i like the way the film ended the first part better
Jan 16 2015,positive,truly amazing 
Jan 16 2015,positive,decent movie but not as good as it was hyped up to be
Jan 16 2015,positive,well done if you dont like nudity or sex dont go see it
Jan 16 2015,positive,i loved it if you read the series you understand that the actors were suppose to play parts the way they did whoever said there was no chemistry must not have watched the same movie i thought they were great together not who i would have chosen at first but i wound up loving them if you arent into that type of story you shouldnt watch the movie but for those of us who are it was perfect
Jan 16 2015,positive,this film is good which l was not expecting  is hot in all the right places
Jan 16 2015,neutral,i actually enjoyed it i think they did best they could artistically
Jan 16 2015,positive,the movie was way better than i thought it was going to be im definitely looking forward to seeing the next one or two you could hear a pin drop during the sex scenes
Jan 16 2015,positive,i really enjoyed watching this movie last night
Jan 15 2015,positive,not what i expected felt like it was mostly xrated would not recommend it to anyone
Jan 15 2015,neutral,get the girl a purse acting a little forced the story fails
Jan 15 2015,negative,bad acting unbelievably bad script and just plain unlikable characters the only reason i gave it 2 stars instead of a half is due to female nudity and laugh out loud moments due to terrible acting
Jan 15 2015,positive,the movie was awesome but has anyone noticed that it is very sommelier to the movie secretary from 2002 which was based off of a short story as well hmmmmmmmmmmmm they seem awfully familiar in plot story and the man is even called mr gray in both films
Jan 15 2015,negative,hmmm  what the books did was to capture a womans imagination with erotic and passionate imagery  it teased and enticed the senses and did to a woman what only a woman can know  the films interpretation of the books that in my opinion do have too much repetition was almost written for a man  it focused way too much on anastasia her nakedness and was at times uncomfortable to watch  there was no focusing on mr grey and his ripped jeans or how he made anastasia feel  instead it was focused on what a man could get out of a woman and actually turned the book into a negative feeling with me thinking was it actually about an abusive relationship rather than a love story  dakota actually was a very good anastasia but mr grey could have been cast better  his irish accent dropped through his poor attempt at american quite regularly throughout  despite me sat there thinking i should have waited for dvd the film started well and was funny and engaging as soon and the space filling sex scenes started it all felt a little cheep and i was actually embarrassed for dakota especially thinking of her having to sit though her own premiere i think for the sake of a book and its hype she sold herself out for a role that she should have turned down  having said that they should have left the book alone and in the imaginations of the woman who read it
Jan 15 2015,positive,the cast made this movie disappointing dakota johnson was the only cast member that fit somewhat adaptation to movie from the book was executed well enough though
Jan 14 2015,positive,if youre a fan of the books then you will enjoy the movie
Jan 14 2015,positive,it was a little cheesy like the first twilight movie hopefully it gets better with the next one
Jan 14 2015,positive,i read the book prior to seeing the movie and felt they did an amazing job at bringing it to life i feel people who havent read the book will have a different opinion of the movie as a whole i cant wait for the next two
Jan 14 2015,positive,i loved it and i cant wait for the next one
Jan 13 2015,positive,everything i expected although i expected mrgrey to have a more dominant essence
Jan 13 2015,positive,i wrote a great review but the blooming all lost it when i flicked to wikipedia and back here argh anyway to sum it up in one word  ok its basically a modern film of its day like basic instinct was and ricky horror in 20yrs there could be midnight showings and men dress in suits and women wear anyway no bad just wish hed have bought her a iphone poor girl having to use a 90s flip phone update  sequal due out next year here we go a valentines day yearly event like twilight rings and hobbit have become sigh actually this was way better than any of those film
Jan 13 2015,positive,loved it cant wait for the next
Jan 12 2015,positive,not many movies can be exactly like a book as this book was very long wed be there all night longlol but i believe it did a decent job and believe that the next film will be better
Jan 12 2015,neutral,okay but a pale reflection of the book and im not talking about the sex scenesthe scintillating give and take between the lovers has been watered down especially the cute emails and the two main actors are too bland as well
Jan 12 2015,positive,although not everything in the book could be captured on screen they did a fantastic job it left me wanting to see the next one right then
Jan 11 2015,negative,the actor for christian was unbelievable which ruined the tone of the whole movie
Jan 11 2015,negative,couldnt even get all the way through it
Jan 11 2015,negative,i was really disappointed was expecting my favorite book to be alive and it was crush horrible acting repeat scenes through the movie  i rather read the book 50 times then sit down and watch this movie again smh
Jan 11 2015,neutral,i really enjoyed the soundtrack i didnt enjoy much of anything else it just seems soplain and its a bondage movie i might see the second one but im not going out of my way
Jan 11 2015,neutral,i believe this was on the verge of porn i have read all three books several times and i believe this is depicted as close as possible to the book i do hope they continue with the series because of where it leaves off i have heard people say christian is a sick individual but they do not know about the content of the remaining books in most movies you cant know what is going on in the characters heads i think there should be a little more detail added to help understand the the characters journey the emotional growth
Jan 11 2015,positive,ive watched it and i liked it pfffffffft
Jan 11 2015,neutral,i hope they dont make a sequel because this movie was already bad enough
Jan 11 2015,positive,if you were worried about casting  dont enjoyed the actors   especially dakota johnsonthe  sex scenes were done well well  a few more from the book would have been nice i thought the movie should have kept more parts of the book inunless you read the books  then there was not enough character development with these missing parts especially with christian greys character overall done well  would look forward to the 2nd  3rd of the series
Jan 11 2015,negative,two stars cause he is sooooo hot hahahah
Jan 10 2015,positive,better than i expected but i think they picked the wrong actress to play annas role
Jan 10 2015,positive,hbo light porn cool movie
Jan 10 2015,positive,i was not expecting to like it as much as i did dakota johnson was perfect in this role very sweet and charming jamie was good as christian greyand great chemistry between the two of them followed the book fairly well just left out several parts due to time constraints im   glad i didnt let the negative press dissuade me from seeing it it was great fun
Jan 10 2015,positive,i enjoyed this movie and i cant wait for the next one
Jan 10 2015,positive,i feel the movie was to rush and skip a lot from the book
Jan 10 2015,positive,this movie was great to see but it was something i would have rather watched at home with my loved one cause it was like a soft porn movie but other then that if you have read the books it was right on with the book
Jan 9 2015,positive,i loved this movie  its a great love story of an innocent girl changing a guy who thinks he cant love
Jan 9 2015,negative,i was very disappointed i thought it was all horrible acting and extremely cheesy i wont
Jan 9 2015,positive,dissapointing like i suspected it might be
Jan 9 2015,neutral,jamie dornan and dakota johnson were amazing especially with what they had to work with please get a different screen writer and director they definitely missed the mark spent way to much time on anas character with little writing effort for christians character script was way to choppy seriously are there not any good screen writers out there maybe you should hire the screen writer that did the fall now thats someone who knows what there doing
Jan 8 2015,negative,not impressed did not do this book justice
Jan 8 2015,positive,i havent read any of the books and i dont want to the movie is perfect without the read a must see especially for those of us who havent read the books oh there will be more movies 
Jan 8 2015,positive,it was a great movie close to what was in the book i cant wait for the next one
Jan 8 2015,positive,good but not as intense as the books actress is way to skinny  can see her ribs yuck
Jan 8 2015,negative,a terrible and overrated film even worse than twilight  do not bother viewing this film or its print counterpart
Jan 7 2015,positive,doesnt do the books must justice but still hot
Jan 7 2015,positive,followed the book almost to a tee not as much sex as the book for sure but still a great story and movie
Jan 7 2015,positive,i dont hate it and i dont love it
Jan 7 2015,positive,acting is awful didnt live up to the massive expectations of the book
Jan 7 2015,negative,ive not read the books nor shall but having read a few positive reviews posted by friends i was curious to see if the movie was tolerable    it wasnt after an hour of having my intellect abused and sense of taste effed with pun intended id had enough cinematic assault and turned off the online freebie id have been pissed to pay for the film in fact theres no way that i would have paid to see this at all    one star but only because it was filmed in vancouver and gave local industry people jobs
Jan 7 2015,neutral,if you havent read the book its very hard to see the point of the movie since i have read the books and am a big fan i enjoyed it i didnt like who they chose to betray mr grey though i dont feel like you brought everything that mr grey was in the book to the movie it felt a little rushed but i guess you have to do that with books that are turned into movies i dont think they leave you with agood enough cliffhanger if you havent read the books to want to see the second but i definitely will see the sequels due to knowing whats to come from the book
Jan 7 2015,positive,it was a well cast film  i did enjoy it but as a lover of the books i was slightly disappointed at how much they missed out it wasnt as smooth running as id hoped either it jumped from scene to scene  lacked depth
Jan 6 2015,positive,this was a great show not as much sex  as people thought there was going to be
Jan 6 2015,positive,i loved the books so looking forward to seeing this 3
Jan 5 2015,positive,i dont know why this movie is getting poor reviews i suppose it has something to do with the social stigma associated with the bdsm community i am a supporter and occasional participant of the community that being said this movie could have been made differently what i mean by this is the movie could have been made with a serious tone instead it was made with a more humorous one i feel that was a brilliant choice on the directors part overall this movie was a great adaptation i just wish society would keep an open mind about this subject that doesnt mean i suggest they participate but be more accepting of course this is our society im talking about
Jan 5 2015,positive,loved it cant wait to see it again
Jan 5 2015,positive,omg i loved the movie
Jan 4 2015,positive,it was better than i thought
Jan 4 2015,positive,fifty shades of grey is a fair erotic romantic drama film it may not have a remarkable storytelling a wellwritten script or sharp direction the fan base readers of the novels may nitpick or love seeing the erotic story being adapted on the big screen it is different from being a typical romance story as the girl is introduced into the bdsm lifestyle and the guy who lives in a certain way it is going to have those clichés of the characters having that struggle as they both are changing themselves and have that urges that they cannot easily walk away from director sam taylorjohnson may have a certain feel on the movie basically an adult version of a fairy tale of an awkward virgin girl changing after her intimate moment with a billionaire businessman christian grey     the plot of the movie is directionless about a young college graduate anastasia steele dakota johnson who is offered the chance to interview a billionaire entrepreneur christian grey jamie dornan grey and anastasia begin a lifestyle of sadomasochistic relationship as she slowly changes and she tries to change him    the movie is going to have that corny dialogue of a script perhaps the novel is not even better knowing the author is trying to aim for that seductive chemistry and sexual fantasies the character like anastasia steele in the movie is so undeveloped that it makes her so dull even after she struggles with the change when her sexual fantasies are being explored fifty shades of grey is a fair film that does not have much effort into writing or an effective direction
Jan 4 2015,positive,so much better than the book       dakota johnson brought a whole new light to anastasia taking her from a boring and nowadays very typical bella swan like character to a seductive likable strong but yet weak just a fullon complicated and enjoyable character that made the cheesy lines throughout the film somewhat bearable       sn the cheesy lines are not due to the screenplay but the book in general is filled with lines that can make even the most hopeless romantic gag    what i appreciated the most was that it did not sugarcoat the emotional abuse that anastasia was indeed going through    nevertheless that very final elevator closing scene is one of the most awful things ive ever endured i understand it is supposed to end in a to be continued type of note but there should be some form of closure before the second part comes around next valentines day
Jan 4 2015,negative,this movie bordered on creepy and was as unromantic as you could get mrgrey is the opposite of what i was hoping for  he doesnt have any confidence in myself whatsoever and he oozes of jealousy and desperation in the scenes that are suppose to be hot you cant help but feel that these two are the most mismatched people to ever have sex save your moneygo watch spongebob instead at least that movie is meant to be a comedy
Jan 4 2015,positive,omgi loved this movie i hope theres more movies for the other books i absolutely loved this movie   
Jan 4 2015,positive,cant wait for part two good movie
Jan 4 2015,negative,not a well written book but i kept turning the pages same reaction in the movie theater kept thinking why am i here but stayed in my seat saw very little chemistry between dakota and jamie slick sets great clothes nice helicopter and car those were the high points wanted to find it better than the book couldnt two more to go oy
Jan 3 2015,positive,cant wait for the next one
Jan 3 2015,negative,i sincerely regret seeing this movie much dif seeing these types of scenes on screen than it is reading it in print parents please protect your children and teenagers from being exposed to this movie violent and in some cases disgusting this is not a movie about true love and healthy relationships but one of a vulgar sick fetish     sure part 2 is in the works will not be seeing it
Jan 3 2015,positive,good movie but the ending ugh very frustrating
Jan 3 2015,positive,loved it âºï havent read the books  cant wait for the 2nd
Jan 3 2015,negative,at some points the movie was better than the book but those moments were few  as bad as the book feels to read at times because of how its written its still better than the movie
Jan 3 2015,positive,cant wait for the sequel
Jan 3 2015,positive,saw it twice first time was so focused on what was in the book and not the movie that i didnt really focus on the movie as a whole went today and the second time was way better i kept an open mind and focused on the movie as the movie that it was and was so impressed with all the little details i didnt pick up on the first night it was greatly entertaining and my husband even enjoyed it ending felt a little rushed but got to the point i sure hope universal studios gives them a bigger budget for the next one cause this movie is gonna make them a lot of bank it just needs a few more extra rich or chic touches for it to be perfectly fifty shades
Jan 3 2015,negative,no chemistry between the main characters zero passion  very disappointed  gave it 2 stars because if i had not read the book i may have liked the movie
Jan 3 2015,positive,cant wait for the next one 
Jan 2 2015,positive,i loved this movie i loved it so much i am reading the next two books to get to the ending of it all
Jan 2 2015,positive,i was definitely skeptical about it but after seeing it i loved it most ppl giving this movie a bad review i feel didnt even read the book i think to watch this you have to read the book first
Jan 2 2015,positive,all the yes for this movie
Jan 2 2015,positive,i really enjoyed it and cant wait for the next
Jan 2 2015,positive,im not a expert on writing reviews for movies but this movie left me wanting more i read all three of the books and it did skip some parts from the book in the movie overall dakota johnson played her part to  a t i wasnt ooh la la over jamie so much i think they couldve found someone a bit better too play christian my opinion but this movie is worth watching
Jan 2 2015,negative,this was horrible no character development the scenes werent fully developed it felt like they took all the highlights from the book and made a movie
Jan 2 2015,negative,wow this movie was super awful and bad
Jan 1 2015,negative,not at all impressed for a film based off of an erotic fiction novel it lacked   most of the eroticism presented in the text genre romance romance and masochistic dont belong in the same sentence let alone a film the actors were painfully awkward to watch on screen excluding the few intimate scenes i will however admit that the soundtrack for this movie was rather impressive
Jan 1 2015,negative,fifty shades of grey is a well shot and semi well acted bore fest that relies on its twilight fan fiction inspired best selling novel of the same name not to mention its a bad example for relationships and is straight up uncomfortable to watch 
Jan 1 2015,negative,it wasnt a terrible movie but some of the depth that they tried so hard to put into it could have been better with the emotional scenesshe did great at looking emotional and the sex scenes gave me new ideas
Jan 1 2015,positive,the movie wasnt as good as the book but i will say they were consistent with how the book plays out just hated the ending i guess really nothing couldve compared to the books the other point for me has always been is that they chose the wrong actors to portray christian grey and anastasia steele
Jan 1 2015,negative,horribly written horribly acted horribly edited and the chemistry is not there within a film that absolutely needs to be focused on the chemistry of the main characters porn does it better and thats saying something
Jan 1 2015,negative,the actors were amazing but the plot of the movie was very choppy the ending was horrible the trailer is pretty much the movie i am a 50 shades super fan but the movie was very disappointing
Jan 1 2015,negative,she is an interesting actress but the story is too silly  the sex is silly and bad  the setting is too good to be believable
Jan 1 2015,neutral,the movie is not bad honestly good performance from both actors really liked the mr gray impersonification liked her less especially  the beginning but got better later  however if u have read the book thats wwhen u give a quite low score to this movie the book is def better the movie is more a love story overall i would say 25 stars waiting for the sequel lets see
Dec 31 2014,positive,loved it thought the movie was a good representation of the first book of the series cant wait until the next one comes out
Dec 31 2014,neutral,overall really disappointed rushed though everything not allowing any foundation of their relationship main characters didnt have chemistry they were trying too hard the sex scenes they did have were pretty good but needed more plus horrible ending
Dec 31 2014,positive,very hot interesting movie everyone should   go see this movie its hot and sexy
Dec 31 2014,positive,i gave it four stars because i didnt like the ending
Dec 31 2014,positive,it could have been better not horrible a little too faithful to the book making dialogue seem rigid and unnatural the two leads also didnt have much chemistry but it was a decent movie i cant wait and hopefully its better for fifty shades darker
Dec 30 2014,positive,part 2 cant wait
Dec 30 2014,negative,not nearly as good as the book
Dec 30 2014,positive,loved itcant wait for the next one
Dec 30 2014,neutral,could have been done so much better
Dec 29 2014,negative,what kind of an ending is that
Dec 29 2014,positive,dont listen to bull reviews it was awesome  dakota was amazing  funnier than the book too  go see it  hot
Dec 29 2014,negative,the only reason this gets half a star the glider was the best actor in the filmdo yourself a favor go buy the porno parody of 50 shades of grey much better acting in the porno i didnt think a movie could get worse than into the woods this one did what a waste of time and money
Dec 29 2014,positive,modern day 95 weeks if you can buy the young actors in such roles
Dec 28 2014,positive,love love love cant wait for the next one
Dec 28 2014,neutral,it wasnt what i truly thought it would be   but im hoping the next one will be better
Dec 28 2014,positive,oh boy i dont even know where to begin with this review for starters i loved the girl who played ana she felt real to me and had an amazing quirky personality that made her pretty even though i wouldnt consider her hollywood pretty i found myself liking her more and more as the story went on  on that note i have to say that the guy who played christian was awful i was hoping they would cast someone who was dripping with dominance from his very core where as this guy i described after about 5 minutes of the movie playing as a waif too scrawny too pretty and just not believable in this role this is a major let down   i found for about 40 of it that they did not have the  chemistry that was evident in the books the passion that made every girl want to go out and find their christian grey     i feel a lot of people are going to associate bdsm with the ways and reasons for doing it the way that christian does which is a very unfair interpretation because he does it from a place of abuse and pain when a dom should be opposite of that a dom should have his shit together and never spank and then leave or punish and not pleasure after at some point its a bit irritating that people who dont understand the pleasure and desire that can come from bdsm are going to now automatically associate it with abuse and basically consensual domestic violence    the parts of the movie where he really flashed his money like the airplane scene and buying her extravagant gifts was a bit cheesy and annoying like it took away from the story because it felt like she wasnt that kind of girl and he was trying to impress her which wasnt really working on her or me     a few key things that i loved about the movie would be how they showed the sex scenes it showed a lot more then i thought they would and i like how they showed different positions and like how he was entering her without actually seeing it i thought it was quite creative how they chose to do that   secondly i love how they did the red room of pain it was like every bdsm lovers dream dungeon       i hated how it ended but i know its because its how it ended the first book    i look forward to watching the next two but i really hope the guy playing christian gets a lot better
Dec 28 2014,positive,i loved it  not as good as the book but movies based off of books are never better 3
Dec 27 2014,positive,i thought it was very good romantic passionate and funny i liked the balance of him liking control but realizing she was in control
Dec 27 2014,positive,absolutely amazing made me remember all the feelings of falling in love the first time again sex scenes were dripping wet theater was so hot
Dec 27 2014,positive,many big differences from novel  film ending had the whole theater highly confused but kept my freaky ass entertained
Dec 27 2014,positive,well this did surprise me considering everyone has their own version of the story in their head this was adapted quite well    jamie dornan had an awful american accent though shame all three books were not adapted at once as the ending was a little jarring
Dec 27 2014,negative,characters did not match those in the book series very disappointed
Dec 27 2014,positive,i am a fan of the books and think it mirrored the trilogy as best it can with an r rating in two hours  im not sure if it was made with the fans in mind since it is missing some of the books popular repeated phrases and magic moments though if you havent read the books you may question what is going on and hate the ending
Dec 27 2014,positive,i was looking for a love story and thats what i got loved it
Dec 27 2014,neutral,if you havent read the books the movies okay but if you have its a bit disappointing
Dec 26 2014,positive,they could have hired better actresses movie was not bad but okay
Dec 26 2014,positive,very nicely done great story and film
Dec 26 2014,negative,this is one of the worst pieces of shit i have ever seen in my life and it is just made for a cash grab this movie seems like a porno that was written by a teenage girl on her period who has watch way to much abc family the acting is absolutely terrible and is very very hard to watch i hate every thing about this film and it has absolutely zero redeeming qualities this films only audience is curious teenagers and old ladies who havent had sex in 10 years which both audiences could just stay home and watch real porn which probably is better written and probably has a lot better acting overall i completely hated this ass of a film and no one should ever suffer through this shitty shitty film
Dec 26 2014,positive,not totally awful and much better than the book
Dec 25 2014,neutral,not as good as i thought it would be
Dec 24 2014,positive,good but mad it was only the first book like really
Dec 23 2014,positive,not the book but not bad
Dec 22 2014,positive,loved itat some parts i get that its a movie it has to have sad and happy parts and obviously i liked the happy parts and didnt care too much for the sad parts but all in all was a great movie and it needs a second one
Dec 22 2014,positive,ok i read the books twice so i know what to expect  i couldnt connect with the guy playing mrgrey not hot enoughwith that being said i still will watch the other ones coming out but if u havent read the books and u watched this movie i think u will be lost 
Dec 22 2014,positive,very intimidating 
Dec 22 2014,negative,so shocked by this movie i had to review worse then the book itself so shockingly crap and i cant believe the ending what was that what did we actually see in the whole movie what did i understand nothing because we just see a few whips here and there and a few smacks to her bottom wowie no actual sex happening on the screen and then in the end she just walks away wow
Dec 21 2014,negative,sadly whilst at times fifty shades is showgirls bad mostly its just really dull  the leads have no charisma and its pace plodding but mostly it serves as a lesson to writers and filmmakers everywhere no matter how sht your work is someone somewhere will probably still watch it
Dec 21 2014,positive,great movie a little watered down from the book but i guess thats probably a good thing lol
Dec 21 2014,positive,subtle and stirring and whilst jamie dornans irish accent seeps in on occasion it was well acted and beautifully shot definitely wanting both leads for parts 2 and 3
Dec 21 2014,positive,definitely would love to see this with my fiancã
Dec 20 2014,negative,there is nothing sexy about this movie
Dec 20 2014,negative,if youve read the book skip this movie if you havent read the book consider skipping this movie as it movies really slowly
Dec 20 2014,negative,the wannabe valentines r rated wannabe x rated based on the bestseller 50 shades of grey that supposedly has a bunch of fans out there somewhere defintely was a little meh in my opinion with the possible exception of bringing a second generation actress to the fore in dakota johnson melanie and don johnsons young whipper snapper whose supposedly been kicking around for a bit until this project came along pretty much seems to exist just on a very basic level with dakota being the soon to be graduating somewhat naive english lit student who falls in with an extremely accomplished business man while conducting an interview for her roommate for the school paper once the relationship starts and you gradually start pealing back the layers into the kick and  the playroom and such you never really buy why dakota sticks around for as long as she does outside of the gradual building for her confidence in being able to be the one in control and being able to say no or for that matter why mr grey is the way he is outside of him being a former submissive trying to be in control himself it just seemed outside of a surprisingly good soundtrack and production value the material and character depth is amazingly underdeveloped not that i was expecting much  and is just there for sensationalism and should have possibly stayed on late night on showcase and the ending was a bit ubrupt hopefully it stayed strictly as a one night stand
Dec 20 2014,positive,was better than i thought it was going to be however the whole film seemed to be very rushed and it didnt seem to follow the book very well at all annas acting didnt go with the actual character in the book and didnt follow her characteristics well at all
Dec 19 2014,positive,i only give it a 4 because of jaime dornan  disappointed i really didnt care that much for the sex scenes it was more about how they felt in love i feel like they focus way to much on those scenes then christian and anastacia 
Dec 19 2014,positive,the movie followed the book well im glad i read the books because the end will leave you begging for more interesting love story
Dec 19 2014,negative,this is just a really bad portrayal of the book it makes him seem like more of a victim than it should
Dec 19 2014,positive,absolutely fell in love with this movie i cant wait for the sequels
Dec 19 2014,negative,this was sooo boring cant believe its worse than twilight
Dec 19 2014,negative,fk this movieor whatever this thing is that calls itself a movie
Dec 19 2014,positive,i loved the whole movie but the ending sucked the way she left and it was suddenly over was horrible everything else i loved
Dec 18 2014,positive,im surely in the minority that enjoyed the movie sure there were things that couldve been better but i would watch it again i enjoyed all three books in the trilogy as well so thats probably why i enjoyed it as much as i did
Dec 18 2014,positive,i havent read the books so i cant say if it follows it or not  but the movie itself was interesting yet tamed based in all the hype
Dec 17 2014,positive,follows the book fairly well if you liked the book you will not be disappointed both actors do their parts and are likable and engaging
Dec 17 2014,negative,it was okay i think they could have gone with different actors the movie could have been longer too with more dialogue they dont emphasize him saying laterz babe and they forgot to mention then metal balls at dinner and he didnt seem as obsessed with her in the movie as he was in the books
Dec 17 2014,positive,almost as good as the books im in love with the story of ana and christian
Dec 16 2014,negative,terrible film you will be very disappointed the acting was awful  very wooden performances 
Dec 16 2014,negative,if you want to get into emotional and physical abuse go watch this if you want to get into bdsm go watch something else
Dec 16 2014,neutral,quite enjoyed the film having never read the books
Dec 16 2014,negative,fifty shades of dull sex and wooden acting  movie review fifty shades of grey  date viewed february 18 2015  directed by sam taylorjohnson nowhere boy  screenplay by kelly marcel based on the novel by el james  starring dakota johnson jamie dornan jennifer ehle eloise mumford luke grimes  victor rasuk callum keith rennie rita ora  max martini andrew airlie dylan neal and marcia gay harden    mr grey wont see you right now he needs to find an acting coach and a better script than this dull and lifeless adaptation of fifty shades of grey how can you have erotic sex in a movie and make it boring who knew that christian grey was as grey and stonefaced as dolph lundgren you can tell from his eyeexpressions that jamie dornan was uncomfortable in the role fifty shades of grey is like the 1986 movie 9 12 weeks but with bigger buzz dull sex and wooden acting    dakota johnson the daughter of actors don johnson and melanie griffith stars as anastasia steele the 21yearold literature student from washington state university who gets the big interview with wealthy entrepreneur christian grey dornan anas roommate kate kavanagh eloise mumford was originally going to interview mr grey but she became ill so ana took her place christian is interested in her so he follows her to the hardware store where she works soon they begin a relationship that will be dull and boring and they will have hot passionate sex yes ladies and gentlemen even the sex scenes are boring     after all the bondage and sex games it turns out that christians rules are do not engage in love with him or even touch him in bed if you break one of christians rules you will be punished christian grey has the brain capacity of a silver spoon this guy doesnt care about love at all christians rules soon begin to take a toll on ana who spoiler alert leaves him and his amazing lifestyle at the end director sam taylorjohnson who is the wife of kickass actor aaron taylorjohnson is capable of making this movie fifty shades of grey has a nice setting and she has a good actress in dakota johnson but her character is badly written    i wouldve cared about this movie if it had smart writing and characters we like to know and care about but fifty shades of grey based on el james worldwide bestseller is not that movie the cast also includes jennifer ehle zero dark thirty as anas mother max martini captain phillips as christians limo driver luke grimes american sniper as christians adopted brother and oscar winner marcia gay harden as christians mother charlie hunnam was originally the first choice to play christian grey but he dropped out of the film to do the last seasons of sons of anarchy so now were stuck with this fashion model    im sure universal plans on doing the two sequels to fifty shades so get ready for more endless love and bondage because we have another hollywood franchise to deal with
Dec 15 2014,positive,this film was scripted from a poorly written erotica novel that was established on a very linear perspective of love sexuality and gender roles with this being said i entered the film with no other expectations than to view the traditional romantic film with a twist of bondage and characters that dwell on the surface with stereotypical outlines  for what fifty shades of grey was intended to be it hits the nail on the head offering a meek yet charming dakota johnson and a mysterious jaime dornan and the result is a sensual and shallow perspective that doesnt disappoint and actually mildly entertains  enter this film with no expectations and be pleasantly surprised by the watchable story that unfolds
Dec 15 2014,positive,i must say i was very skeptical about the  actors playing christian and ana after reading the books then seeing the movie it worked they really made them come to life on screen i wanted a nc17 rating but ya dont get everything
Dec 15 2014,positive,in line waiting to see the 2 next ones dakota johnson did a very good performance and so did jamie dornan
Dec 15 2014,positive,was ok as usual not worth the hype but just a modern love story with a tweak dont need to be on big screen â
Dec 14 2014,positive,it was better than expected although some of the playfulness from the book didnt shine through thats what made it more believable that she could flip him over to her side of things you could tell in the book he was stepping outside his comfort zone not so much in the movie i hope they both loosen up in the next film
Dec 14 2014,positive,exceeded expectations  those who havent read the books 3 may be disappointed in the ending but thats how book one ended  and 2 more movies are on the way
Dec 14 2014,positive,the book was much better the beginning was god awful but as the movie went on the acting was a little better
Dec 14 2014,positive,nowhere near as terrible as i thought it was gonna be
Dec 14 2014,negative,50 shades of sht the book is 100x better than failed at the film
Dec 14 2014,positive,just got bk from watching 50 shades of grey was ok for a girly film and as close to a porn as legally possible  doesnt leave much to the imagination dakota johnson plays the part well jamie dornan plays mr grey well and nearly to a t but he is lacking that edge so still say the part of mr grey should have gone to jonathan rhys meyers  watch the trailers for dracula u will no wot i mean
Dec 14 2014,positive,love does exactly what it says on the tin
Dec 13 2014,negative,the best part was the audience the 30 or so 40 housewives wearing mens white dress shirts with a grey tie made for quite the peanut gallery i did feel bad for the two men who were dragged with their significant others   johnson attempting to be naive or simple and a virgin absolutely didnt work dornan did well he looked to enjoy his role  there was no story development and to be honest i didnt expect any   the best scenes included max martini and callum keith rennie they are always fun to watch   overall it felt like a mess but the peanut gallery enjoyed it
Dec 13 2014,positive,it was ok he definitely is not what i pictured for christian i didnt think it was as awful as everyone was saying but the books are hands down better
Dec 13 2014,positive,i loved the books and i loved the movie
Dec 13 2014,positive,im a fanatic of this story since it was in the book but now it was in the movie its so intense to watch every episode by the way if anyone is interested in the adult toys they used then heres your chance to have it now but dont forget to use the coupon code shades10 at the checkout to get 2 of the following manual gifts if you spend 17 or more plus romance kit  plus professional ladies 6pack for more info just visit this link 
Dec 12 2014,negative,so ridiculously bad fell asleep multiple times and even the bdsm scenes werent enough to keep me interested how did this junk of a movie even get made let alone make half a billion dollars yes with a b worldwide during opening weekend do yourself a favor and skip this one til is showing on skinimax
Dec 12 2014,negative,pretty boring  predictable didnt even finish watching the whole thing

Dec 9 2014,positive,better than the book
Dec 9 2014,positive,loved it cant wait to see the next one xxx
Dec 9 2014,positive,the scenes were very carefully chosen to tell the story in a tasteful way the actors do a great job transmitting their feelings with gestures the movie is very intense because everything happens extremely fast the movie lacks a little bit in the script department but if you read the three books and liked them you will get it all perfectly i would say do not pay attention to the critics and go see it for yourself the actors do a great job christian grey is very mysterious and reserved jamie dornan completely fulfills the role dakota johnson is the perfect anastasia she is ingenuous but sassy and even funnier than the ana in the books
Dec 9 2014,positive,interesting wild superseductive
Dec 8 2014,positive,more understandable if you read the book
Dec 8 2014,positive,this had been a movie i was dead set against watching but as a filmmaker i firmly believe you cannot critically analyse a piece if youve not experienced it cue my viewing of the twilight saga   i got 30 pages into the book upon its release and has to stop its a dire read like a teenager given microsoft word for the first time and describing what that think sex really is  first things first the soundtrack is awesome sia ellie goulding and the weeknd make it brilliant  the film itself is not the most terrible thing ive seen sure the dominant role is all wrong and the it feels like it needs the nudity to survive but i have genuinely seen worse i have an understanding what bdsm and domsub roles entail and im not under any illusion it should look like this  highlight is certainly the quirky comments from anastasia
Dec 8 2014,negative,waste of my life bth
Dec 8 2014,positive,taking its source material and improving on it tenfold fifty shades of grey provides the audience with a captivating love story that is much classier and more enjoyable than its print counterpart
Dec 7 2014,negative,the movie was straight garbagethe hype was for nothing the books are better
Dec 7 2014,positive,they did a really good job with this film i loved it
Dec 7 2014,positive,hardly a edge of the seat movie but it is watchable and well acted good cast
Dec 7 2014,positive,i dont care what anyone says this was the best and sexiest romantic film in years its delicious and completely drop dead hot i give the actors much kudos on all the rough passionate on screen chemistry i cannot wait for the rest of the series and the ending i thought it was the perfect cliffhanger dakota and jamie we love you ps im no giving it a full 5 stars because jamie didnt show his goods only a very quick tease not cool lol
Dec 7 2014,positive,loved this totally followed the book i was so happy yum
Dec 7 2014,neutral,i heavily rejected the lead female character and was left furious at the storyline having said that the actors were amazing to have such an effect
Dec 7 2014,positive,i liked it but the books are better
Dec 6 2014,positive,nothing is ever as good as the books but i liked this movie
Dec 6 2014,positive,the media has sensationalized the sex in this movie if you go in expecting bdsm porn you wont see it i for one enjoyed it i didnt expect a lot so my lowered expectations led to being pleasantly surprised if you wanna watch porn then watch porn you wanna see a decent love story with a hint of kink check this out also i didnt read the book
Dec 6 2014,neutral,poorly acted poor story line
Dec 6 2014,positive,mr grey hmmmmmstraightforward and he knowswant he wantshe do a safe sex with the condomsi like that type of mannot like guys those days they dont know whatexactly they want plus they play a silly games the movie its actually quite funnyvery interesting red room with the unusual equipment well the end of the moviewasnt very peachy

Dec 5 2014,positive,i actually enjoyed this more than the book
Dec 5 2014,negative,im gonna say something i rarely say this was way better than the book maybe because none of the authors awful writing was in existence
Dec 5 2014,neutral,um yeah soi didnt read the book so i cant judge the story in its entirety but i was curious enough to see the movie  its actually more depressing than anything  i love that ana remains a strong individual through out and only submits when she chooses to  but the christian character is so disturbed and there is no resolution for him
Dec 4 2014,positive,i really liked the movie minus the talking and giggling women its wasnt as bad as some people are saying and i would love to see the next movie and hope both actors do it
Dec 4 2014,positive,i have to say i loved this movie and cant wait to see the next i felt it was a fantastic start to the movies yes it wasnt as kinky as the book but i feel it would of been like a porno if it had it did have a few flaws but a brill way to kick it off

Dec 3 2014,neutral,not impressed at all terrible castingbad acting and non flowing plot
Dec 3 2014,neutral,the laughs from the audience were so distracting during the movie and the most funny part was when the movie ended so many people said  sh
Dec 3 2014,negative,they turned the book into a comedy which was a downer
Dec 3 2014,positive,cant wait for part 2âtm
Dec 2 2014,positive,a really really good movie for those who are into this kind of movie
Dec 1 2014,negative,save your money first time i have fallen asleep at a movie in years
Dec 1 2014,negative,this is proof of why marketing and advertising is the last department or expense you shut down no matter how bad things are marketing fixes it even if the product is extremely bad cheers for the marketing guys
Dec 1 2014,positive,the closet movie based off a book that ive ever seen  critics gave this bad reviews but theyre definitely wrong about it  if you havent read the book and plan on seeing this i really recommend reading the book before or after you do  it has a true love story to it
Dec 1 2014,negative,i wish we was told us about doing it in three parts also i wish they read the book because elliott is suppose to be as hot as christian grey i wish they cast better then they did
Nov 30 2014,positive,it was a great movie they did an awsomd job to try to keep it lime the book hoping they dont stop here i want to se the fifty shades of darkness in theathers soon
Nov 30 2014,positive,this movie deserves more than what was rated by the criticsit gave more than enough scenes and content from the book to not make it a porn movieat first i didnt like the actors playingi was like they dont fill up the christian and ana i have imaginedbut i was wrongchristian was so hot and you could feel that even at firstthere was already sexual tension between themmaybe for viewers who havent read the bookthey might be confused about the content of the movie at firstlike my sister wasbut anywayi cant wait for the sequel âï

Nov 30 2014,negative,this is garbage no plot no pithy or engaging dialog just garbage
Nov 30 2014,negative,lacks a lot of story not much chemistry between the two actors horrific acting skills almost felt like the movie was portrayed on sarcasm everything felt way too rushed annestasia doesnt even make him work for it she doesnt hold her ground and is easily controlled through persuasion unfortunately she became just another play toy to him i was waiting for a chase but there is no hint of that she is suppose to represent how shy and coy she is yet she demonstrates otherwise she truly did become the submissive one its obvious christian has some serious issues to work on however anna follows right after him the entire movie came across as humorous more than a true passionate romance
Nov 29 2014,negative,didnt do the book any justice in my opinion loved the books but the movie was boring and the actors you could tell just werent into the roles at all
Nov 29 2014,negative,please dont make the sequel

Nov 27 2014,negative,i thing the quote from the movie sums this one up fifty shades of fucked up
Nov 27 2014,positive,i read the book and was slightly displeased with the amount of things left out of the movie that were in the book but its understandable  overall it was pretty good but the ending i wish they went slightly more in depth for those who didnt read the book but as long as the trilogy is completed i think the ending will make sense
Nov 27 2014,negative,dont do it do not go see this terrible terrible movie it is extremely degrading and disturbing the entire cast and production should be ashamed of themselves for making this and being apart of this save your money people and go see something elseanything else

Nov 16 2014,positive,good points about this film it stuck to the book which is great for us who have read it dakota was great as ana played the character really well music score is fantastic sex scenes played out as best they possibly could be without it being porn bad points jumped about too much for me i know the book is long and its hard to cram it into a 2 hour film but felt some scenes could have been a little longer chemistry between the actors left a lot to be desired jamie d looked awkward in some scenes all in all if you want a good girlie night out go see it with your friends

Nov 3 2014,positive,amazing  it is best if you read the books first so that you know all the little details that they couldnt but in movie have an open mind and dont be judgmental theres always a story behind why someone is the way they are or why people are into what there into they picked the perfect actor and actress cant wait for fifty shades darker
Nov 1 2014,positive,the sex scenes were worth it alone people say you could just go watch porn but porn is not sexy the way they pulled it off in this movie also dakota johnsons acting was good most everything else is pretty ridiculous just let yourself get sucked in to the fantasy
Oct 25 2014,positive,weird movie andwow
Oct 18 2014,positive,my partner  i saw it for valentines day  we both enjoyed it a lot cant wait for the next one to come out very satisfied keep up the good work xx
Oct 18 2014,negative,as good as i expected terrible acting and nothing even close to the book i understand its not possible but even some well known actors would have made it better
Oct 15 2014,positive,he was no christian grey
Oct 14 2014,positive,i liked christian intense stare lost boy look amazing wellcut and tailored suits anastasia was just like i imagined her but the movie was not good  sad
Oct 14 2014,positive,it was very much like the bookbut it felt a little fast
Oct 11 2014,negative,so disappointed loved the books hoped for more the chemistry between ana and christian is great but they left out too much about the story and the sex scenes were much better in the book they should have stayed true and rated it nc 17
Oct 8 2014,positive,i mean lets be honest you have to know what youre signing up for with this movie and it delivered that it was hot and great to look at and followed the books well is it the next award winning film no but its great for the kind of entertainment it is and i think the actors turned out representing and flattered the characters well my main point is bravo jamie job well done 
Oct 5 2014,positive,great adaptation of the book cant  wait for the other two
Oct 4 2014,negative,the books were way better than the movie as always though it was boring the first half then it was just sex i believe the next movie will pick up better
Oct 3 2014,positive,this film was as expected fun flirty and not to be taken too seriously id rate it 325
Sep 30 2014,positive,jamie dornan as christian grey a dream come true
Sep 29 2014,positive,i read the book and the movie was a mere appetizer to what contents were in the books the books were detailed precise and graphic the movie was rrated but not rx rated if you wanted the full christian grey treatment lol dont get me wrong the film was steamy graphic and damn delicious me personally i do not see how men can get turned on treating a women like things and the women getting any sort ofâ fulfillmentâ or satisfaction being treated like an inaptâ object i had the opportunity to see the movie on thursday night in imax before its opening debut the theater was not that crowded but i loved the imagery in the movie for instance in certain scenes where body parts and lips and erotic things were zoomed in to show the audience how intense the sm and the passion forâ dominanceâ was i felt that was aâ great touch it made me really get into the movie and get in christians head to fully understand why he chose to be the man he was the character of ana was played beautifully and she was acting like any normal woman would act if they were in love with a man who feeds on pain and dominating a woman i could understand why she would want to change him but some people are open to change while others arent the way the film ended i did not approve of but it matched the beginning of the film which is probably why it ended the way that it did and it left me wanting more just like ana wanted more more of christian the softer side compassionate side caring any woman would want what ana did a man to sleep next to a man to hold her kiss her tell her he loves her not a man to tell her assume the position and dont make me ask you twice who wants that in any relationship â i enjoyed the movie because i enjoyed the books and i know what is in store had i not read the book i still would have said that this was a great movie because it is something that is alive fresh new and can be seen by millions and leave a lasting impression on people of all ages and all mind sets it could have the ability to make men realize they can change if they are dominant towards women it can show women that they can change a man if he is worth fighting for it can show men that women can find something better if the men do not step it up and show them they are precious and should be treated as such etc the movie did not have raunchy  graphic scenes but the sex scenes are intense but not extreme i enjoyed the film but did not enjoy seeing what the character of christian grey enjoyed
Sep 25 2014,negative,the chemistry just wasnt there between the two and he did not capture the character of christian grey disappointed
Sep 20 2014,negative,i really think it has a chance to improve  i will issue an overall rating once the entire series is complete
Sep 19 2014,positive,felt too rushed want a second one but they need to take the time to make it
Sep 15 2014,negative,decent so bad its good material
Sep 14 2014,negative,really bad i didnt have very high hopes but even those little hopes i had were letdown the only reason i gave it one and a half stars is because i thought dakota johnson was a much better ana than in the book she had some funny scenes so they at least got me through the movie
Sep 12 2014,negative,so i got to watch this piece of freaken garbage my god jesus christ where do i start    the bad    this is basically twilight 20    bella 20 she is just a bad actress from the lip biting and bad writing to being a weak character who always needs a man because she cant be happy without a man i hate woman characters like that you dont see riply sarah connor black widow or gamora needing man    edward 20 this man should not talk he is just a bad actor to the core he only got the part cause good actor charlie hunam said no because he didnt want to ruin his career thank god he said no    jacob 20 looks gay like talor laughtner wants to have sex with bella 20 like twilight gets stuck in friend zone like twilight    i feel bad for all these actors who basically have this to look back on that basically will win them razzies in 2016    the music is awful    the sex scenes are not enjoyable     same location as twilight    nmphyomaniac makes this look like a disney movie cause this is the biggest soft core porn ive ever seen    the sad thing twilight is better than this at least those movies have robert patterson and kristen stewert     i hope to god these sequels bomb even next years valentines deadpool is the valentine movie to watch    the good  that the movie ended    so far this is the worst movie of the year possible will be the worst movie of the year and im gonna go a far and say worst movie ever yes even worse than batman  robin    grade f freaken minus    lol rant done
Sep 6 2014,positive,i wish it was closer to the book hoping sequel is closer to e l james adaption
Sep 1 2014,positive,hate the way it ended though it shouldve ended differently where anna ana christian got back together and he was more open to her finally how in the world it gon end with her getting in the elevator same way they met movie ending was a tease hope it picks up where it left off in part 2 but overall excellent movie 5 stars
Aug 28 2014,positive,its such a great movie they followed most of the book if you are a fan youll love it
Aug 26 2014,negative,my favorite film is 1941s citizen kane
Aug 24 2014,neutral,as expected the book is better than the movie
Aug 21 2014,positive,people the movie is excellent but to people that can identify themselves with it not much the kinky part of it but the challenge of break barries to fall in love when you feel you cannot
Aug 19 2014,positive,here i am sitting within an entire cinema full of what i assume is horny book worm women and i mean full there was like maybe two other poor guys that looked like they had been dragged along to this opening screening and i suddenly felt like i was that kid who was about to be turned into a mouse in that movie the witches because im an intruder     so while these women fight over better seats because theyre not sitting in their allocated seats the arguments that prevailed was the highlight of my night with groups of 50 year old women refusing to move seats so they could get a better view of their knight and shining armour they all fantasied over all these years security was called popcorn was cold and even mr grey took his bloody helicopter and said theyre all fifty shades of f up    put aside my traumatising event of attending this premier because of those being psychotically frustrated around me the film started 30 minutes late because of these selfish seat issues i found my self enjoying the awkward funny element of the story more than i liked the book with only reading half of the book i only seen half of this coming     for those who dont know 50 shades is originally a popular book trilogy that traces a relationship between a college graduate and business man it is notable for its explicitly erotic scenes featuring elements of sexual practices involving bondagediscipline dominancesubmission and sadismmasochism bdsm if you didnt catch that there you go    anyway the film entertained me and of course my girlfriend who would be the only reason i sit in fear inside my home away from home watching a movie like this at the cinema on a full moon full of hungry vampires lol no its a great film to get out with your girlfriend boyfriend or your right hand or that creepy person sitting next to you just take this as a warning that the cinema for this flick may or may not turn into wwe wrestlemania 50    i can see this being a cult classic with team grey tshirts and maybe some vampires or shiny diamonds of some sort in the next movie just sayin more dragons would be cool too however i really enjoyed this film and loved the ending because i was able to get to my helicopter and fly very far away haha nah it was a great ending and i will look forward to the next film just not the premier i may even read the bloody book because im bloody interested now aint i     overall thats all later baby    ps dear local cinema if you ever hold the sequel premier were going to need a bigger boat
Aug 17 2014,negative,the acting and the screen adaption were both horrible i was very disappointed after waiting so long for the movie to come out
Aug 17 2014,positive,best movie ever definitely recommend it do yourselves a favor and go watch it
Aug 17 2014,positive,not too shabby teaches about opening up and trusting again
Aug 11 2014,positive,it was ok although it had many scenes cut out and the sex wasnt as fulfilling it wasnt terrible i do wish they could have included more details from the book the movie was fast paced and probably difficult to understand for those who have not read the book i hope the next film is better
Aug 10 2014,neutral,great story maybe but i think they didnt worked hard enough to make this movie a success i expected hbo sex scenes with reallife sex movements and sounds they think that showing tits and butts is what people expected but it didnt looked realistic  another think that didnt let the movie be perfect is that there was no chemistry between jamie dornan and dakota so in the romantic scenes i was not excited at all it is entertaining and sexy but not enough
Aug 5 2014,positive,i really liked fifty shades of grey i didnt think i would enjoy the characters like i did some of anastasias reactions werent really believable to me also the last sex scenes music wasnt really appropriate i was surprised by how much skin they showed because i thought they were going to tone it down too much they definitely toned down the bdsm aspects which was fine i feel like that opened it to a larger audience they included the scenes that they needed to i may find that when i finish rereading the book i may find other things that i would have wanted to see but its hard to fit everything into 2 hours overall it was pretty good there were funny moments that werent present in the book the acting was pretty good considering neither of the actors were probably into this i thought they pulled off the chemistry
Jul 31 2014,positive,not as good as the book left us  on a big cliff hanger it was slow to start and in my eyes they portraied ana as a child
Jul 30 2014,positive,ok so i had to sleep on this review before i wrote it initially i walked away not feeling one way or the other the sex scenes were a little bit of a let down almost like new teenager sex scenes the chemistry between these two were lacking at the most crucial of times dakota did a great job but seemed way more timid than who the real anna shouldve been she needed her hurt to really fly at the last scene in the red room and it didnt come across powerful enough dorian as grey now here is where it is tricky he wasnt my first or second or tenth choice for this role but there were times when he delivered some  i think the film was good and everyone has to see it to make there own judgement call on this i am hoping this would be like twilight where each movie got increasing my better with time i didnt expect a play by play of the book but too much was left out and it seemed really choppy and hard to follow especially if you never read the book  with the next movie they have to bring it
Jul 28 2014,negative,even if it didnt have all the hype it would still just be a drab movie but the hype definitely made it worse not as bad as i expected though
Jul 28 2014,positive,he was good she was good and it was surprisingly funny the build up to the first kiss wasnt as intense as i would have liked and the first half felt like it was lacking something but the second half really had me it could have been better but it doesnt deserve all the hate  i enjoyed it
Jul 28 2014,positive,not bad actually a little funny in parts dakota johnson played her part well jamie dornan was alright he was trying really hard to cover his sexy accent sex scenes were meh too much dakota not enough jamie
Jul 28 2014,positive,better than i expected it to be  love the casting especially dakota johnson as anna steele bring on part 2
Jul 27 2014,positive,couldnt expect much because book one introduces the rest of the story the movie followed along with the book nicely if there is a sequel which they should considering the major cliffhanger part 2 and 3 has sooo much to offer to make the movie series better
Jul 26 2014,positive,stays true enough to the book and i get that it should feel somewhat cold and distant but felt to cold okay but not impressed
Jul 25 2014,positive,loved the book loved the movie enough said
Jul 25 2014,positive,i went in with an open mind but it wasnt what i hoped key elements of the book that should have been in there werent and parts that were didnt excatly come out right it wasnt bad but it wasnt great either
Jul 24 2014,neutral,movie sucked plot was useless everything just sucked except for seeing dakota johnsons ass tits and nipples end of story
Jul 24 2014,neutral,just okaythe movie lacked the intensity the book incited
Jul 24 2014,negative,really this movie was rushed left out so much information so disappointed and he needs to get a new lock for that door rich people dont have sticky locks  34
Jul 24 2014,negative,horrible horrible movie what an embarrassment to the book id give it no stars if i could you cant take a book like that and make a movie plain and simple not to mention the acting was horrible what a disgrace
Jul 24 2014,negative,the 15 stars are because dakota johnson is really cute and would be perfect for romcoms but other than that this film sucked the dialogue and script were terrible and awkward and its abuse i mean what more do you need its abuse passed off as bdsm she falls in love wayyy too fast and he is way too creepy and controlling the ending was great because she left him the sequels apparently see her coming back to him and having a baby with him ugh just end it like this
Jul 24 2014,positive,this film adaptation distills the original material with surgical precision it liberates itself from the books horrific dialogue tampons inner monologue and objectification speaking of objectification dakota johnson is absolutely stunning she is anastasia steele shes strong she chooses when to be vulnerable shes her own character and she can certainly take a hit this flick had my inner goddess rejoicing
Jul 24 2014,negative,could we give 5 points  i liked the book the movie is terrible  terrible acting and no chemistry really bad movie
Jul 24 2014,positive,so much was missing but i give them 5 stars for trying to fulfill that crazy book to a movie haha
Jul 24 2014,neutral,surges of lustful desires
Jul 24 2014,positive,pretty good the ending definitely leaves you wanting more
Jul 24 2014,positive,omg absolutely loved it actors where fantastic and scenes were well put together few funny parts and obviously the pleasureable scenes the storeline kept you interested the whole way through the film looking forward to next one in 2016
Jul 24 2014,positive,just has gripping as the book
Jul 24 2014,positive,the movie went along with the book beside christian expressed more of his feeling towards ana 
Jul 24 2014,neutral,faithful to the book  nicely paced
Jul 24 2014,positive,i dont think they couldve picked a better christian grey jamieyum love the added bite out of the toast scene i wouldve lunged at him in that moment tho
Jul 23 2014,negative,i was very disappointed in this movie a lot of information was left out if i had not read the book i would have been totally lost  so disappointed ã
Jul 23 2014,positive,red room since was great but there went the book to much  hope fifty shades of darker is more like the book
Jul 23 2014,positive,love it cant wait for the next one
Jul 23 2014,positive,the movie coincides with book  i think dornan did a great job of portraying christian gray mood yet seductive character  i think a lot of people disliked the ending but come on we all know there are 3 books
Jul 22 2014,positive,really brought the book to life
Jul 22 2014,positive,ehhhh the book was way better  obviously
Jul 21 2014,positive,it wasnt terrible but definitely could see a different actor for christian grey ryan phillipee maybe
Jul 21 2014,positive,not as good as it couldve been but a decent job overall not great decent
Jul 21 2014,positive,i thought it resembled the book i cant wait to see the next one
Jul 20 2014,positive,great movie just watched with my husband and i totally got blown away by it cant wait for the second one
Jun 25 2014,positive,very good movie but missing a few things from the book
Jun 22 2014,positive,if you think this flick would include intense erotica dont be afraid  like the book its more like an introduction into the bsm world  they focused more on the romance of the two main characters  maybe thats why i enjoyed the movie aaron not so much  innocence meets tormented hottie
Jun 19 2014,negative,i told myself id never watch this film but here i am and no i didnt pay to see it  its friday which means i have to review a bad movie fifty shades of grey is an erotic romance novel written by el james its widely known to be one of the most controversial books ever its one of the highest selling books in the world and is sadly labeled as american literature news that a film was being made was no surprise seeing as the book sales were extremely successful it has a colossal fan basemostly womenwho love the books and went to see porn together in the cinema fifty shades of grey is directed by sam taylorjohnson and stars dakota johnson jamie dorman and no one else worth mentioning     the plotif i may be so bold to call it thatis very simple a young woman named anastasia steele johnson fills in for her sick roommate by doing an interview for her she must interview christian grey dorman a successful businessman whos about as dull as a doormat they have the interview in his office ana bites her lip as he looks at her in the most creepy stare possible the two eventually end up forming a relationship she soon finds out christian is obsessed with sex and they spend the majority of the film experimenting and babbling on about an abusive sex contract     before i utterly slam this mostly horrible piece of garbage i want to praise some things first of all the best and only good performance in this film comes from dakota johnson she was very believable and likable to be quite honest she honestly gave a decent performance unfortunately she had to act next to an emotionless brick jamie dorman is a bad actor i will  not say it was the worst performance i have ever seen in a film ever thats simply not the case he was not as bad as the guy who screams oh my god in troll 2 he was however boring blank and honestly creepy    the film presents two main characters anastasia and christian are the two characters we must follow for two hours are they interesting not really no the book itself may differ from the film in this wayi doubt itbut the characters are mostly shallow they are very uninteresting for the majority of the film once again however i must applaud johnson for going full nude it takes allot to be that commited and professional obviously the novel is erotica therefore its mostly all about sex lots of sex the actual plot itself is centered on the sex i applaud any film that is daring and adventurous when it comes to being explicit however in the case of this film its all sex and zero substance     despite all the things that made me groan about this film one thing was impressive the cinematography i know im always talking about a movies camera work but this film quite honestly had beautiful camera work it was shot by seamus mcgarvey who has been the director of photography on several well known films such as we need to talk about kevin the avengers and godzilla his shots in this film are so stunning well lit and beautiful however this doesnt hide that horrible script it was written by kelly marcel who i dont wish to slam seeing as she wasnt given much to work with the horrendous vomit enducing dialogue is almost ever present its so generic it was like the sht dialogue youd hear in a porno     the final twenty to thirty minutes of this film frustrated me the most i feel this movie had an opportunity to go into the psychological reasoning behind greys obsessions he is extremely manipulative misogynistic and abusive anastasia is literally being used and abused yet she keeps coming back it emotionally scars her the film utterly refuses to inform the audience why she behaves this way it plays it off as sexy there were brief and fleeting moments where the film seemed like it would explore deeper more thought provoking psychological themes but it kept swatting them away     fifty shades of grey may not be the worst film of all time nor as horrible as i estimated it would be however it is a dull affair overall the cinematography is beautiful dakota johnson is very solid there are a couple of genuinely comedic lines and it skims the surface of some interesting psychological themes it is also boring emotionally flat poorly written and excessively annoying bdsm is also inaccurately portrayed if i had a dollar for every time johnson bit her lip id be a millionaire i found myself yelling at the screen please stop
Jun 18 2014,positive,kind of had a twilight feel to it but still went and seen it twice and whew they probably spent more on accessories for the red room than all the wardrobe budget combined
Jun 10 2014,positive,umyeahabout that   the books were much better though
Jun 10 2014,positive,very true and sometimes better than the book
May 22 2014,positive,it was eh it was like they were trying as hard as they possibly could to make it look like twilight they took great actors and made them rigid and stiff they took the whole lighting concept very lame
May 6 2014,positive,great movie and i cant wait to see part 2
Apr 27 2014,positive,i cant wait to see the movie
Apr 7 2014,neutral,i saw fifty shades of grey on opening night    it was ok  the book was definitely way better  the books are by no means bradbury stoker or bronte but they are cheap entertainment  when i looked at them that way i enjoyed them a lot more   jaime dornan was not a horrible christian but not great  dakota johnson was not a good anastasia  they looked awkward together and had very little chemistry  i will see all the movies but unless jaime and dakota show some actual attraction towards each other i am expecting more awkwardness in the next 2 films  they need to watch salma hayek and antonio banderas in desperado  that is what onscreen chemistry is supposed to look like 
Apr 2 2014,positive,brilliant film cannot wait for the rest x
Mar 29 2014,negative,from the moment that i saw the trailer for fifty shades of grey i knew that itd be bad i didnt know how bad it would be but i knew that it would be somewhere within the realm of bad now this movie surprisingly isnt a complete disaster it actually looks great and dakota johnson is pretty good but thats pretty much it the main problems with fifty shades of grey isnt just the dysfunctional and unhealthy relationship that it glamorizes but the fact that nothing happens in this movie its so boring at least in the twilight movies there was a larger conflict and the movie had a mythology eg the vampires vs werewolves conflict but there isnt anything else going on here other than bad dialogue and a lack of plot the first thing here is the dialogue most of which no one would ever say some of my favorite lines include i dont make love i fuck hard and whats a butt plug as well as im fifty shades of fucked up the conversations that people have here are ridiculous theres a small inkling of selfawareness here but its buried in the awful writing im sure that most of that has to do with the source material though but it doesnt change the fact that the writing here is clumsy and awkward i havent read the bookive only read a few passages of it because its hilariously awfulbut this movie does seem to make an improvement over its source material but again theres no saving this another problem is jamie dornan who has no personality whatsoever hes stilted awkward and uninteresting he has no chemistry with johnson the two of them feel like theyve been set up on a blind date the whole time with their lack of spark the movie itself is similar in that it doesnt lead to anything virtually nothing happens and the movie itself doesnt even have aahemclimax to it its just a cliffhanger of an alreadyunderdeveloped story for those who dont know fifty shades of grey was originally a twilight fanfiction and it shows the characters are just cut out from the twilight saga instead of original ideas it uses the weak female character tripe to further the plot and a really creepy relationship its not creepy because of bdsm its creepy because of christians possessiveness and sad because of anastasias inability to stand up for herself shes so weak and pathetic and the movie milks it for dramatic effect in between the boring stretches and sex scenes the movie just feels exploitative speaking of the sex scenesand how could you talk speak of themtheyre not interesting they just feel like filler with music video direction other than mentioning how theyre not responsible representations of bdsm there isnt anything to talk about here so while fifty shades of grey isnt the catastrophe that i thought that it would be its still really bad with its underdeveloped characters and bad dialogue matched with jamie dornans charismafree performance the only real saving graces are dakota johnson the cinematography and the soundtrack although the latter cant even be attributed to the movie itself and with its slow pace and lack of intrigue for two hours theres nothing that i can say actually warrants a viewing of it 3610 awful two thumbs down far below average etc
Feb 28 2014,negative,bad acting but jamie dornan was still good
Feb 27 2014,positive,if you read the book you will like the movie because you know why they say things that they say but if you didnt it could be very awkward
Feb 18 2014,positive,was a good movie but wasnt as good as the book  looking forward to the next two films
Feb 16 2014,positive,they keep it close to the book and like the director interpretation
Feb 15 2014,positive,there was a few important things that should have been in the movie but other than that is was good i loved it
Feb 10 2014,negative,even though i think the storyline is just stupid the main problem i found with this movie was the cast choice they seem to be so awkward with each other
Feb 9 2014,positive,for those that havent read the book this movie could turn out to be epically boring for those who are watching this movie for sex scenes it was probably a lot toned down then what youd expect     however for those that read the book and ignored all the kinky stuff and really focused on the love story this movie was perfect both dakota and jamie played their part just like how i invisioned christian and ana to be     a lot of the scenes had so much unsaid emotional meanings behind their every move you really had to have read all 3 books to understand and appreciate it     obviously the ending was dumb for first time watchers but you must wait for all 3 parts to be put together before you draw your final conclusion
Feb 1 2014,negative,hilariously bad writing and erotic scenes inspired by mel gibsons the passion of the christ made this stinker worth the price of admission
Dec 31 2013,negative,i tried to hold out hope with this film i really did i had read the fifty shades trilogy not the first book the whole fucking wretched trilogy and absolutely hated it in fact i think el james is one of the worst writers who has ever shat upon the page with her utter incompetency and complete lack of ideas or creativity it was a franchise rife with horrible dialogue uninteresting and retarded characters bland sex scenes and a whole host of other problems    that being said amid all the shitty writing there were still ideas the concept alone is rather intriguing a billionaire with a bdsm fetish and a dark past falls for a young college girl whom he pulls into his world of pleasures and secrets that concept should have made for a pretty interesting film    however to make this work the filmmakers would have had to scrap most of the source material because this is one of those rare cases where being faithful to the source material is the worst possible mistake they could make in fact letting el james have any sort of input was a horrible idea just give her the damn money for the film rights and then tell her to fuck off guess what decision the filmmakers made    it fails at being an artsy erotic film like last tango in paris in the realm of the senses lust caution shame american beauty 2046 or empire of passion it fails at being a trashy erotic film like fatal attraction basic instinct or the underrated disclosure it fails at being weird but oddly kinky film like under the skin or the 1996 david cronenberg film crash and it even fails at being so bad that its funny like showgirls passion basic instinct 2 or in the cut i enjoyed all of these films as im quite fond of artsy trashy weird and hilariously bad films but fifty shades of grey isnt remotely satisfactory in any of those categories its a great big crushing bore that isnt even sexy    what we have here is a terrible splicing of nineandahalf weeks which is quite underrated and twilight but the splicing ends up making for a worse film than it already sounds as much as i hated the first two twilight films they were still better than this its an ugly mangled car wreck of a film that is absolutely destroyed by its own source material    the story is set in the state of washington and we begin with the very boring character anastasia steele who has decided to do an interview with billionaire christian grey for her friend and roommate kate who is sick and cannot conduct the interview for their colleges newspaper    so instead of doing a phone interview for some reason ana drives all the way to seattle to grey enterprises to conduct the interview in person she is immediately greeted with all the bland decorations of the building which are comprised of whites and greys and the staff is comprised of slender women with blonde hair which creeps her out    upon entering his office she proceeds to trip and fall down and continues to bumble things by doing a bad job at asking questions and inappropriately dropping the are you gay question on him while making comments about his controlling methods    upon leaving she is strangely fascinated by this creepy unemotional man and he too is apparently smitten with a such a boring and very stupid girl she might read a lot of classic literature but thats a feeble attempt to make her seem smart ms james and he begins to pursue her even tracking her down at the hardware store where she works so he can buy ropes and cable ties    when he starts sending her gifts she becomes uncomfortable with his advances and tries to blow him off only to have him find her at a bar where he takes her back to his penthouse after she nearly gets raped by the obligatory jacoblike as in jacob from twilight if you dont know character for a friend    soon she becomes very smitten with him and she becomes further intrigued by his sexual fetishes which she decides she wants to explore so she enters a contractual agreement with him about what she can and cant do when shes in this particular dominantsubmissive relationship which includes how long she needs to sleep eating and exercising various sexual acts and a number of other things     after negotiating the terms of of the contract like omitting both anal and vaginal fisting the two dive into this world of sexual pleasures which is unfamiliar to ana as she is a virgin and her mental and physical states are challenged by both the sexual acts and christians erratic behavior she is also struggling with the fact that she wants a romantic relationship as opposed to a relationship that is purely sexual and tries desperately to get him to open up to her    soon her life becomes a whirlwind of strange sexual pleasures expensive gifts trips and emotional turmoil as she tries to unravel the mysterious christian grey    like i said the story has interesting ideas but the execution is very poor none of the characters are interesting especially the two  leads ana is one of the dullest characters ever portrayed on the screen and makes bella from twilight look like a strongwilled katharine hepburn of bette davis character by comparison i know that some people try to argue that the point of making this sort of character so devoid of traits is so the reader or viewer in this case can put themselves in the characters shoes but if im going to do that can i at least be put into the shoes of a character whose actually interesting not only is she bland but she is also quite stupid in her actions that constantly puts her in danger    i dont mind portrayals of good girls in films but this film is in desperate need of a bad girl sort of character to lighten the mood like a sharon stone sort of bad girl performance akin to her basic instinct performance if you will or she should have taken the route of the character sada abe from in the realm of the senses who was a woman consumed by the unending need to explore new heights in sexual pleasure even if it meant killing her lover or if we are to explore the good girl route she should have been more like wong chiachi from lust caution who finds herself caught in a deadly game of trying to seduce a dangerous government agent in order to assassinate him eventually    christian grey is also an extremely problematic character yes theres the whole issue of him being an abusive creepy stalker but hes also quite bland as a tormented character if i want a tormented male lead in an erotic film give me marlon brandos performance as paul in last tango in paris    in last tango in paris paul was tormented by his wifes suicide when he suddenly begins his secretive affair with the much younger jeanne as he pulls her into his world of strange provocative sexual desires go get the butter as a kind of coping mechanism for all his personal torments they dont give each other their names its just the anonymity and escape from their lives outside that apartment it was a brilliant performance and i will never forget paul because of all he went through and how his character is explored and developed by brando himself it was very personal and soulful however this sexual fantasy was not destined to last as the film explores the eventual tragic downfall and disillusionment from the fantasy in a heartbreaking finale    christian grey is simply not interesting whatsoever he feels like a cardboard cutout of a character rather than being human hes also a huge wuss of a character hell paul would probably slap the shit out of him call him a faggot and then steal ana away from him if he were in the film he is essentially nothing more than a wish fulfillment for the author in the midst of a midlife crisis when she wrote this series which is what makes him so boring and lifeless    the sexual component which is extremely essential for an erotic film is also quite bland nothing about the sex is particularly erotic and the story does a very poor job of exploring the mysterious and deemed taboo sexual practice of bdsm you learn nothing you are only bored and even a minimal reading into the subject causes you to poke holes in its portrayal of that practice    however those arent the only reasons the sexual components of the plot fail you see even in the dumber erotic films they still try to explore the emotional aspects on a deeper level the story also flops miserably in this category it never takes any real time to examine what makes the characters connect they are tethered by the authors bland sexual fantasies where almost nothing can go wrong you never see the connection you never believe the reasons and you simply never care    human sexuality while primal still comes with a lot of emotional components and psychological elements considering the premise of the story its very disheartening that it never goes beyond being a bland fantasy it should have been something much deeper and more complicated much like human nature is    however there are some bits from the novel that are thankfully omitted from the film adaptation you will not find any inner goddess bits bizarre use of british slang fewer foodcentric scenes and characters actually talk normally well as best they can with such wretched material you will not find much whispering or murmuring    unfortunately a whole lot more is needed to be removed before the story had any hope of being good it also still keeps baffling aspects like having scenes where the characters text and email each other instead of actual dialogue which is maddening and horribly boring also much like the novel you as the viewer get to read a large portion of the contract that ana receives fucking why im not entering this damn relationship plus much of what i complained about like the characters sexual aspects and overall plot structure are sadly identical to the source material    the acting is gasp horrible however i dont blame the actors for turning out such terrible performances you simply cannot make this source material work with all the stupid shit that happens and all the horrible dialogue bogging down the proceedings even if i went back in time and kidnapped my favorite actors and stuck them in this film it would still be a piece of shit    actually the only person who could have made this work is sharon stone because as roger ebert said in his review of basic instinct 2 she talks dirty better than anyone in the movies hell throw her in here doing a role similar to her role as catherine tramell in the basic instinct films id pay money to see that think about it a young billionaire with a bdsm fetish and a troubled past falls in love with a dangerous cougar with homicidal tendencies now that would have been a fun film    im sorry im distracted again if you havent noticed this film is very boring so you sometimes need to find other things to talk about anyways the poor actors blindly stumble their way awkwardly through the whole film with no chemistry or real enjoyment of the material theyre given you can tell that they really hate this material as you watch them perform dakota johnson tries to do something with her performance but jamie dornan completely checked out with his performance and had a very distinct i dont give a shit vibe surrounding him throughout the film    i can see why they would choose this sort of film its a very risque film and the sort of film that challenges actors to do things they had never done before that can end in victory or total failure then again even success is no guarantee of how it will further an actors career    i remember reading that dakota johnson wrecked her relationship with her father and grandmother actress tippi hedren of the birds fame because she agreed to star in a film with such subject matter and after this film im sure shell forever regret it regardless of her provocative interview statement i have no shame believe me youll forever have shame over this film ms johnson    this sort of film can also be a career wrecker particularly for actresses including established ones i mean look what happened to meg ryans career after in the cut for example hell the lead actresses in last tango in paris and in the realm of the senses had their careers and lives ruined by those films despite solid reception from critics and audiences so think about what sort of damage this will do to poor dakota johnsons career after its all said and done not to mention her personal life it could very well be devastating    in fact things have already gone haywire for the leads with both wishing they had not signed onto the film and jamie dornan badmouthing his costar its already a gigantic mess for the two however they shouldnt blame each other they should blame the script unfortunately they are trapped for the sequels and have no chance of escaping    as far as entertainment goes if you havent guessed already during this really long review i found this film to be tremendously boring and unsexy it falls flat as a drama because it is emotionally hollow the attempts at romance are sad and unintentionally creepy due to abuse issues the eroticism will leave you flaccid or dry and its a bad character study about two horribly boring people    overall do not see this film if you loved the book youll be happy to see that it remains quite faithful to the source material for everyone else avoid it like the plague ive already gone on in very very long detail about why i hate it so im in no mood to sum it up any more its not worth it
Dec 27 2013,positive,the books are good  and i like the movie    i cant wait see 50 shades darker  i hope they have the same actors 50 shades darker and  freed

Dec 11 2013,positive,it was so amazing and i love it
Dec 10 2013,neutral,i think the movie was actually comical unlike the book but i also think it was forced to go faster than it should have gone which made it less likable along with the characters not having chemistry at all
Nov 16 2013,positive,i finally walked into a movie that i had read the entire book series for heck i never read a single harry potter book  i didnt really hate the movie but i didnt love the movie although i thought the casting worked out well for christian and ana
Oct 28 2013,positive,the second greatest movie of all timesµµ
Sep 21 2013,positive,simply amazing cant wait until fifty shades darker
Sep 11 2013,negative,did anyone read this book it was obviously the delusional and ill informed musings of a 50something woman about how she thought 20something females live their lives newsflash  you literally cannot go to college in the united states without an email address that has been the case for 10 years cell phones yeah every college student has one of those too kinky sex yeah thats just called sex this never should have made it beyond its origins of crappy twilight fan fiction
Sep 7 2013,positive,in all honesty dakota johnson kept this movie barely afloat they didnt include anas work situation at all which was one of the reasons to read the series i believe jamie overacted in various parts of the movie he made his part ultimately unbelievable there wasnt any chemistry between the two main characters there were some cute lines but a vast majority of those lines are or were indeed cheesy  i was also expecting the ben wa balls and that was left out too no jack hyde in this film where was jack hyde oh and dont get me started on the legs that turned everyone in the theater off when they saw anas legs
Sep 2 2013,negative,i would more then likely rename this movie to 50 shades of stupid and unrealistic the story line if one even existed was boring the acting was mediocre it didnt even look like the two main characters had any chemistry that is an 1 hour and 50 mins of my life i will never get back i think britney spears and leonardo dicaprio would of been better off playing the main characters they probably would of had more chemistry seriously it was just repetitive i have read the book and it was way better on paper the way the movie was created it just didnt really make any sense i know sex sells and it was genius releasing this on valentines  day  but what a disappointment the ending by far was the worst i get there is going to be a second one but i mean come on it was just an overall disappointment i wouldnt even give it any stars it doesnt even deserve half a star
Aug 22 2013,positive,broadly based on the book but with more of a story
Aug 18 2013,neutral,i read the books and now that i saw the movie i realized how boring this story is very disappointed i wanted to fall asleep

Jun 10 2013,positive,entertaining jamie dornan needs to work on his acting skills dakota johnson is a much better actress than kristen stewart  im not afraid to admit i wish there had been more naughty scenes theyre honestly the only scenes that felt genuine and nothing about it screamed rape for the boycottersjust a bit of selfishness so many people gravitated toward it because they must be  on some level living out their own vicariously
May 12 2013,positive,the full version not the theatrical version
May 3 2013,positive,it wasnt as steamy as many people are thinking it would be actually it had some funny scenes in it johnson plays such a good character as anna i think the trilogy is better in book form

Mar 28 2013,positive,i saw this movie on february 13th which was my birthday and was totally blown away  i loved it as much as i did the books  really great job
Mar 26 2013,positive,welltheres two hours of my life down the tubesif you read the books dont waste your time if you didnt dont expect to have any clue about the plot so much of the plot was not in the movie and dakota sounded like a robot absolutely no chemistry between jamie and her its a shame that even though the books were mediocre at best and movie is way  below that it will still continue to break records
