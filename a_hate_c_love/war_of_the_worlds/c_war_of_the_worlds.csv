"Apr 12, 2024",positive," Sci-fi thriller based on HG Wells's novel, directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Tom Cruise. When aliens invade Earth, divorced dock worker Ray Ferrier attempts to save his estranged family from the rampaging extraterrestrials. Steven Spielberg's adaptation of the HG Wells classic, previously filmed in 1953, is a spectacular disaster epic of two halves. The first (and much the superior) hour is a masterclass in escalating tension, with grandiose and brilliantly executed sequences following in rapid succession - the bizarre lightning storm that prefigures the eruption of the alien Tripod war machines from beneath the earth is an astonishing opening salvo. Unusually for a special-effects blockbuster, the human drama is transfixing, as divorced dock worker Tom Cruise flees the invasion with his two estranged children (played by Justin Chatwin and Dakota Fanning). It's in the second hour that the story begins to wilt, most crucially when the suspense-evaporating CGI aliens are revealed. The imaginative details (a blazing train hurtling out of control, the river of dead bodies) also begin to peter out until a rather abrupt ending in which Hollywood schmaltz wins the day."
"Aug 5, 2022",positive," In Steven Spielberg’s science fiction, War of the Worlds remains something of an oddity. Its outlook on the prospect of human-alien interaction is bleak and stands as an antithesis to the director’s optimistic aliens in Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial, and even those alien-like robots at the end of A.I. Artificial Intelligence. And while it contains similar misgivings about technology as Spielberg’s Jurassic Park and Minority Report, it holds none of their purist fascination with the “science” of the story (aliens, heat-rays, and subterranean tripods are all very deadly). As a translation of H.G. Wells’ seminal alien invasion tale, the film moves the action from England to the United States and, while modernizing the source material, allows Spielberg to deliver a spectacle of alien destruction that, on the surface, sets aside his family-friendly label. But the adaptation maintains many of the original text’s most controvertible, arguably convenient flourishes so that, in spite of the film’s global cataclysm incited by world-conquering aliens, its epic scope remains centralized on a single family’s experiences during the takeover, and, therefore, it’s every bit as intimate as one would expect from Steven Spielberg. Spielberg’s film follows the long tradition of Wells’ seminal book and its many adaptations by standing as a reflection of scientific, social, or political events germane to its place in history. With his book, Wells had anticipated the end of the Victorian era and the worst potential dangers in the coming century where science and technology would rule supreme. Later adaptations only solidified that notion. In 1938, as radio listeners tuned-in to hear the usual rumblings of war in Europe with Hitler’s rise, Orson Welles sent half of New England’s listeners running for the hills with his legendarily realistic radio broadcast. Later, producer George Pal and director Byron Haskin made an effects-laden spectacular in their 1953 adaptation, The War of the Worlds, a film that played on the Red Scare and hoped for divine intervention. And Spielberg’s 2005 film, written by David Koepp and Josh Friedman, channeled 9/11 and consciously incorporated parallels to the then-current Iraq War still fresh in viewers’ minds. When one of the characters sees destruction all around her, aliens don’t enter her mind; she immediately asks, “Is it the terrorists!?” Skies fill with clouds as robotic machines topple entire cities, but Spielberg finds poignant moments of humanity in familiar images—such as a father running with his daughter in his arms, both covered in ash—images not unfamiliar for those versed in 9/11 (or any catastrophe’s) news footage. Its release was accompanied by a marketing campaign to match the larger-than-life collaboration between Hollywood’s most bankable director and its most popular star, Tom Cruise. The two had already worked together on Minority Report in 2002, but the global scale here was far more enormous. Millions were spent to produce and market the picture, and the posters showcased colossal letters that recalled the fonts from such past epics as Ben-Hur (1959) and King of Kings (1961). Six months before the film’s release, analysts predicted it would be the year’s biggest hit (it was fourth) and perhaps Spielberg’s largest earner—it’s certainly among his largest budgets. But just a few weeks before its Independence Day weekend opening on June 29, 2005, Cruise appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show, jumped for love on Oprah’s couch, and became something of a laughing stock in the public eye. His erratic behavior was vaguely attributed to his association with the unpopular Church of Scientology. Cruise’s promotional interviews centered on his newfound love with future ex-wife Katie Holmes, and the film itself was lost in the discussions. Some would argue that the public had grown weary of Cruise and, despite War of the Worlds’ stateside box-office take of $200 million, the film would have done better without the increasingly skewed perception of its star. At any rate, critical responses were equally circumscribed and seldom passionate, their assessments lost in the special FX, visceral nature, and sheer size of the experience over the characters and their emotional underpinnings, which is, oddly enough, what makes War of the Worlds far more lasting than any version before it. Andrew Sarris argued, “Overall, the film is too lacking in feeling to provide a recognizably human experience.” On the flipside, other critics expected a film of broader worldly scope as the title implies and felt the spectacle was lost in the entrenched humanity. Referring to the way the film avoids a typical blockbuster formula and does not require its heroes to save the day, the critic in The New York Post wrote, “This disappointing War of the Worlds limps to a conclusion that mercifully ensures there will not be a sequel.” Indeed, the film’s sci-fi logic and large-scale exhibition were less Spielberg’s concern next to his desire to create a familiar, iconographic atmosphere that the audience could not ignore on an emotional level. After all, Roland Emmerich had already made a worldwide alien invasion movie with Independence Day (1996), a film about blowing up monuments the world over. Spielberg’s film reminds us that amid the global horrors are personal stories about individuals. Perhaps Morgan Freeman’s off-screen bookend narration feels somewhat misplaced here, then. His voice of authority suggests something big is on the horizon. It opens the film and tells us aliens have watched our planet with envy and made plans, and at the end explains how the invading race is wiped out by ordinary microscopic Earth organisms to which humans are immune. In between Freeman’s grand observations, New Jersey divorcé Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise, in his most natural of performances) takes his rebellious son Robbie (Justin Chatwin) and anxious daughter Rachel (Dakota Fanning, excellent) from his ex-wife (Miranda Otto) for the weekend, and his rocky parent-child interactions continue even after an unearthly storm looms overhead. Near his disheveled bachelor pad, lightning strikes the same spot again and again, and suddenly all electricity from batteries to city power goes out, killed by an electromagnetic pulse. All at once, there’s a rumbling from under the city street surface at the lightning’s point of impact, and then the ground caves in, and from inside emerges a tripod—a three-legged robotic machine armed with heat-rays that reduce its victims to ash. Rattled, unequipped as a parent, and unsure what to do, Ray gathers his children, who take no comfort from their unnerved-but-trying father. Ray finds the last working automobile in his neighborhood and, with children in tow, sets out to find his ex. But crossing a displaced countryside wrought with tripod attacks, an airliner crash, geared-up military forces, and panicky masses primes Ray into a protective father mode. Along with Cruise’s damaged public profile in 2005, the film’s minor plot holes led to an underestimation of War of the Worlds. Even today, those searching for sci-fi logic in a film about a family’s survival question why a bystander is spotted recording the tripod on his digital camcorder after the aliens’ electromagnetic pulse zapped all electronics (but then, as viewers, we only assume the electromagnetic pulse; there is no scientist or resident expert in the film to explain what’s going on—we have to feel our way through it). Other debatably inconsequential plot holes occur, making it so the film may not stand up to microscopically close inspection, but such analyses overlook the sheer energy with which Spielberg has assembled his production—another driving force behind War of the Worlds. In that regard, the film has much in common with Jurassic Park, whereby captivating human characters run from a towering, deathly force, all delivered with great cinematic bravado. And within this nonstop scenario, Spielberg orchestrates moments of pure filmmaking that remain spectacular upon repeated viewings. Consider the deceptively simple sequence where Ray and his children navigate through stalled traffic in a minivan. Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski’s camera movements bob and weave passed stopped cars and hordes of stranded drivers, the frame whooshing in and out of the van thanks to CGI, circulating around what in another filmmaker’s hands might’ve been a dull sequence filmed entirely inside a car. Beyond moments where Spielberg echoes 9/11 imagery, he also makes incredible use of the tripods’ imposing stature. They tower over crowds or move through cities with vast, slow steps that implant them in the viewer’s memory as iconographic cinema—shots best described as epic and ambitious. But War of the Worlds is at its best when Spielberg breaks the massive scope to explore themes of family amid the frightened mob mentality prevalent throughout the film. There’s a microcosmic sequence where Tim Robbins appears as a paranoid survivalist named Harlan who makes deranged plans for a rebellion in the cellar of an old farmhouse, the scene serving as a metaphor for the entire picture. Harlan’s behavior incites Ray to blossom into a full-fledged protector after they narrowly avoid the alien equivalent to a fiberscope, and then an alien survey team. Ray is forced to fight and kill Harlan in fear that his loud ranting will alert the aliens. Cruise is excellent in these scenes and delivers a complete growth of character in his performance, emphasizing the film’s overarching theme of human bonding during and after a massive catastrophe (reflecting post-9/11 patriotism). Moreover, Cruise’s role is uncommon in Spielberg’s filmography, in that the director’s films usually concern families or children with absent father figures. Here, as in Minority Report, Cruise represents a deeply flawed father who, through the course of the film, restores some shattered levels of balance to his family. Even after Robbie seemingly dies in a wave of fire when he abandons Ray and Rachel to fight aliens with the U.S. Army, the film reunites Robbie in what some consider an all-too-convenient conclusion. Then again, this plot detail is drawn directly from Wells, who reunited the book’s narrator-protagonist with his presumed-dead wife by the last pages. American audiences accustomed to blockbusters of mass destruction in 2005 felt War of the Worlds was a letdown and wasn’t the crowd-pleasing, popcorn-munching, no-brainer that Independence Day was. Then again, it’s worth noting that the critics at France’s Cahiers du cinéma, usually ahead of the curve, put the film on their top ten list for the year—a curious choice for any film that’s just another blockbuster. Of course, no Spielberg film operates on one level alone, and this film is certainly no exception. Had the film’s marketing campaign not suggested another kind of film (of Roland Emmerich ilk) and focused instead on the deeply human struggle at its center, War of the Worlds may have been perceived differently. But Spielberg avoids grotesque cutaways to Paris burning, Rio de Janeiro’s Christ the Redeemer toppling over, or the White House exploding; his imagery is more affecting and invariably human, and his focus on a single family amid a worldwide conflict would inspire the narrative structures of later blockbusters such as World War Z and 2014’s Godzilla. Highly influential, ever innovative, and full of emotion and slick formal trickery, the film lives up to the precise definition of what “Steven Spielberg’s War of the Worlds” should be."
"Jul 29, 2022",positive,Cruise is in fine dramatic form and Spielberg's journey to the dark side is superbly realised. 
"Jul 9, 2022",positive," Steven Spielberg takes on the granddaddy of all alien invasion stories with War of the Worlds (2005), his contemporary adaptation of the H.G. Wells novel, fifty years after the first big screen version thrilled audiences. Tom Cruise is the screw-up of a divorced Dad emotionally cut-off from his kids who connects with his paternal instincts to protect his children (Dakota Fanning and Justin Chatwin) when his New Jersey neighborhood is assaulted by alien creatures that burst from the concrete streets and destroy everything—and everyone—within their reach. Spielberg is a master at staging both epic scenes of disaster and intimate moments of terror and triumph. The imagery is epic and the effects thrilling: the storms above the bridge by Ray’s New Jersey home, the cracking pavement as alien tripods rise from the ground and march through civilization like an invading army of spidery giants, the death rays that sweep the streets and leave dust where people once stood. The survival odyssey keeps is grounded in the family trying to survive the onslaught, giving us everything from their limited perspective in the midst of a nightmare. Cruise takes direction amazingly well and delivers an impressive physical performance as his failed father rises to the occasion and risks everything to protect his children from the invasion. But he still can’t manage to emote and he doesn’t allow the audience to connect to Spielberg’s strongest impulses: family, devotion, sacrifice for a loved one. For that, the film relies on young Dakota Fanning, whose wide eyes and little girl shrieks really express the sense of the world unraveling. Tim Robbins is memorable as a survivalist who saves Cruise and Fanning, only to fall prey to his own shock-induced obsession, Miranda Otto co-stars, and Gene Barry and Ann Robinson (stars of the original 1953 film) makes cameos as the grandparents.

"Oct 16, 2021",positive,"  From H.G. Wells to Philip K. Dick, the titans of sci-fi literature have been keeping filmmakers busy for decades. As Denis Villeneuve becomes the latest director to grapple with Frank Herbert’s epic Dune, we remember 10 times they struck gold. With its immense world-building, vast ensemble of characters and complicated mix of politics and religion, Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel Dune is almost a textbook study in the challenges of adaptation. Approached in the early 1970s, no doubt for his desert work on Lawrence of Arabia (1962), David Lean declined to head a film adaptation. As relayed in Frank Pavich’s documentary, Jodorowsky’s Dune (2013), Chilean cult director Alejandro Jodorowsky spent much time (and $2 million) developing a film version in the mid-1970s, only to run aground on his own improbable ambitions. Hollywood proved terminally resistant to his proposed running time of 10 to 14 hours. After Ridley Scott eventually abandoned another lengthy attempt to develop Dune into two films, Dino De Laurentiis hired David Lynch in what would be his first – and last – studio film, and his most compromised work. Without final cut, Lynch disowned the finished product (1984), which bombed critically and financially. Yet the results remain a mesmerising folly, merging the very different sensibilities of Herbert and Lynch into something rich and strange. John Harrison adapted the novel into a faithful, if somewhat flat and prosaic miniseries for Sci-Fi Channel that misses Jodorowsky’s and Lynch’s unworldly eccentricity. And now, fresh from the sci-fi of Arrival (2016) and Blade Runner 2049 (2017), Denis Villeneuve brings the first of his own two-part adaptation of Dune, with a possible third to cover subsequent novels. As we draw closer to the long-awaited UK release of Villeneuve’s Dune, here are 10 further science-fiction adaptations, charting a course through their transformation from text to screen. James Whale’s pre-Code sci-fi horror is adapted from two sources: Mary Shelley’s 1818 novel, whose author the opening credits demeaningly reduce to ‘Mrs. Percy B. Shelley’, and Peggy Webling’s 1927 stage adaptation of the same. Both these sources – one literary, one theatrical – are acknowledged in a work which is introduced by an on-stage narrator, but also shows Frankenstein’s fiancée Elizabeth reading from a letter (a nod to the epistolary form of Shelley’s novel). The adaptation is very free. The novel’s Victor Frankenstein is now called Henry (Colin Clive), although confusingly there is another, unrelated character here called Victor. Frankenstein now has a hunchbacked servant named Fritz (renamed Igor in later sequels), while the Monster (Boris Karloff) is an inarticulate brute. The climax takes place atop a blazing Bavarian windmill rather than the Arctic ice floes. Yet the film’s iconography would itself come to influence much subsequent horror. “Aladdin’s lamp in a physics laboratory!” comments Doc Ostrow (Warren Stevens), having just witnessed Dr Edward Morbius (Walter Pidgeon) use an alien mind-reading device to project an animated 3D image of his daughter Altaira (Anne Francis). It’s a line that exposes not only the proximity of science’s cutting edge to sorcery but more particularly the influence of fantastical literature (like the 17th-century Syrian storyteller Hanna Diyab’s Aladdin) on science fiction. Fred M. Wilcox’s future-set feature in fact owes its greatest debt to a rather different tale of wizardry. For in their shared exile on a distant planet, Morbius and his daughter resemble the similarly isolated Prospero and Miranda from William Shakespeare’s stage play The Tempest, while Robby the Robot and the ‘monster from the id’ evoke Prospero’s enchanted servants Ariel and Caliban. Only the arrival of an all-male (space) crew can break Morbius’s magical grip over the planet. In 1948, Arthur C. Clarke wrote his short story The Sentinel – concerning an alien artefact discovered on the moon – for a BBC competition, where it failed to place. He first published it in 1951 as Sentinel of Eternity. In 1964, director Stanley Kubrick started collaborating with Clarke on a new science-fiction film, inspired by The Sentinel and several other short stories by Clarke. Initially they planned to co-write a new novel followed by an adapted screenplay, but in fact both would end up being written concurrently, with the novel published (in Clarke’s name only) shortly after the film’s 1968 release – one year before the first actual manned lunar landing. This is an unusual case of book and movie co-developing and co-existing. There are many minor differences in their plot details, but, most significantly of all, Kubrick translates Clarke’s verbal work into a near wordless abstraction for the eyes. John W. Campbell Jr’s 1938 novella Who Goes There? (published under the pen name Don A. Stuart) will forever be associated with both Christian Nyby’s loose adaptation, The Thing from Another World (1951), and John Carpenter’s much more faithful rendering, The Thing (1982) – but barreling between these two sci-fi horrors was Eugenio Martín’s loco motion picture. Unfolding not on a contemporary Antarctic base but on the Trans-Siberian Express in 1906, this Hammer-esque Euro-horror pits two rival scientists (Christoper Lee!, Peter Cushing!!) against an alien entity, unearthed from an icy Manchurian cave, which leaps from one living host to another (including humans). Campbell Jr’s short story, though, never featured Polish nobility, an international spy, a cigar-chomping, whip-wielding Cossack officer (Telly Savalas) or a Rasputin-like mad monk (Alberto de Mendoza) all too eager to shift his holy allegiances to an extraterrestrial ‘Satan’. Robert A. Heinlein’s Hugo Award-winning 1959 novel Starship Troopers is a coming-of-age interplanetary war story whose future militarist Earth is either federal utopia or fascist dystopia according to the reader’s own ideological perspective – an ambiguity that has earned the work considerable controversy over the decades. The ever-subversive Paul Verhoeven unsurprisingly embraces this aspect in his adaptation, presenting his story as absurdly cheery recruitment propaganda, while simultaneously exposing in bold, bloody detail the abject horror of the humans’ cause. Playing like a parody of both Tony Scott’s Top Gun (1986) and television’s Beverly Hills, 90210 (1990-2000), Verhoeven’s film places chiselled, hormonal teens in the thick of a vicious battle fought on multiple fronts, and slyly suggests close parallels between the human characters and their insectoid enemy (who are made to seem as much victims as aggressors). Here the bestial brutality of US imperialism is shown from the inside. First serialised in 1897, H.G. Wells’ alien invasion novel The War of the Worlds has been famously adapted into Orson Welles’ 1938 radio broadcast, Jeff Wayne’s best-selling 1978 musical double album, a three-part Edwardian-era miniseries (2019) for the BBC, and various film versions (including producer George Pal’s 1953 feature). Steven Spielberg’s version, coming in the shadow of attacks on American soil on 11 September 2001, shows just how adaptable this myth is to contemporary preoccupations that Wells himself, for all his futurist concerns, could never have predicted. Showing an assault on the US from the ground up, the film strikes what for its time was a deeply subversive note by having its human hero strap explosive devices to his body in a campaign of guerrilla warfare and suicide bombing against an overwhelming force – all tactics of, precisely, the othered terror on which America had recently declared war. Philip K. Dick has proven to be one of sci-fi’s most lucratively adaptable authors, with his works the source for, among others, Ridley Scott’s Blade Runner (1982), Paul Verhoeven’s Total Recall (1990) and Steven Spielberg’s Minority Report (2002). Yet these were all rather loose reimaginings, whereas Richard Linklater’s 2006 feature cleaves very closely to Dick’s original 1977 novel, using genre (and a barely futuristic setting) as a ‘scramble suit’ to disguise its status as a semi-autobiographical elegy for the toll taken by drug addiction on Dick’s friends and himself in the early 1970s. With the same rotoscoping technique that he had used in his Waking Life (2001), Linklater transforms the faces of familiar stars into cartoons. It’s the perfect visual analogue for all the disorientation and dissociation of Dick’s novel, whose brain-altered burnouts have become alienated from the world around them and their own sense of self. Stanislaw Lem’s 1986 short story One Human Minute presents itself as a review of a miraculous, impossible book that reduces all human activities from a 60-second period to an exhaustive set of statistics. Both literary and meta-literary, Lem’s tale defines ‘unfilmable’ – and indeed a voiceover at the beginning of Pater Sparrow’s adaptation suggests, paradoxically, that the only consolation for the book’s existence is that “no one could make it into a film”. Sparrow sets his film in a despotic dystopia, and has the book suddenly appear overnight on the shelves of a closed second-hand book dealership. The increasingly alarmed authorities, scrambling to understand the origins, meaning and implications of the book’s destabilising content, detain all the store’s staff in a sanatorium repurposed for interrogation. The result is a mystery all at once of the locked-room, political and theological varieties, and an adaptation in no way merely by numbers. Born a century ago, Stanislaw Lem saw his 1961 novel Solaris adapted into three features (by Boris Nirenburg in 1968, Andrei Tarkovsky in 1972 and Steven Soderbergh in 2002), before his 2006 death. Ari Folman took the hallucinatory mindscapes of another Lem novel, 1971’s The Futurological Congress, and updated them to a new future where movie stars have been digitised by studios as ageless icons, and where everyone lives their dreams in a solipsistic virtual world of instant gratification. Lem’s male protagonist is replaced by ‘Robin Wright’ (the actual Wright playing a fictionalised version of herself), and her entry into the future’s layered, lysergic fantasia is marked by a switch from live action to cinema’s most plastic form, animation – here (as in Folman’s previous film, 2008’s Waltz with Bashir) used as much to conceal as to reveal reality. It’s a melancholic, meta-cinematic satire, set in an online world both within and beyond Lem’s imagination. An epic sci-fi odyssey (without the homecoming), Nobel laureate Harry Martinson’s 103-canto poem Aniara, published in 1956, has inspired several operas, a Swedish telefilm (1960), musical albums, and this feature from directors Pella Kågerman and Hugo Lilja, whose adaptation chimes with anxieties about the current course of our species expressed in the same year by Kim Ki-duk’s Human, Space, Time and Human and Claire Denis’ High Life. As Earth’s ecosystem collapses, the vast cruiser Aniara, taking affluent emigrants on a three-week voyage to the Martian colony, is accidentally sent off course and drifts into deep space. Now trapped in a second degrading ecosystem, the passengers and crew reorganise and form a new, regressive society, traversing the edge of infinity. Placing the human condition in a floating petri dish, this ode to entropy, emptiness and oblivion is, in keeping with its source, richly abstract and poetic."
"Feb 15, 2021",negative," Whatever commentary it may be on the present state of American studio filmmaking, Steven Spielberg remains one of its more skilled practitioners. He is one of the few capable of organizing script, actors, camera and effects in such a fashion that his concerns are communicated in an entertaining fashion to large numbers of people. Unfortunately, he is not burdened with great or important ideas, so that while the undertaking is often successful in the more immediate sense, it generally fails to perform the larger tasks confronting art and filmmaking. One knows, more or less, what to expect. If there has been a darkening in Spielberg’s films recently, with Artificial Intelligence, Minority Report and now, War of the Worlds, this must be attributed to growing concerns within certain social layers about the state and direction of American society. All is clearly not well. Again, however, the gloomier vein has not yet yielded extraordinary insights. The filmmaker always seems, in the end, too complacent and too canny to make the kind of effort it takes to get to the bottom of things. Spielberg’s War of the Worlds is loosely based on the 1898 science fiction novel by H.G. Wells (1866-1946) about a remorseless attack by Martian invaders on the Earth’s population. Wells, author of The Time Machine (1895), The Island of Dr. Moreau (1896), The Invisible Man (1897) and The First Men in the Moon (1901), apparently had several, perhaps conflicting concerns in mind with his The War of the Worlds. On the one hand, the author, an evolutionary socialist, identifies the English victims of the alien invasion with animal species, “such as the bison and the dodo,” upon which the human race has wrought “ruthless and utter destruction,” as well as the “inferior races,” such as the Tasmanian aboriginals, “entirely swept out of existence in a war of extermination waged by European immigrants, in the space of fifty years.” This ambiguity—are the invaders a monstrous “Them,” or are they, in fact, a no less monstrous “Us”?—hardly finds a place in Orson Welles’s notorious 1938 radio version, which resonated with the rise of Nazism, or the Byron Haskins-George Pal 1953 film featuring Gene Barry and Ann Robinson (who have cameo roles in Spielberg’s work). The latter, quite spectacular and entertaining in its own way, has Cold War and religious overtones. In the newest rendition of Wells’s story, in my view, the degree to which that ambiguity is treated or neglected largely determines the success or failure of the work. Screenwriter David Koepp and Spielberg have transposed the drama to contemporary America. Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) is a New Jersey dockworker, divorced, with two children. In a rather clichéd fashion, the filmmakers portray Ferrier as an irresponsible soul, perhaps more attached to his automobile than his offspring. Predictably, events will put him to the test and “family values” will triumph. Alien fighting machines, newly activated, come out of the ground, where they have been stored for eons. They immediately wreak devastating havoc. With one of the few working automobiles, Ferrier heads for his ex-wife’s house in the suburbs and, when she proves to have left for her parents’ home, eventually for Boston, several hundred miles away. En route, Ferrier, his young daughter (Dakota Fanning) and recalcitrant teenage son (Justin Chatwin) encounter, along with the general population, more than their share of terrors and horrors. The intruders from another planet are intent on exterminating Earth’s population or breeding them for feeding purposes (the vampirish element is present in Wells’s original book). In the end, the aliens succumb, as they do in the previous versions of the story, to a surprising nemesis. The initial scenes, of Ferrier and his family fleeing incomprehensible death and destruction, are affecting. The attempt to recreate something of the impact of the September 11 attacks on the lives of ordinary people is a legitimate one. Spielberg is someone who can do this sort of thing. The sight of the Bayonne Bridge collapsing in the background or bits of clothes and body parts floating through the air is disturbing and frightening. Effective as well are the sequences of refugees trudging down roads and highways, desperately seizing Ferrier’s car, fighting for a place on a doomed ferry. At the same time as the Americans are victims, along with the (unseen) rest of the world’s population, there are hints of other realities. Ferrier’s son is writing a paper on the French in Algeria; a sinister survivalist (Tim Robbins) tells Ferrier, “Occupations never work. History has taught us that a thousand times.” The disproportion between the military might of the invaders and that of the humans suggests nothing so much as the present situation in Iraq or Afghanistan, with Cruise attempting at one point to become a “suicide bomber.” These hints are clearly intentional. Spielberg told a press conference: “But I just felt that this movie is a reflection and there are all sorts of metaphors that you can certainly divine from this story...this movie I was hoping would be more like a prism. Everybody could see in a facet of the prism what they choose to take from the experience of seeing War of the Worlds, so I tried to make it as open for interpretation as possible, without having anybody coming out with a huge political polemic in the second act of the movie.” As opposed to Roland Emmerich’s Independence Day, which borrows much of the structure of Wells’s novel, but transforms it into a rousing tribute to American militarism and chauvinism, Spielberg and Koepp have kept the jingoism to a relative minimum. The latter told a reporter, “People might use this version of War of the Worlds as a mirror to reflect what they already believe. Some people will look at it and say it’s clearly about post-9/11 American paranoia: terrorism and our fear of terrorism, sleeper cells waiting to be activated. Some people will feel that because Americans already feel victimized and threatened. People elsewhere in the world, who also feel victimized and threatened, might say it’s about Iraq and their fear of an American invasion.” The notion that Americans can be both victims and victimizers is perhaps not the alpha and omega of political understanding, but it might be the starting point for critical thought. The film’s ambiguities are enough to have earned the wrath of the extreme right. A “left-wing propaganda piece against the war on terror” is what one hostile commentator terms it. And these ambiguities could not slip past the ever-vigilant Edward Rothstein, “culture critic-at-large” for the New York Times, who can generally be counted upon to contribute his rather filthy two cents. Rothstein compares Spielberg’s effort unfavorably with Wells’s, remarking that “there is a strange ambivalence in the film, as if the issues surrounding responses to such [terrorist] attacks made Mr. Spielberg uneasy.... The movie also keeps trying to ward off the spirit of militarism the situation elsewhere requires. Mr. Robbins’s character is a twisted militant, hapless, disturbed and dangerous. Tom Cruise’s advice against attacking a Martian in a basement is just common sense, but when, near the movie’s end, he urges a soldier not to shoot, it seems as if some other message were being italicized.” Rothstein goes on to register other, perhaps more burning concerns: “Some of this may be related to the movie Mr. Spielberg interrupted to make War of the Worlds. It is said to begin with the murders of Israeli Olympic athletes by Palestinian terrorists in 1972—an attack Martian-like in its ambitions. But the analogy, Mr. Spielberg’s comments suggest, will be undermined: injustices suffered by the attackers will need to be understood and their victims’ tactics questioned.” The Times columnist adds, “Perhaps that idea of terrorists with a cause and defenders with doubts influenced the discomfort felt in the current film as well.” Spielberg’s “strange ambivalence,” uneasiness and “discomfort” to which Rothstein refers contemptuously (with implications that the filmmaker is “soft” on terrorism) make up the strongest element of War of the Worlds, the most human element. That Rothstein praises the “spirit of militarism” and disdains the protagonist’s urging of a soldier not to shoot is a commentary on the generally brutalized mentality of the erstwhile American liberal intelligentsia. Contrary to Rothstein, the great weakness, ultimately, of the film is that its ambivalence, unease and discomfort about American realities in general and the “war on terror” in particular are not placed in the forefront, developed or worked through to the end. In fact, the artistic and dramatic failings of the work are to a certain extent, perhaps largely, traceable to Spielberg’s (and presumably Koepp’s) tentativeness and timidity in regard to these critical questions. Having established, in a relatively artistic and potentially rewarding manner, a connection, a resonance between the re-imagined episodes of Wells’s novel and contemporary events (Americans “under attack,” refugees in their own country), the filmmakers largely fail to follow up on their accomplishment. Admittedly, the task was somewhat challenging: how to remain faithful (at least in spirit) to the original story, while continuing to hint at parallels between the science fiction narrative and our reality. Well, something could have been done. As it is, the film largely stops in its tracks, or goes off in an entirely wrong direction. Oddly enough, adherence to the original, more or less, proves to be the means by which the filmmakers manifest their inability or unwillingness to treat concretely the more controversial and complex aspects of the present situation—in other words, precisely to advance their own ambivalence, uneasiness and discomfort. In this case, such adherence proves to be the line of least resistance. (Fidelity to Wells’s tale, which in any event is not such an imperishable classic, would seem to be a secondary matter.) As a consequence, the characters’ plight becomes entirely abstract (more and more divorced from any present-day reverberations) and the film turns into a rather conventional, if exceptionally macabre, horror-science fiction film. The promising hints and ambiguities are largely abandoned. As happens far too often these days, having reached an artistic or intellectual impasse, Spielberg and Koepp rely on the monstrous, the morbid, the grotesque (or special effects). Latter portions of the film are simply distasteful without adding any particular insight. One is left disturbed by the film, with a bad taste in one’s mouth, but not necessarily for the right reasons, or about the right things. And that was not inevitable."
"Nov 9, 2020",positive," o one in the 21st century would have believed that Earth was being watched by intelligences greater than their own, for potentially millions of years. Humanity, as it reached its peak, was always too caught up in their infinite complacency, confident of supremacy over the planet. But in the cold, dark reaches of space, aliens have been plotting to take the valuable resources of this planet … by force. With a war of the worlds looming, Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) is the perspective of commonplace sensibility. He’s a crane operator at a shipyard, dependable above and beyond his coworkers, but still observant of union rules. And he struggles to provide for his two children, Rachel (Dakota Fanning, playing the perfectly precocious voice of reason) and Robbie (Justin Chatwin, donning the role of angsty, rebellious teen), while also hoping to bond with them and appear as a role model. But both are problems, considering that he’s divorced, sharing custody of the kids with his ex-wife Mary Ann (Miranda Otto), and competing with their wealthy stepdad Tim (David Alan Basche). “You’ve got nothing to worry about.” When Mary Ann drops the siblings off with their father for the weekend, Ray plans for an uneventful couple of days; after all, he’s a working man, and he needs his sleep. But before the day is through, a storm mysteriously materializes overhead, lashing out with freakishly antagonistic lightning bolts, forcing Ray and Rachel back into the house. When curiosity gets the better of Ray, he races into the center of town to investigate the commotion and the pinpoint target of all the electrical strikes. The initial alien appearance is unmistakably reminiscent of “Independence Day,” as furious clouds swirl above, hinting at an extraterrestrial invasion. But when the invaders do arrive, they come from beneath the ground, springing up on thin, nimble legs like mechanical octopi (or tripodal automatons). The level of destruction also matches that aforementioned sci-fi thriller, with buildings rupturing and cars getting tossed about as infrastructure crumbles. It’s also quite sudden. The action and adventure is quite significant, especially as panic takes hold and the attackers begin razing everything in sight. It’s here that some of the most memorable sets are designed, with a massive plane resting in sections across a lawn as the best of the bunch (though the wreckage conveniently leaves their parked van untouched), and when images of chaos and catastrophe are most potent (including a stream full of drifting bodies or articles of clothing raining from the sky). As if predicting the rise of the modern zombie craze, director Steven Spielberg’s vision of an alien takeover includes understandable paranoia, uncontrollable crowds of confused and violent survivors (and sprawling fleers), and the very worst qualities of humanity emerging triumphant (even for the protagonist, who is forced to make tough moral decisions concerning his family’s survival). As with most of his ventures, the film also puts children directly in the path of the annihilation, imparting a sense of innocence and greater unpreparedness, with parenting efforts a key point of contention and drama. Expectedly, adults are just as impulsive, incompetent, and ineffective as the screaming youths. Unfortunately, this somewhat realistic portrayal results in plenty of annoying moments as characters behave contrarily to larger-than-life heroes (and leads to an ending that can’t match the riveting start). But the carnage is more colossal than in most disaster movies, the sound effects are chilling, the sets are spectacularly ominous, the CG is impressive, and the desperation is more psychologically trying (though the PG-13 rating creates obvious limitations for the visualized atrocities). It may not be a masterpiece, but it’s a fitting adaptation of a seminal H.G. Wells sci-fi epic.

"Sep 11, 2020",positive,"War of the Worlds pulses with excitement, danger and palpable nervous energy that generates a legitimate and lasting awe."
"May 17, 2020",positive," In 1898 H.G. Wells wrote a novel called The War of the Worlds.   It told the fictitious story of an alien invasion taking over the earth.  In 1938 Orson Welles infamously narrated a radio broadcast of the ""invasion"" but since many listeners tuned in later they missed the announcement at the beginning of the shows stating the news broadcast wasn't real.  Mass hysteria ensued as the public really believed the Earth was being invaded.  Since then there have been numerous adaptations including television series, video games, comic books, and seven films. In 2005, Steven Spielberg (Raiders of the Lost Ark) helmed one of War of the Worlds films starring Tom Cruise (Top Gun).  On May 19th, for the 15th anniversary of the movie, Paramount Pictures is releasing it on 4K. Ray Ferrier (Cruise) is a blue-collar worker and a divorced father of two, Rachel (Dakota Fanning; Man on Fire) and Robbie (Justin Chatwin; Taking Lives).  When his ex-wife (Miranda Otto; The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers) drops them off for a typical weekend visit, it is an average yet tension-filled exchange.  However, when a massive storm filled with lightning strikes disrupts power, it is only the beginning of a terror crammed a few days.  Those strikes, unbeknownst to the citizens of the world, were really alien transports to deliver the hostiles to their killing machines that were buried underground long ago.  Suddenly, cities all over the world are under attack against forces they can't possibly defeat.  These machines. At first, they are vaporizing people then suddenly they start capturing them, sucking out their blood from giant looking straws and then painting the countryside with the blood to use as fertilizer for their vegetation.  Ray must find a way to keep his kids safe as they travel to meet up with his ex-wife at her parents' home in Boston. Cruise, unlike many of his characters, plays somewhat of a jerk in this film but also portrays a quick-thinking individual who genuinely cares about his kids though he doesn't always show it.  Even at a young age, Fanning showed great potential as an actress here as we watch while she is practically forced to grow up almost overnight.  Chatwin plays a typical brooding teenage boy who challenges his father at every turn.  Tim Robbins (The Shawshank Redemption) plays Harlan Ogilvy, a deranged man who initially offers Ray and Rachel shelter but then goes crazy once he sees what the aliens are doing. The suspense keeps your heart pounding while the visuals are appealing to the eye.  If you are a fan of the genre this is one movie you should add to your collection.

"Nov 18, 2019",positive," Tom Cruise may be making headlines with his recent behavior, but even Cruises bad boy antics cant sink War of the Worlds. The Steven Spielberg adaptation of the H.G. Wells novel features plenty of chills and thrills, making it one of the summers big-ticket releases that actually lives up to the hype. Cruise plays Ray, a dock worker and divorced dad trying to connect with his estranged children (Justin Chatwin and Dakota Fanning) during a weekend visit. The familys struggles take a back seat when a bizarre lightning storm proves to be the precursor to an attack by beings from another world. Cruise carries the picture, and even manages to make me forget about the fact that he might be having a very public mid-life crisis. Fanning is fine, but I cant help but think her career goes out the door when she reaches adolescence. Spielberg does a masterful job of building the tension and creating an effective science-fiction thriller. The films strongest moments come during two edge-of-your-seat sequences. The first attack is the films best, which really had me anticipating what was going to happen next. That sequence is nearly topped by an attack on a ferry that reminded me a lot of the final half of Titanic with its panic-induced hysteria combined with jaw-dropping destruction. These two scenes really push the envelope when it comes to the films PG-13 rating this isnt a movie for younger children but it helps enhance the effectiveness of the films rather grim feel. War of the Worlds does suffer from a disappointing final act. The usually reliable Tim Robbins is slightly out of place in a small role and the wrap-up seems rushed and rather convenient. Still, its much more satisfying than Spielbergs A.I. which left most audiences feeling frustrated and cheated. War of the Worlds doesnt reach the heights of Spielbergs last collaboration with Cruise, Minority Report, but it still sets the bar pretty high. With the exception of Star Wars, this may be the summer seasons best high-profile event. This weeks discount dud is The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy (C) an average science-fiction adventure that probably will appeal more to the fans of the popular book and BBC mini-series that the film is based on. The plot is simple. Brit Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman) is rescued by his friend, an alien in disguise, Ford Prefect (Mos Def), right before Earth is destroyed. There were moments in Hitchhiker where I was mildly amused, including a musical number by dolphins right before they leave Earth, but for the most part, the dry British humor just fell flat. It was like watching a gag reel of all the Monty Python moments that didnt work. Part of the problem could have been the cast. Freeman and Mos Def just arent that dynamic in their respective roles. Hitchhiker does throw in small parts for John Malkovich and Bill Nighy, as well as speaking parts for Helen Mirren and Alan Rickman, but none is given enough screen time to connect. The best performance comes from Sam Rockwell, who plays the president of the galaxy as sort of a cross between George Bush and Jim Morrison. But even Rockwell isnt enough to prevent this from being middle-of-the-road. I can respect what everyone involved was trying to do in The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, but that doesnt mean I have to like it or recommend it to anyone else. The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy opens Friday at the Plaza 6, where all movies are $1.50.

"Jun 5, 2019",positive,"Moves from one action set piece to another, seeing everything only through the eyes of its main characters, and in doing so avoids many sci-fi clichés."
"Aug 21, 2018",positive," Steven Spielberg’s War of the Worlds is a movie at once authentically unsettling and deeply nostalgic. The nostalgia is for scary, long-cherished fantasias concerning alien invasions and men from Mars as filtered through boyhood comic books and drive-in movies and tattered paperbacks, a whole century of cheap thrills summed up and transfigured in a return to their primal source, H.G. Wells’s 1898 novel. But Spielberg doesn’t try to reproduce the camp goofiness of Mars Attacks! or the video game hijinks of Independence Day: he wants us to care about what is happening in front of us, as if we were contemplating this scenario for the first time. That would require a return to childhood, a return to the childhood of the genre to which he has devoted so much of his energy and to whose historical permutations he can (and in this movie does) allude almost reflexively. (In passing I registered fleeting, virtually subliminal hints of The Birds, Alien, Night of the Living Dead, The Day of the Triffids, Panic in Year Zero, Quartermass and the Pit, and The Poseidon Adventure, not to mention Spielberg’s own Jurassic Park, whose raptor in the kitchen is paralleled here by aliens in the basement.) We would need to feel again how much our nostalgia is imbued with real terror, even if it was a terror at one remove, just distant enough that we were able to play inside it. War of the Worlds aspires to be a compendium of Wells and all that sprang from Wells, an all-in-one package that might serve as something like a child’s introduction to cosmic fear. It feels inevitable that the movie should come to revolve around the haunted face of a child, the inscrutably traumatized ten-year-old played (with an intensity in itself rather disturbing) by Dakota Fanning. The world seems particularly expendable in Spielberg’s opening scenes when we see it from the vantage point of Tom Cruise’s Ray Ferrier, a New Jersey dockworker living in disordered solitude since his wife left him, and brimming with hostility at the prospect of being dumped with the kids while his ex goes off for the weekend with her new partner. (Cruise, in a performance more restrained than he has been giving on television lately, manages capably his character’s journey out of sullenness into the sustained urgency that the rest of the picture requires of him, but it is not a role that calls on much range.) Spielberg’s foray into kitchen-sink realism conjures up a mood of dead ends, of life as a continual round of taunting and bickering in prefab houses. Imagine the movie continuing in this vein without the arrival of the aliens. In the event—no surprise—the extraterrestrial invasion will provide a chance for some real quality time enabling Ray to discover that he does actually care whether his children live or die. This family drama seems too calculated an interpolation, fulfilling too neatly the Hollywood requirement that all movies must involve the “redemption” of at least one central character. The H.G. Wells novel followed a more austere and solitary course, as its anonymous hero mostly hid out and watched from the sidelines while the disaster unfolded. He was there as an observer; it was the fate of the race that was in question. Here we are often distracted from the magnitude of the catastrophe by worrying about what will happen to Ray, his teenage son, and his ten-year-old daughter, as if—with inescapable movie logic—the fate of the rest of humanity took second place to Ray’s need to establish a good relationship with his kids and get them safely back to their mother in Boston. It is hard to work up much interest in a redemption that is a foregone conclusion; but it doesn’t matter much since the overwhelming speed and scale of the events that overtake this family unit leave them blessedly little time for extended conversation. After the son runs off to join up with the soldiers who are counterattacking the aliens—the dialogue suggests a floating analogy with the Iraq war—we are down to father and daughter, with Cruise hoarsely singing the Beach Boys’ “Little Deuce Coupe” as a consoling lullaby in the face of ultimate horror, and Fanning beginning to take on the aura of a designated martyr for humanity in general in a world where the worst suffering is to survive. 
  Those who have escaped the dark and terrible aspects of life will find my brutality, my flash of rage in our final tragedy, easy enough to blame…. But those who have been under the shadow, who have gone down at last to elemental things, will have a wider charity.
 Spielberg enacts a comparable scene in which Ray is forced to kill the raving survivalist (played rather hammily by Tim Robbins) who has offered them refuge, and must blindfold his daughter so that she catches no glimpse of the act. The blindfolded eyes serve to underscore the recurring image of Dakota Fanning’s wide-open eyes elsewhere in the film, while the matter-of-fact bluntness of the offscreen killing weighs more heavily than the explosions, fireballs, and flying debris that accompany the advancing aliens. It’s a bleak and rigorous moment that offsets the impulse, here and there indulged, to unleash the special effects for the full summer blockbuster joyride. War of the Worlds is scary in all the places where it’s supposed to be: in the splitting apart of the pavement as the aliens—planted underground long ago—first emerge, in their attack in their giant tripods on the ferry boat trying to cross the Hudson to evade them; in the exploratory twisting of the aliens’ extensible observation arm through the basement where the humans cower silently. Spielberg does this sort of thing as well as any director ever has, and still seems to enjoy it. The catastrophe is delivered as promised: as it must be, to fulfill the promise of an adrenaline-fueled theme park ride to keep the American summer—not to mention the American movie business—alive. Some of the most efficiently scary scenes—that arm in the basement, for instance, which is milked for all it’s worth—serve as something like comfort food, reassuring us that we’ve seen this sort of thing before but that this time it’s going to be better than ever. Yet the movie is full of indications that Spielberg wants if not to spoil the fun then at least to complicate it, to lace it with a dash of what might even be anguish. He wants to let something of the real world in, most markedly through visual echoes of September 11 and its aftermath. On one hand the movie is a game, a conscious display (if we needed it at this stage) of Spielberg’s technical mastery; on the other it reaches toward what might be prophecy, or passionate allegory, or exhortation to mindfulness of real human suffering. This is where the unsettling part comes in, because for all his deliberateness as a filmmaker Spielberg cannot altogether control the undertones of despair and gnawing anxiety that his images elicit. That conflict between uncomplicated fun and real-world grief can hardly be resolved in Spielberg’s movie, but the pressure it creates finds its outlet in certain images of exceptional beauty. It’s in the scenes of the Martians themselves, and the devastation they wreak, that Spielberg finds a way out of his dilemma in vistas that have the solemnity of one of John Martin’s Victorian tableaux of the Day of Judgment. He plants the alien tripod machines, with their annihilating heat rays and their spindly legs that flex like tendrils—with a dedicated fidelity to the descriptions of H.G. Wells that make them look positively antique—into a world just drab and wounded enough to pass for real. The aura of virtual historical reality that Spielberg labored to create for the ghetto takeover in Schindler’s List or the Omaha Beach landing in Saving Private Ryan is here imparted to an invasion that might as well be historical: the devastation of twenty-first-century New Jersey by illustrations from a Victorian scientific romance. These almost fussily perfect vistas, like the extraordinary moment when the alien machines are seen from a distance standing knee-deep in the Hudson to feed on their human prey, evoke a peculiar kind of history painting: Landscape with Tripods, perhaps, an exercise in the Spielbergian sublime, where what devastates us does, from a certain angle, possess an undeniable abstract beauty. These spacious set-ups have a gaudy splendor far removed from the cramped dullness of the ordinary world on which the aliens intruded, a world in which the sole note of aesthetic liveliness was provided by a children’s cartoon show. The effect is of reliving scenes we experienced in the novel, in Orson Welles’s notorious radio play, in the comic book, and in the 1953 movie version, but with the suggestion that this time they’re really at hand. We have arrived at that apocalypse so assiduously imagined in all its variations for the last hundred years: the foundering of the everyday and its shockingly abrupt replacement by a different order of things, an order from which there can apparently be no more than a temporary escape. Earth is overgrown with red alien weeds. The movie fulfills itself in such images, even if it cannot sustain their mood into the final scenes. Spielberg is faithful to the rough outline of the novel—the sudden collapse of the aliens and the revelation that they have died from exposure to Earth’s bacteria—but he cannot give it the solemnity of Wells’s last pages. Here the wrap-up seems almost as perfunctory as one of those Fifties sci-fi movies where the air force discovers, say, that the flying saucers are susceptible to high-frequency noises and saves the planet in the last five minutes. The difference is that in Wells the protagonist walks through a dead and emptied London—“The windows in the white houses were like the eye sockets of skulls”—and is utterly alone when he hears the wailing of the dying Martians: “Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla.” The scene, like many in the novel, has an uncanny poetry that in Spielberg’s version is crowded out by the mob of onlookers and soldiers who make nonsense of the idea that the human race has come close to extinction. 
  By the toll of a billion deaths man has bought his birthright of the earth, and it is his against all comers; it would still be his were the Martians ten times as mighty as they are. For neither do men live nor die in vain.
 But this is a passive victory, a triumph of evolutionary biology. And further on, characteristically, Wells’s narrator changes course again. After indulging a reverie about human life “spreading slowly from this little seed bed of the solar system throughout the inanimate vastness of sidereal space,” he brings himself up short: “It may be, on the other hand, that the destruction of the Martians is only a reprieve. To them, and not to us, perhaps, is the future ordained.” Wells’s narrator follows this with an observation that might be the unspoken epigram of Spielberg’s movie: “I must confess the stress and danger of the time have left an abiding sense of doubt and insecurity in my mind.” The doubt and insecurity permeate the film, even if the director acknowledges, with a final scene of the family all safely reunited, that there might be a limit to how much insecurity his audience will tolerate. In H.G. Wells’s novel the narrator who tells us of the Martian invasion refers to his subject as “the great disillusionment.” Spielberg’s theme will, I suppose, be described by some as the loss of innocence, the American innocence that has been lost so many times only, apparently, to regenerate so that it may be lost yet again. The innocence lost in his film would be a lack of awareness of just how vulnerable we are to destruction by unknown forces. Wells’s “disillusionment” is much broader in its scope, just as his novel contains within it the seeds of a thousand variations, including the 1953 film produced by George Pal with its ambience of nuclear terror, graphic interpretations by artists ranging from Edward Gorey to Lou Cameron (whose comic book version for Classics Illustrated, soon to be reissued, is a model of spareness and restraint),* a rock opera in the Seventies, and the 1938 radio production by Orson Welles, which persuaded a good many unwary listeners that they were hearing live breaking news reports of Martian invasion. The novel has not been exhausted, being one of those open-ended works that combine infinite suggestiveness with the most rudimentary of narratives. The Martians are more intelligent than we are; they arrive and devastate us as men would tread on an anthill; we would without question be destroyed except for that lucky business of the bacteria the Martians somehow failed to anticipate. Everyone remembers certain instants in Wells’s book—the first sighting of what appears to be a falling star, the discovery of the cylinder, the first encounter with the power of the Martian heat ray—but as far as plot goes the novel is monotonous in the extreme. The monotony comes from the scenes of wartime suffering that from his vantage point Wells could only imagine. Essentially the Martians go from place to place and destroy everything they find. The humans flee or resist in vain, despair, loot, get drunk, die miserably, hide out in coal cellars. One day it ends. Because the story is so simple that it can be told in a single sentence, Wells tells it again and again, each time from a different angle. His anonymous narrator—a writer with scientific interests, apparently, comfortably settled in suburban Woking, Surrey, with a wife from whom he is separated for most of the book and an equally sketchy brother, inserted none too artfully, whose sole function is to provide eyewitness testimony of events taking place in London—is not so much a character as a mind set adrift by circumstance. What is most striking in rereading The War of the Worlds is how swiftly its moods and angles of vision can lurch from point to point. Adaptations inevitably smooth over the book’s texture, which is the result of thought revising itself, of emotions mutating unpredictably, of viewpoints turned on themselves. Likewise Wells’s prose can dart from sermonic eloquence to notation as dry as a railroad timetable. The confident assertions of nineteenth-century thought give way to a stammering bluntness as the narrator finds himself unable to tell others what has happened: “I felt foolish and angry. I tried and found I could not tell them what I had seen. They laughed again at my broken sentences.” The book has so often been turned to graphic and cinematic uses that it is easy to forget the changes it works in language alone. What Wells’s narrator meditates on is a game devised by Wells himself, with a measure of detachment verging on the misanthropic. In his Experiment in Autobiography he described how he “wheeled about the district marking down suitable places and people for destruction by my Martians.” The book might then be imagined as the soliloquy of a man who bicycles through the suburbs of 1890s London imagining their devastation, along with the devouring of their inhabitants by blood-drinking aliens. A secret antisocial fantasy is played out with the enthusiasm of a schoolboy moving pins around on a war map. In his private game he becomes complicit with the super-intelligent, all-powerful, casually murderous Martians; he allows some part of himself to go off on a rampage of vicarious massacre overseen by “intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic,” a company he might well have preferred to the scared scurrying earthlings of the suburbs who play for the most part such an inglorious role in his novel. All the same, another part of him contemplates the resulting carnage with horrified awe. A mood of trauma sets in, amplified in various registers by every person he happens to meet, like the “timorous, anemic” curate who complains: “Why are these things permitted?… What are these Martians?” There is no right response because what the Martians perceive is by definition beyond us. They are the devouring Other, superior, pitiless, and unknowable. Malevolence has nothing to do with it. All they can do for human beings, besides annihilating them, is to provide a momentary occasion to look at the human situation in a different light, to reconfigure existing definitions of what humans are. At the same time, the protagonist’s disordered wanderings take on a visionary flavor. The narrator turns the events over and over, finding upsetting metaphors for the events that have occurred and equally upsetting contradictions in the way he reacts to them, reliving random encounters and insights in the midst of chaos as if they were episodes in some future scripture: “It came to me that I was upon this dark common, helpless, unprotected, and alone. Suddenly, like a thing falling upon me from without, came fear.” Biblical echoes proliferate even as the hero lashes out, for instance, at the curate’s evocation of “the great and terrible day of the Lord”: “What good is religion if it collapses under calamity?… Did you think God had exempted Weybridge? He is not an insurance agent, man.” In its way the book belongs to a characteristic English mode of allegorical, more or less insular peregrination that can be discerned in works as disparate as The Pilgrim’s Progress, Defoe’s Journal of the Plague Year, John Clare’s hallucinatory account of his journey on foot out of Essex, and The Wind in the Willows. (Sebald’s The Rings of Saturn is a recent addition to that canon.) 
  Something very like the war-fever that occasionally runs through a civilized community had got into my blood…. I can best express my state of mind by saying that I wanted to be in at the death.
 
  Perhaps I am a man of exceptional moods…. At times I suffer from the strangest sense of detachment from myself and the world about me; I seem to watch it all from the outside, from somewhere inconceivably remote, out of time, out of space, out of the stress and tragedy of it all.
 —is a thin layer bounded on one side by the uncontrollable world of microbiology and cellular evolution, on the other by the infinite coldness of an outer space that might well spawn an advanced intellect divorced from empathy. It is an impersonal and uncontrollable Darwinian process that sets up the inhabitants of Woking and Weybridge to be the victims of a mechanized warfare waged by beings incapable of pity for them, and leads to a Victorian gentleman being reduced (as we do not quite see Tom Cruise reduced) to gnawing the bones of cats and rabbits for sustenance. 
  a persuasion that I was no longer a master, but an animal among the animals, under the Martian heel. With us it would be as with them, to lurk and watch, to run and hide; the fear and empire of man had passed away.
 He imagines himself a rabbit returning to his burrow, to find that men have dug it up to lay the foundations of a house. Such images proliferate like hiding places—comfortless hiding places—within the otherwise monotonous accounts of human civilization burned and laid waste. Wells’s novel remains a much tougher work than any of its offspring, and a richer one. Orson Welles and his scriptwriter Howard Koch took one aspect of the story—the breakdown of modern communications under the stress of the invasion—and translated it into a still exhilarating game in which radio’s means were turned against itself and drama culminated in dead air giving the answer to the question: “Isn’t anyone there?” George Pal’s 1953 film turned the book into an efficiently paranoid cold war entertainment, with tactical nukes failing to stop the invader, civil defense officials politely overseeing mass evacuations, and those left behind piling into churches as a last resort. With Spielberg, the trauma of anticipation that animated Wells gives way to something like a nostalgia for that trauma. Its legacy of perverse beauties—the by now antique images that he lovingly refurbishes—is after all so much more bearable than the actual disasters that have followed. It is as if, in the face of more pressing terrors, Spielberg sought the comfort of Martians. For all its faithfulness to the demands of blockbuster filmmaking—with all that implies of playing to emotion and steering away, as Wells never does, from the convolutions of thought—his movie is also just faithful enough to Wells to convey what cold comfort that can be."
"Aug 15, 2013",positive," “Is it the terrorists?” a frightened child asks, because that is the scariest thing she knows. But what makes this thing scary is that it is something no one knows. It is beyond our knowledge, even beyond our imagination. Earth is under attack and no one knows by whom or what they want. These are not the “let’s play musical notes together” aliens of Close Encounters of the Third Kind or the Reese’s Pieces-loving, bicycle-flying botanist alien from E.T.: The Extraterrestrial. There’s no “Take me to your leader,” or Klaatu Barada Niktu. These aliens don’t even want to keep humans on as slave labor as in Battlefield Earth. They don’t want us to understand or negotiate with them. It does not seem to be about power or plunder. They just want to destroy us. As one character says, “This is not a war any more than there’s a war between men and maggots. It’s an extermination.” Steven Spielberg knows two things better than anyone else who ever made a movie, and both are in top form here. First is his extraordinarily evocative sense of family life, the way every detail of home and connection (even, maybe especially the most frayed of connections) tell the story and make us care about it. A ribbon, a mirror, a boot, a box of family photographs, a Beach Boys song –- the juxtaposition of the ordinary with the unthinkable sustains a “golly” factor that grabs our throats and our hearts at the same time. The special effects in the movie are dazzling. Just when we thought that we were so accustomed to the limitless wonders of CGI that we could never be stunned in a theater again, Spielberg just plain knocks our socks off. My husband counted eight spontaneous “Oh my Gods” coming from me during the movie. It isn’t just that it all looks real, seamlessly integrating the effects. It’s that what looks so real is so “Oh my God.” The images are fresh and imaginative and yet perfectly believable, mixing the normal with the inconceivable, from the vast alien machines to the buckling of the earth and the apocalyptic landscapes. The most vivid images are when we see the trappings of everyday life transformed. In one moment of complete insanity, the bells at a railroad crossing start to clang, and the striped barriers come down as though it is a perfectly ordinary day and the commuter train is about to arrive on schedule. Everyone stops and takes a breath and then the train comes in, filled with flames. Spielberg’s other great trick is his mastery of scale, and again, that use of context brings the story literally home. At least half of the “Oh my Gods” were responses to wow-style reveals of new threats, new invasions. And Spielberg makes invasion into a theme, from the very beginning, when with stunning economy he sets the stage for all that is to come. Our hero-to-be, Ray (Tom Cruise) arrives home late. His ex-wife Mary Ann (Miranda Otto), pregnant by her new husband, is standing there with a hand on her hip. The new husband is handsome, a little sleek-looking in a black turtleneck, but clearly so nice you can’t even bring yourself to hate him, though Ray has clearly tried. Even though the ex-wife is late, she decides to carry their daughter’s suitcase into Ray’s house. Ray is very uncomfortable as she opens his all-but-empty refrigerator and peeks into his messy bedroom. He feels invaded. His children seem alien. And yet, in one of the most understated but meaningful moments in the movie, a shared joke between Ray and Mary Ann shows us a glimpse of Ray’s asperity and resolve. But all of that is under the surface. When we meet him, Ray has long been used to disappointing people. It is not clear which is worse, the sullen animosity of his son Robbie (Ray wears a Yankees baseball cap; Robbie pulls out one with a Red Sox logo) or the patient lack of expectations from his daughter, Rachel (Dakota Fanning). But when it becomes clear that something very, very bad is happening, Ray will do anything to keep his family safe. This will be his story more than it is the story of the battles. The movie is at heart, well, heart. And Cruise does heart well. He and Fanning anchor the film with outstanding performances of conviction and charisma. Rachel’s protection of her “space” and Ray’s efforts to care for her memory and spirit all echo the invasion theme. The story moves well from the large scale destruction of a city to a small-scale intrusion into a shattered basement retreat occupied by three people. Throughout, the focus is on Spielberg’s favorite subject, the family as fortress. The government barely exists, the army is dedicated and honorable but overmatched. And, as Ray points out, the humans are almost as dangerous as the aliens. Ray is not the only one who will do anything to keep his family alive and the ochlochratic chaos means that nowhere is safe. The story is affecting, the action scenes are thrilling, the issues are resonant. Yet it is not ultimately as satisfying as less skillful movies like Independence Day. It may be wiser and it may have more artistic validity, but summer explosion movies call out for a more complete resolution than the Wells book allows. A valid but subtle point is lost, not for lack of respectful presentation, but perhaps because ot it. Spoilers alert: Parents should know that this is an extremely tense and intense movie, with constant peril and violence. Many characters are killed. Many are neatly vaporized, but there are scenes with dead bodies, a brutal off-camera murder, a death by impalement, guns, grenades, lasers, and other weapons, and some grisly images. Characters use brief strong language. There are tense confrontations between family members. Some viewers will find the behavior of the humans more disturbing than that of the aliens. Someone once said that the aliens in movies tell us more about what we are thinking about than about any likely real-life extraterrestrials. The UFO movies of the cold war era were, under this analysis, a reflection of our fears about communism and the atomic bomb — with the 1956 version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers and The Day the Earth Stood Still as examples, contrasted with the more benign aliens of Spielberg’s other movies. What does this movie tell us about our current fears? Families who see this movie should talk about how the story has changed since it was originally written by H.G. Wells more than 100 years ago. How was that era’s interest in the relatively recent scientific discoveries reflected in the book and how has the current version used modern concerns to connect to a contemporary audience? What do you think about the balance of the story between the action and the personal drama as Ray’s character has to become more responsible and
find a way to communicate with his children. How did both parts of the story help each other? In a situation like this, who do you help? Who do you accept help from? Families who appreciate this film may enjoy listening to the legendary Orson Welles broadcast. This version of the book has the radio script as well. The text is also available online at Project Gutenberg. The new version has a small tribute to the George Pal movie. They will also enjoy Independence Day, one of the all-time best alien invasion movies, and they might get a kick out of Battlefield Earth, one of the worst, and Signs, one that has a bit of both. For the first time after reading many, many of your excellent reviews, I finally saw a movie for which my review is quite different than yours. I saw the movie today, then looked up your review for the first time, thinking you’d probably have given it a “D”. I was surprised to see how highly you rated it. Of course, art is in the eye of the beholder and all are entitled to their perspectives.
Pardon me for saying, but I felt that this was one of the worst movies I’ve seen. I think that Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning are capable of good acting, but I feel that the script for this movie was horrible. To me, the movie consisted mainly of “Aliens attack earth: worst case scenario” for 99 pct of the movie, then 1 pct of “dying alien seen in spacecraft” before end of movie. I felt there was little plot other than this, and found myself fast-forwarding through a lot of the mayhem – explosions, wreckage, vaporizing bodies. I honestly would recommend that people not rent this movie. I felt my time was wasted.
I’ve found Steven Spielberg to be a good director, but inconsistent. Some of his movies have been great while others such as A.I., I felt were big duds. There is something disconnected about both A.I. and W.O.T.W.: their storylines are weak and the characters in them are not as dynamic as characters in better-made films. In E.T. and Indiana Jones (1), the characters are well-developed and dynamic. By contrast, characters in both A.I. and W.O.T.W. seemed more unidimensional. Stanley Kubrick managed to take themes of people dealing with disaster and make the characters come to life to a greater degree than Spielberg makes them. As Brad Bird of Pixar is fond of saying, special effects can only take a movie so far: in the end, it is the story that is the most important. Thanks very much, Brian.  This is a movie I like less and less as I get further away from seeing it.  You make some very good points and I will re-think my rating."

"Jul 23, 2007",positive," Steven Spielberg, in the first hour or so of War of the Worlds, summons the apocalypse with all his genius for suspense and sadism. Yes, sadism. I’ve long felt that Spielberg has a lot of anger to work off — it’s come out in the oddest ways in some of his films — and here he gets to kill most of us off via tripod-riding aliens who squash millions of people as if they were less than ants. Knocking over buildings, flinging cars in the air, up-ending ferries, zapping screaming humans into ash, Spielberg is, make no mistake, having the time of his life. War of the Worlds differs from a callow destruct-a-thon like Independence Day in that the large-scale carnage, with catastrophe building on catastrophe, thrills as much as it hurts. This is really the first whack Spielberg has had at depicting mass destruction since 1941 over twenty-five years ago, and he shows all the summer-movie whippersnappers how it’s done. When the aliens emerge from the cracked asphalt of New Jersey and begin their brutal business, you can safely strap in for some of the most awe-inspiring work Spielberg has done in years. The rest of War of the Worlds, though, is hit or miss. The problems, for some, may begin with Tom Cruise as the film’s default hero — Ray Ferrier, a divorced dad who never grew up. Spielberg’s portfolio is full of men like Ray, and they were more believable when smaller-scale actors like Richard Dreyfuss were playing them. In Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Dreyfuss, playing an equally childlike father, gave off a schlumpy Everyman vibe, but with a manic gleam that kept you unsure what he was going to do. Certainly Spielberg wouldn’t find it in himself these days to give us a hero who leaves his wife and kids behind, as Dreyfuss did; and Tom Cruise is not the sort of actor who makes you nervous in that way, at least not in this kind of role. Cruise hurts the film because you don’t buy for a minute that a summer movie starring Tom Cruise will end with him or his two kids (Dakota Fanning and Justin Chatwin) anywhere near dead. A remake of War of the Worlds directed by Spielberg would have sold itself; it didn’t need star power, and if Spielberg had cast someone like Paul Giamatti — an actor who can play someone who might fail — the movie would be more successfully terrifying. As it is, we’re not sure why Ray, running with hundreds of others on the chaotic streets, doesn’t get zapped along with the dozens who get reduced to ash constantly on either side of him, other than the fact that he’s Tom Cruise. As written and played, Ray has nothing much going for him aside from bulldog determination. He has to protect his kids at all times and at all costs, thwarted by one crisis or another (sometimes it’s aliens, sometimes it’s panicked mobs of people), and you get the sense that he’s being punished for being an absentee father. Millions of humans perish by fire so that Ray the deadbeat dad can redeem himself through action — or action-movie action. Apparently it wouldn’t be a Spielberg film these days without a stretch of film that makes little sense and could be deleted with no harm done, and here we have Ray and his little daughter holing up in a basement with a grim-faced survivalist played by Tim Robbins. The climax of this plot thread serves no purpose other than to prove that Ray will do anything to keep his daughter alive, except that the proof is kept behind a closed door. For Robbins’ part, playing a gun-toting redneck, he gives the sort of crude performance — to paraphrase Pauline Kael — only a very dedicated liberal would give. His character is Bad News the second we lay eyes on him, because he’s rural and he’s armed. Spielberg and Robbins are both capable of more subtlety than this. Some viewers have been bothered by the film’s wealth of 9/11-inspired imagery — the missing-person posters, the flakes of ash that used to be flesh falling everywhere. Spielberg gets a pass there — 9/11 showed us all what real disaster looks like, and it would be disingenuous of the movie to go back to the relatively clean zap-zap of something like Independence Day or, for that matter, the original 1953 War of the Worlds. If the destruction is unavoidably exciting, the aftermath is by necessity sobering and chilling. A director can be of two minds about the carnage he wreaks — we saw it in the famous “Ride of the Valkyries” helicopter-attack sequence in Francis Coppola’s Apocalypse Now, equal parts invigorating and appalling. Spielberg, following H.G. Wells’ book, eschews the ID4 formula of “Aliens attack; we hit back.” The power of our military is shown to be haplessly meaningless against the well-shielded aliens; the aliens’ downfall, as relevant today as in Wells’ day, is simply the arrogance of dominion. Too confident in their ability to wipe out big foes, they don’t account for smaller ones. In the end, this War of the Worlds plays on American fears much the same way earlier versions of the story (including Orson Welles’ notorious 1938 radio hoax) did — in this case, terrorism, with a side order of unease about the way things are going in Iraq. (Talk about the arrogance of dominion; if anyone finds it implausible that aliens would invade a planet they know fatally little about, how about a country that starts a war on bullshit pretenses with an insufficient number of troops and threadbare equipment, hoping that the people will greet us as liberators? We have met the aliens, and they are us.) It’s fun to analyze summer entertainment this way, if not terribly satisfying; it doesn’t make the movie larger than it is. I still prefer Tim Burton’s flamboyantly goofy Mars Attacks, which had no agenda other than to blow stuff up for fun. Spielberg blows stuff up better than anyone — he proves himself the maestro of that by-now-degraded game. But he does it so well that it’s a hard act for even the maestro to follow."

"Oct 30, 2006",positive," One of the more solidly crafted science fiction films in a while, “War of the Worlds” is about as far from quintessential ‘nice’ Steven Spielberg as you can get – which is why that makes this one of his better mainstream entertainment vehicles since “Jurassic Park”. Taking the HG Wells original story and following it more closely than expected (from the tripod designs, to the all too rushed and almost anti-climactic deus ex machina ending), Spielberg creates an alien invasion movie that can be labelled the antithesis to the likes of “Independence Day” or the ilk. The reason? The personal perspective. Rather than showing off the bigger focus of said invasion and the ‘power players’ you’d see in the likes of these movies (world leaders, leading scientists, etc.) this stays purely locked on one disjointed family. After a quiet ten minute introduction which plays out like your average family drama – in this case a pissed off divorcee dad finds his kids a hassle whilst they simply resent him – the film kicks into gear. There’s two scenes involving conversations in two different basements that run for about five minutes each, other than that, this is essentially one non-stop action sequence that never lets up. Even those two quiet scenes are followed by two of the film’s best scenes, the first of which made me shudder from its impact – something I can’t recall doing in a movie in years. “War” is an example of what both true science fiction (not that Lucas swashbuckling fantasy kiddie stuff) and the B-movie genre can achieve. Koepp’s script has practically no plot short of some large broad strokes, character development is both minimal and predictable, various sequences do feel derivative and repetitive. Yet its enthralling and cleverly lays out its beats perfectly, almost never letting its pace drop and never falling into traps. There’s no attempts at humour, patriotic speeches, pontificating or politics. The dialogue practically never sounds too cheesy (aside from Tim Robbins, the one weak character in the film). Indeed I looked for it but the words ‘alien’ or ‘martian’ never appear, its simply ‘them’ or they come from ‘elsewhere’. As much as I enjoyed “Revenge of the Sith” and loved “Batman Begins” this Summer, both have some big flaws relating to their ambitious scripts which reached further than their writers could live up to – the result was some hokey dialogue or moments which didn’t feel right. Koepp’s script on the whole isn’t as well conceived or grand, but by keeping the focus tight and personal he avoids some of the pitfalls. There’s one or two creaky points such as the convenient newsvan scene which serves as exposition central (although its gotten over with quickly thank god) or the somewhat ridiculous second last ending, but Koepp for the most part keeps our knowledge of events limited to what our main trio know. The lack of character development won’t be seen as a good thing by some, even if the film uses that to its advantage by never having these characters break out into unrealistic monologues spilling out background information. Its a simple no frills cautionary tale that’s smartly told, no more or less. Make no mistake though, this is not a happy blockbuster – “War of the Worlds” is a bleak and desolate movie in a hardcore unrelenting way. In fact “Saving Private Ryan” (with the exception of its opening 20 minutes) is in many ways a ‘nicer’ Spielberg film than this. Its not an R-rated film but pushes damn close to that boundary and is more shocking than some with the stricter rating such as the last few minutes set within Robbins’ basement which involves both a brutal act and a hideous revelation about the somewhat mishandled ‘red weed’ element. Even quieter scenes ranging from Dakota’s shocking discovery whilst taking a piss to little moments of people caught in collateral damage cause chills. Performances are strong all across the board too. For the first time in ages Tom Cruise seemed to be playing someone other than Tom Cruise. Despite all the hype and somewhat ingratiating public appearances lately which haven’t exactly been beneficial to his public profile, seeing him in action on screen again you realise the guy is a solid actor. In a role that’s almost purely reactionary in tone and could be seen as somewhat hokey in other hands, Cruise brings a necessary gravitas. Kudos should go out to all the supporting cast too – Fanning finally seemed to be playing someone her age (albeit still too smart), Chatwin makes a rebellious teen character actually sympathetic, even Otto’s tiny screen time brings some of the film’s few smiles. Like I said the only bum note is Robbins. Not because of the actor mind you, but more the character. Whilst Spielberg’s film liberally borrows elements from plenty of other sci-fi great films, one wonders why he had to import the stereotypical gun nut style character with his incessant whinging – maybe to act as counterpoint to Cruise (if so he could’ve done a lot better). Up until that point in the film this had been a pure action movie, from then on it changes tone to become something darker and more suspense-oriented. Its also when the film changes from Cruise and company being merely reactive to somewhat proactive including a rather stupid bit involving cages and an alien orifice that’ll make me avoid getting close to female genitalia ever again. The end solution falls along the lines of Wells tale which seems almost anachronistic and all too much of a cop out that will leave modern crowds with a somewhat sinking feeling. The look of the film is superb. From the ILM effects which are far better and less cartoonish than they’ve been in a while, to the superb designs of the tripods – the only bum note are the aliens themselves which seem like an ID4/Carebear hybrid. The disintegration beams are beautifully handled, especially with their after effect which renders one scene in the film to look like something out of a Calvin Klein commercial. Spielberg also tries his hand at being Robert ‘trick shot’ Zemeckis with a single shot take revolving in and around a moving van. Not only is the shot good, its actually used for one of the film’s best ‘quieter’ moments involving Dakota working out her ‘personal space’. There’s various laughable continuity errors from the somewhat selective effects of the EMP to the way it seems the roads are magically clear for driving a car through but these are pure nitpicks at best and don’t retract from the film at all really. So what are the real flaws? By retaining such a simple premise the film does tread over itself – more than once our trio of family heroes escape death or injury quite conveniently. Scenes of mass panic and hysteria are done convincingly but are hardly new. I love the basement ‘roving eye’ sequence but it feels very “Abyss” water tentacle-ish, I enjoyed the disgusting display of human selfishness in the scene with people scrambling to get into the car – even though I saw the same scene in “Day of the Triffids” over a decade ago. Various shots and sequences borrow from the best of the genre and despite its well told edge, there’s an almost cold distancing effect the film generates though its hard to tell if that’s deliberate or not. At times it desperately tries to become something more by squeezing in bits of subtext about various issues ranging from parental to paranoia. Those moments feel forced into what is essentially a streamlined and pure entertainment vehicle. There’s been a surprising amount of above average mainstream films this season, which seem to just keep getting better. On a technical and visceral level though “Worlds” can fairly be called one of the best Summer films so far. It’s the Spielberg of old, simple but smart entertainment. It’ll be loved by his fans, but its far from perfect and the coldness and brutality (undermined in the worst possible way by the cheesily happy ending) will stop it from being remembered or re-watched in the same way his far superior crowd pleasing efforts like “Raiders” or “Jaws” are. Its a B movie, but if you can get over the few but fatal shortcomings it has – WHAT a B movie."

Given the clampdown on timely press screenings and its star's assorted diversionary tactics, you'd suspect 'War of the Worlds'had something to hide. Yet this update of HG Wells' 1898 novel of alien attack is vintage latter-day Spielberg, re-establishing the director as reigning architect of disaster porn, unleashing a frenzy of the visible to metronomic rhythms of set-up and money shot, set-up and money shot.Divorced bad dad Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) has his two kids for the weekend when a freak lightning storm hits his blue-collar New Jersey neighbourhood. Next, an apocalypse: the ground cracks and yawns open, the basso-groan of alien-built tripods begins a terrifying industrial symphony, and crackling beams vapourise the fleeing herds one by one, their suddenly body-less clothes borne into the air like kites. (The mass-panicked humans can pose as much a threat as their predators, as when a deranged zombie mob descends on the Ferriers' car.) Like its characters,'War'is always on the run: no time to explain the alien infrastructure or the crimson kudzu-like vines choking the landscape; when a burning train screams past, we pause to stare wordlessly at its smoking streak, then it's on to the next catastrophe. September 11 signifiers abound – in the thick film of white death-dust veiling Cruise after a narrow escape, and the Red Cross volunteer megaphoning 'We have more blood than we can use' – but any social context or family pathos (yes, Ray rises to the occasion, but so did the dread Giuliani) is thin and wobbly. Nevertheless, the film succeeds as pure sensation, an exacting distillation of fear.

"Jul 13, 2005",positive," The visual effects are impressive and the crew does a technically competent job. The heart and warmth we've come to expect from Spielberg is missing.  Didn't I already see this in 1996, and wasn't it called Independence Day? (I'm only half-joking.) Actually, this movie is better than the aforementioned schlockfest, but to my surprise, it wasn't all that much better. I haven't read the book by H.G. Wells, on which this movie and its previous incarnations were based, but after seeing this latest remake, I really want to read the book. I suspect I'll enjoy it more than I enjoyed this movie.   Before I really delve into the review, I want to lament the loss of the old Steven Spielberg, the one who gave us such classics as The Goonies, the Indiana Jones series and, of course, E.T. I remember watching A.I. a few years ago and expressing surprise at how bad it was. I still feel that way, but despite that, what really permeates throughout A.I. is a high dose of sentimentality, and yes, even some warmth at times. But since then, Spielberg movies have been almost entirely devoid of warmth. I thought Minority Report was a decent movie, but it had almost no warmth at all. Even Schindler's List had some warmth to it at times, but War of the Worlds is almost completely devoid of the heart and warmth we have come to expect from Spielberg's movies. (Vic wrote an article about Spielberg's changing directorial style here.) Of course, Spielberg is free to do as he chooses, but he would do well to remember why he became one of the most successful directors in Hollywood.   Tom Cruise plays Ray Ferrier, a dock worker in New York City. He's cocky and has a chip on his shoulder (sound familiar?). He's also divorced with two kids, and he's not much of a father to them. His son Robbie (played by Justin Chatwin) basically won't even speak to him, and his daughter Rachel (played by Dakota Fanning) is growing more estranged from him every day. Ray's ex-wife Mary Ann (played by Miranda Otto) has married a rich guy named Tim (played by David Alan Basche), which only adds to the stress a working-class guy like Ray must feel. Long story short, this family puts the ""fun"" in dysfunctional.   Not long after Mary Ann drops the kids off at Ray's house for a visit, strange things start happening. The sky becomes very overcast, and a fierce wind starts blowing towards a big hole in the sky. Shortly after that, a series of lightning knocks out pretty much anything electrical in the area (except a few choice objects of the filmmakers' choosing — bah!). Wanting to find out what happened, Ray heads down to where the lightning struck. As it turns out, all the lightning bolts hit the same location, causing a big crater in the road. The crowd gathering around the crater doesn't have to wait long to see some action, though, because a huge alien vessel with three legs (henceforth called a tripod) pops out of the ground. Despite their fear at the fact that several city blocks have already been destroyed, the crowd's mentality is still one of curiosity, at least until the tripod starts shooting a laser beam at everyone in sight, instantly cremating them (but not their clothes, oddly enough). Ray immediately high-tails it back home, just barely avoiding the laser beams on several occasions. He quickly has his kids pack whatever they can, and since Ray knows where a working vehicle can be found (of course), they head for Boston to find Mary Ann and Tim.   Of course, as you might guess, the trip to Boston doesn't go exactly as planned, and they end up losing the vehicle because when you have the only working vehicle in New York City, people tend to get a little envious. They end up trying other methods to reach their destination, primarily walking and the ferry, all of which put them in harm's way because it turns out that there are quite a few tripods in quite a few locations throughout Earth. The vast majority of the movie features Ray and his kids trying to avoid being killed by the aliens. There are a few scenes where they hide out, but most of the time they are running for their lives. There are so many questions throughout this movie. Will Ray and his kids survive? Will humanity be able to defeat the powerful aliens, and will it somehow involve Ray? Will the audience groan in disbelief at an ending that feels like it was pulled right out of thin air?   The technical aspects of this film are very well done. The special effects are great, and most of the actors did fine jobs. I didn't really like Dakota Fanning's portrayal of Rachel. It seemed like half the time she was wise beyond her years, while the other half she was screaming her head off. I'm certainly no expert on what a ten-year-old should act like, but somehow I thought it should be more consistent. It's not all Dakota Fanning's fault, primarily because many of her mannerisms were script-driven. Tom Cruise does an admirable job of acting; you can always tell he works hard, and I see that as a good thing. He also does a good job of integrating one-liners into his scenes without making them seem cheesy or out of place.   So is the movie worth seeing? That depends on what you're expecting. If you're expecting to walk out of the theater with a big grin on your face while shouting, ""That was AWESOME!"" this movie won't fit the bill. It's too dark, somewhat depressing and very bloody and violent. (The PG-13 rating is well-deserved, so please do the little ones a favor and leave them at home.) If you're after great special effects and a high adrenaline rush and you don't mind the fact that the storyline takes a back seat, by all means go and see it. To be honest, this movie is better than most of the dreck coming out of Hollywood these days. The only problem is, considering the high caliber of talent behind the camera (and in front of it), I was expecting quite a bit more.  Obi-Wan Kenobi is a character with many different abilities, both in Star Wars canon and in Legends. However, not all of these powers are canon. Dune 2's ending delivers an epic conclusion to this chapter of Paul Atreides' story, as the sequel also teases what is next for the sci-fi franchise."

"Jul 6, 2005",negative," In the wake of all Tom Cruise’s … let’s say, idiosyncratic antics to prove to the world that he’s just dippy about Katie Holmes and therefore simply cannot be gay, what is one to make of a couple early moments in his new opus, War of the Worlds? First, his boss asks him, “What’s your problem anyway?” To this Cruise responds, “I know a couple of women who could tell you.” Do you suppose their names are Mimi and Nicole? A few minutes later, the movie cuts to a TV screen with the recently “outed” cartoon character SpongeBob Squarepants on it, announcing, “I’ve got a secret.” It’s kind of hard to believe these things are coincidental, but why are they here? What do they mean? Is Mr. Spielberg having a bit of fun at his star’s expense?  I’m sure I don’t know, but in a lot of ways it’s more interesting to ponder than the bulk of this generally respectable, but far from inspired, latest version of the H.G. Wells novel.  No, it’s not a bad movie — well, at least up until the last few minutes, when it becomes not just a bad movie, but a laughably bad one — but it’s rarely more than an efficient one that’s not helped by being Spielbergized.  The decision to update Wells’ 1898 novel to the present day isn’t really the problem. The story successfully survived this change when Orson Welles did his famous radio version in 1938 and more or less successfully survived it when Byron Haskin turned into a movie in 1953. Spielberg, in fact, has said that he wants the film to have the same impact as the radio show, and pays slight homage to the earlier movie by affording cameos for its stars, Gene Barry and Ann Robinson, in his new version.  Just how he planned to duplicate the impact of the Welles version is open to question, since the public reaction to Welles’ legendary “Panic Broadcast” is difficult enough to fathom, stemming from listeners who tuned in late or were simply so credulous they mistook the dramatization for an actual news broadcast of a Martian invasion. Presumably, he thought that the pre-war jitters of 1938 that might have fueled the original reaction would find their modern counterpart in fears of terrorist attacks. The film certainly goes out of its way to incorporate references to terrorists, but since this follows Morgan Freeman (inheriting the profound mantle of narrator from Sir Cedric Hardwicke in the 1953 film) on the soundtrack assuring us that the bad guys are from another planet, the idea only works as a conscious reference to the present day.  In any case, what hurts the film is Spielberg’s dogged insistence on turning it into yet another of his seemingly endless middle-brow meditations on the travails of the middle-class family. Casting aging uber-yuppie Tom Cruise as stevedore Ray Ferrier is pretty far-fetched to begin with, but the movie comes complete with a separate problem. Centering its story on negligent father Ray and his rebellious (22 year old) “teenage” son, Robbie (Justin Chatwin, Taking Lives), and precocious daughter, Rachel (precocious Dakota Fanning), may achieve the desired effect of communicating the terror felt by characters who barely understand what’s going on, but it removes any scientific underpinnings and creates a huge “Huh?” factor for the viewer not familiar with the novel.  Is it easier to identify with a rather unlikable stevedore and his appalling children than with the traditional pipe-smoking scientist? Possibly. Still, it might have been helpful if there’d been somebody around to explain the red vegetation that creeps over the landscape or postulate a bit about how any of the invaders’ various devices work.  Even setting this aside, the whole family-drama aspect of the film is not only Spielberg 101 at its simplest, it’s remarkably beside the point and distracting. Since almost no one else — other than Tim Robbins as a kind of survivalist loon — is given any kind of a character, the mass destruction is so impersonal that it’s more spectacle than grim tragedy. Moreover, the three characters we do get are just not very likable. Ray’s supposed growth from negligent papa to doting dad — with time out for a few minutes of action-hero stuff — isn’t terrifically believable or involving. Robbie is so truculent and pig-headed that he’s impossible to like, and Rachel quickly goes from Fanning’s standard pint-sized Bette Davis precocity to terrified 10-year-old screaming every five minutes is just annoying.  None of this is terribly surprising coming from Spielberg, but it is a surprise finding Spielberg shamelessly copying not only himself, but others here. It starts out early with scenes glimpsed as reflections in a TV set (Signs) and is soon extended to the tripod war machines sporting a design that borrows from the shape of the monster’s head in Alien and the war machines incomprehensibly possessing an apparent organic sphincter-like opening that’s straight out of Evolution (of all things!). A sequence where human beings are captured and stowed away in cages on the underside of the war machines looks and feel like a holdover from A.I..  There’s just something more than a little tired about all this, but the worst of the film is the preposterous ending. No, I’m not in reference to the plot device that’s right out of Wells’ novel, but the whole family resolution, which is worse than merely absurd. It gives off the distinct sense that it’s OK to destroy 99 percent of the world so long as it heals Ray’s fractured family.  All this to one side — and it’s a lot — there are undeniable moments of raw power in the film. The war machines are impressive enough and executed with some of the most convincing CGI jiggery-pokery yet to hit the screen. The scenes of destruction are certainly impressive, and they’re occasionally creepy — especially the river of corpses.  And, blessedly, Spielberg keeps the film under two hours.  The question is whether these are sufficient reasons to see the film, and I’m not sure they are. Yes, the movie is an adequate realization of its source novel and it generates a certain tension, but it’s also far from being the masterpiece it’s supposed to be. For folks who enjoy expertly crafted scenes of mass destruction, it’s a must-see. For anyone else, it’s apt to fall short.

"Jul 5, 2005",positive," Spielberg’s adaptation of H.G. Wells’ classic sci-fi novel is, in its own way, a model of the form, and a worthy successor to both Orson Welles’ panic-inducing 1939 radio broadcast and George Pal and Byron Haskin’s beloved 1953 Technicolor eye-candy version. Cruise plays Ray Ferrier, a divorced, New York City metalworker who finds himself saddled one weekend with not only his two kids, Robbie (Chatwin) and Rachel (Fanning), but also with the imminent destruction of mankind via alien invasion. For poor Ray, it’s going to be one of those weekends. Cruise is playing against type, dialing down that cocksure megawatt grin in favor of making Ray, as the film begins, an unsympathetic jerk more interested in rebuilding car engines (there’s one hogging space in his kitchen) than spending quality time with his offspring. When a freak lightning storm knocks out the power and opens up a crater in the middle of Main Street, Ray witnesses the arrival of an alien machine – the tripod – birthing its way up from beneath his very feet. From here on out, War of the Worlds is one lengthy but always gripping chase film as the massive alien tripods stalk hapless humans over hill and dale, blasting them into ash with vicious, serpentine ease while the military runs afoul of their seemingly invincible shields. It’s Spielberg’s best and truest action film since Jaws, relentlessly paced, pitch-perfectly acted (the young Fanning is almost certain to get a Best Supporting Actress nod come Oscar time), and rife with moments of such horrifically poetic imagery that it’s all you can do not to stop thinking about them long after the film has ended. Spielberg and the gang at Industrial Light & Magic have knocked the ball not only out of the park but out of Earth's orbit as well. The first appearance of the alien tripods is as breathtakingly awesome – in the truest sense of the word, mind you – as anything yet put on film, and that’s only in the film’s first 20 minutes. As Ray and his kids commandeer the only working vehicle in town and light out for Boston with the aim of finding the kids’ mother, they run up against wave after wave of human refugees, panicked and herded by the towering alien craft like so much cattle to the slaughter. And slaughter it is: There’s precious little outright gore in this hard PG-13 film, but one of the film’s most nightmarishly lyrical moments recalls both the awful first seconds after the impact(s) on the World Trade Center towers without so much as a drop of the red stuff. The metaphor for terrorist attack is so front and center it hardly bears mentioning; War of the Worlds is pure popcorn escapism of the highest order if you want it to be, or more, but it’s never less than thrilling, thanks in enormous part to the film’s magnificent, sternum-rattling sound design, surely another of the film’s Oscar-calibrated achievements. Faithful to Wells’ novel in ways the 1953 version was not, the film’s script, by David Koepp and Josh Friedman, sports more than a few plot holes (for one, the electricity outage seems might selective), and an ending (faithful to Wells’ original, it should be noted) that feels just a tad too abrupt. But that’s no reason to ignore what is certainly one of the most lovingly crafted, end-of-the-world, cinematic feasts ever made, a spectacle of destruction and survival not even C.B DeMille could have envisioned.

"Jul 5, 2005",positive," In a seemingly benign, yet ultimately ominous line of dialogue early in Steven Spielberg’s War of the Worlds, the ex-wife of Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise), a New Jersey dock worker and charmingly deadbeat dad, says to him after dropping off their two kids for the weekend, “Take care of our children.” At the time she says it, she has no idea that the world as they know it is on the brink of utter destruction and that her admonition to Ray will soon take on a dimension previously unimaginable. It’s a perfect moment of irony, reminding us that the worst always happens when we least expect it. The worst in this case is an alien invasion, one that has been planned for millions of years because the enormous tripod alien machines used to eviscerate anything and everything in their paths don’t come from the skies, but rather emerge from deep beneath the ground where they were buried long ago. The alien craft have a retro quality in that they conform to the descriptions and illustrations of H.G. Wells’ Victorian-era source novel, but rather than detracting from the movie’s modern setting, this retro-ness adds to their displaced uncanniness. The spindly legs on which they stand give them a snaky, insect-like quality that makes them more monstrous than mechanical. In War of the Worlds, Spielberg has crafted a genuinely traumatic summer event movie, one that gives us images of violence and destruction of often devastating emotional weight. Not since A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001) has he used a movie to cut so close to the bone, and while War of the Worlds lacks that movie’s emotional-thematic resonance, it is nonetheless the most gripping and accomplished work he’s done in years. As a rebuke to his previous alien movies, Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) and E.T. (1982), War of the Worlds is at times shocking, yet it fits well with Spielberg’s increasingly dark cinematic worldview, which has been slowly saturating his output ever since he made Schindler’s List in 1993. In a way, it’s like he’s never been able to shake the Holocaust, and despite his constant attempts to tack on upbeat endings, his films from the past 10 years have been increasingly preoccupied with loss, trauma, and suffering in ways that even the sunniest of endings can’t recuperate. Trauma is the operative word in War of the Worlds, which bears the distinct stamp of 9/11 in virtually every respect. It is not so much that catastrophic destruction on the big screen immediately brings to mind the televisual images of the Twin Towers coming down, but that Spielberg actively engages in associating the events in his sci-fi spectacle with the traumatic memories from four years earlier. The shattered, flaming remains of a downed airplane, with bodies still strapped into the seats, teary-eyed family members posting signs with the pictures of missing loved ones, and a major character covered in the chalky gray dust of eviscerated bodies are just a few of the movie’s most strikingly associative images, and when people scream in the movie, it doesn’t have the canned cadence of hundreds of extras responding to instructions through a bull-horn, but rather a real sense of panicked terror. The idea of the tripods being buried in the ground—essentially planted in our midst, awaiting the right moment to strike—evokes the ever-present fears, stoked by post-9/11 stories about the hijackers, of terrorists moving among us. We fear invasion, but more than anything we fear invasion from within our own midsts.  Of course, this shouldn’t come as too much of a surprise. In each of its major incarnations, War of the Worlds has born the weight of the times. It was originally written as a serialized novel in 1898 by the pessimistic sci-fi master H.G. Wells, whose fears of modernization gave the story of Martian invaders a prescient kick. When it was brought to life as a famously panic-inducing radio show by Orson Welles’s Mercury Theater in 1938, it was cast in the eerie light of a world on the brink of war. And when it was made into a groundbreaking event movie by George Pal in 1953, it became a perfect example of Cold War paranoia and fears about a Red invasion. All of those versions of the story took a wide view of the events, so one of the main differences in the new movie is that screenwriters Josh Friedman and David Koepp restrict our view of what’s happening to the realm of three people: Ray Ferrier and his two children, his angry 15-year-old son, Robbie (Justin Chatwin), and his precocious 10-year-old daughter, Rachel (Dakota Fanning). This eliminates many of the clichés associated with alien-invasion stories and other movies that rely on the spectacle of mass destruction, particularly the images of major monuments being destroyed. Instead, much of the large-scale violence is seen only in fragmented form, often through a partially obscured window or reflected in a rearview mirror. Spielberg doesn’t scrimp on the special effects—deep inside, he knows they’re the film’s bread and butter—but he recasts the FX-heavy destruction from an individual point of view, which is what gives it emotional weight. He is also deeply cognizant of aftermath, and many of the movie’s most striking, borderline horrific images are not of the carnage in action, but the eerily quiet moments after, such as a river choked with corpses and a nightmarish walk through a forest at night while empty clothing rains down from above. Spielberg has always been hailed (or criticized) as a filmmaker deeply in touch with our collective inner child, and it is possibly for this reason that he is also so good at tapping into the kinds of childlike fears that we never really grow out of, but simply learn to cope with. Throughout Spielberg’s films, children have often borne the brunt of violence (think of the Indian child slaves in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom or Carol Anne being abducted by ghosts in Poltergeist), and it is no different here. Dakota Fanning’s Rachel gets the worst of it throughout War of the Worlds simply because she is a child. She doesn’t necessarily go through anything worse than the other characters, but her youth makes her experience that much worse. It is telling that Ray spends as much of the movie trying to protect her psychologically as he does physically, at one point covering her eyes with a blindfold—not to protect her from witnessing alien-inflicted violence, but rather some of his own. While most of the carnage in War of the Worlds is the work of the invaders, Spielberg doesn’t turn a blind eye to how such catastrophe brings out both the best and the worst in people. In terms of the former, the movie is clearly intent on redeeming Ray as a father figure, showing that, despite his lousiness as a dad in everyday life, his paternal instinct to protect his children maintains a natural sharpness. It is interesting, in this respect, to see Cruise playing the character, since he has so often played ambitious young men acting out against their missing father figures.  Ray’s hard-scrabble heroism (it is never, in any sense, superhuman) constantly runs up against the actions of other people who are behaving just as he is—in the interest of self-preservation—but with a sometimes crueler (read: more desperate) edge. The movie’s most disturbing sequence doesn’t involve aliens at all, but rather a mob of people who tear Ray and his family from the minivan in which they’re driving (one of the only working cars around). As Ray and his children stumble into a nearby diner, we see through the window behind them strangers shooting each other to get control of the van, which is the breaking point for Ray, causing him to openly weep in front of those for whom he is trying to be strong. All of this suggests that War of the Worlds is not your typical summer event movie. If anyone other than Spielberg had directed it and if anyone other than Cruise were starring in the lead role, studio executives would have surely demanded that it be given a lighter tone with more emphasis on heroism and salvation than death and destruction. One wonders if the film’s final scenes, which attempt to offer a suggestion of hope and even go so far as to almost literally resurrect a character from death, weren’t the product of a committee meeting to dampen the film’s otherwise bleak vision of annihilation. Perhaps so, but it is hardly enough to dispel, much less completely remove, the aftertaste of Spielberg’s imagery, which despite its fantastical origins, is some of the most powerful of his career.

"Jul 5, 2005",positive," A friend of mine has a young baby who could affectionately be classed as a screamer. Thus far, the only foolproof method of placating her is to turn on the soothing tones of the narrator from Jeff Wayne’s War of the Worlds. I’ll be advising him at the earliest opportunity that if he ever wants the child to sleep again, he should on no account consider Steven Spielberg’s War of the Worlds as a future companion piece for her. Because this is truly the stuff of nightmares, a primal horror of such ferocity that not even Richard Burton will be able to calm you down after it.  
Freely adapted from the novel by H.G. Wells, for the first fifteen or so minutes it’s a domestic drama, as blue collar worker Ray Ferrier (Cruise) struggles with the task of looking after his two children (Fanning and Chatwin) for the weekend while his ex-wife (Otto) goes to Boston with her new husband. Ray is not a good father, as evidenced by his empty fridge and dubious methods of interacting with his kids. Fortunately for him, the end of the world intervenes and saves him from what could have been a really tough couple of days.  
News reports have been telling of freak electrical storms around the globe, and when the lightning hits the Ferrier’s neighbourhood, what begins as a cool light show quickly turns into something infinitely more dangerous. As the streets crack apart and buildings crumble, the source of all this devastation reveal themselves from deep beneath the ground – giant mechanical tripods that begin disintegrating everyone and everything in sight. Barely managing to get out of town alive, Ray and his family flee cross country, desperately trying to evade their attackers’ constant onslaught while clinging to the slim hope of safety.  
No one would have believed in the first years of the 21st century that two of cinema’s foremost exponents of summer entertainment would have come together again and fashioned something as unrelentingly grim as War of the Worlds. Merciless in its intensity, uncompromising in its brutality, this film will rock you to your core. This is not invasion, it’s apocalypse. The first scenes of alien rampage set the tone, as thousands of people are mown down without regard or pity, and the film continues in the same vein throughout, alternating scenes of massacre with blind hysteria and moments of quiet reflection and sorrow.  
Spielberg throws in many a nod to his own back catalogue – the ‘raptor kitchen hunt from Jurassic Park is recreated as an unbearably tense game of alien hide and seek that embarrasses Shyamalan’s risible Signs. The handheld confusion and immediacy of Saving Private Ryan is recalled in the scenes of destruction that bring a new realism to CGI. Not that the special effects are the ultimate barometer of the quality of War of the Worlds but, as it happens, they’re simply astonishing. And yet Spielberg doesn’t draw attention to them, often preferring to use an eye popping event in the background to accentuate the human misery being played out in front of it.  
The focus of this remains squarely on the Ferriers, with little or no indication given to events throughout the world. This puts a lot of pressure on the cast and they step up admirably. Tom Cruise remains an inexplicably underrated actor, and his work here is amongst his best ever. From his early scenes as a deadbeat weekend father, through his transformation into a reluctant hero, whether struggling to hold his emotions in check for the sake of the kids, or giving his all to protect them, he completely convinces. And what else is there to be said about the frighteningly talented moppet that is Dakota Fanning? In the last year alone she’s more than held her own against big Denzel and now wee Tom, not to mention carving a few slices off the honey roasted rump of De Niro.  
War of the Worlds is a terrifying potential vision of our own self inflicted doomsday, masquerading as a summer blockbuster. And if, after an hour and three quarters of total carnage, the resolution seems a little on the easy side, I’m afraid there’s no one to blame for that but Mr. Wells."

Lightning storms herald the arrival of alien monsters in Spielberg's refreshingly dark and brutal remix of H G Wells' sci-fi classic The War Of The Worlds. There is no Independence Day bombast here; everything is told through the eyes of Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise), an ordinary man whose only concern is the safety of his children (Dakota Fanning and Justin Chatwin). As the world around them is engulfed in flames, survival may be the best they can hope for. 
There are three Steven Spielbergs. First up is warm, fuzzy Stevie, who makes life-affirming slush like The Terminal. Then there's Serious Steven, who makes worthy films about Important Issues. And finally, you have psycho Steve, who just wants to creep up behind you and yell ""Boo!"" Psycho Steve is the guy who made Jaws, Jurassic Park, the best bits of Minority Report, and (yes!)  War Of The Worlds. The story may be sci-fi, but the product is a horror film, plain and simple: a brilliantly constructed scaring machine. 
Cruise is on fiery form, exploiting the sharky side of his personality to expose Ray's frailties, and he's well matched by Fanning's panicking child, in a performance so genuinely traumatised that it's uncomfortable to watch. The only bum note is sounded by Tim Robbins, hamming it up dreadfully as a Schnapps-pickled survivalist. 
Beginning as an alien reworking of Saving Private Ryan and quickly evolving into a feast of stunning imagery ripped straight from a nightmare, WOTW astounds, alarms and grips you like a bear-trap. Psycho Steve is back. Hold on to your popcorn."

"Jul 5, 2005",positive," Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) is a working class slob, estranged from his family and too wrapped up in himself. His self-involvement will soon take a back seat when alien beings invade the Earth and threaten to annihilate mankind in Steven Spielberg’s making of the H.G. Wells classic tale, “War of the Worlds.” 'She's my little deuce coupe, You don't know what I got' 'Little Deuce Coupe,' The Beach Boys Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) is taking care of his wary kids Robbie (Justin Chatwin, ""Taking Lives"") and Rachel (Dakota Fanning, ""Hide & Seek"") in his home beneath Newark's Casciano Bridge while his ex-wife (Miranda Otto, ""The Lord of the Rings"") and her new husband visit her parents in Boston. Rachel becomes increasingly terrified of what at first appears to be a particularly violent electrical storm, but when Ray sets out to investigate, he is shocked to find himself in the midst of a ""War of the Worlds."" Switching the focus from Gene Barry's scientist of the 1953 edition to a single guy taking a crash course in familial love and responsibility, Steven Spielberg creates a visceral thrill ride for the first two-thirds of his film before losing steam and wrapping with an ending as ludicrously implausible as last year's airheaded ""The Day After Tomorrow."" Spielberg fans will recognize recycling from several of his earlier movies, but they all serve their purpose in this loving amalgamation of today's technology with retro images from the director's childhood. Ray's a cocky blue collar guy who works on the docks and stocks his kitchen with car parts. His rocky role as a dad is underscored immediately and often when he shows up a half hour late to meet his ex at his house. His teenaged son can barely be bothered to greet him and Ray's attempt to toss the ball around out back turns into a hostile contest. After sleeping off his third shift, Ray awakens to discover that Robbie, who does not yet have his license, has taken off in Ray's car. Meanwhile ignored television news reports of strange blackouts and earthquakes in other parts of the world play out in the background (shades of Shyamalan's ""Signs""). After that horrific lightning display (mostly suggested via a terrific use of sound) Robbie returns to tell dad he watched the same spot get hit countless times. Ray proceeds to the intersection of Van Buren where he witnesses the first 'tripod,' an unearthly machine a hundred feet tall, rise up beneath the street to begin moving on three spindly legs, vaporizing everything in its path. Ray returns home like a 9/11 witness covered in ashes and hijacks the only vehicle not disabled by EMP to get his kids back to their mom. Screenwriters Josh Friedman and David Koepp (""Secret Window"") keep the basics from the H.G. Wells novel (narrator Morgan Freeman opens and closes with passages from the book), but their introduction of the aliens is a major hiccup, the implication being that aliens planted thousands of tripods a million years earlier. Why the wait many are sure to ask - one can deduce that a buildup in the human population was necessary, but it is difficult to imagine that none of these underground machines would have been discovered in the interim. They smartly twist a second onslaught, heard but not seen in a home's basement, into a human disaster, yet Spielberg presents the aftermath too pristinely, with no sign of bodies where there should be (he later has no such qualms when Rachel witnesses the Hudson River chockablock with the dead, a very grim and effective loss of innocence). The invasion, though, is really a backdrop to the Ferrier story. Forced by extreme circumstances, Ray finds himself making most of the right choices and, over the course of the film, earns his kids' trust after being clearly dismissed at the onset. In one of the numerous references to 9/11, Robbie is jazzed by the sight of the military, wanting to 'fight back,' but Rachel demands to know who will take care of her if he should leave. Ray is amazed by his eldest's instincts when Robbie assists strangers during a disastrous ferry crossing, then faces his own kind of ""Sophie's Choice"" moment when Robbie begs to leave while Rachel is being pulled away by misguided strangers. After letting one child go, Ray goes to lengths he probably never dreamed of to protect his daughter and finds a fierce source of love in the bargain. Cruise takes his signature cockiness and, this time around, makes it a false front for a not-so-likable-guy (he watches his very pregnant wife haul suitcases up his stairs) who still exhibits shreds of decency ('That look suits you,' is the last thing he says to his obviously delighted ex). He projects fear-based adrenaline to accomplish what he must, and a softening sensitivity towards Rachel ('Little Deuce Coupe' is sung in lieu of the lullabies he neglected to learn). Dakota Fanning is mostly required to register either shock or fear and she accomplishes both believably just as Chatwin is a credibly distant teen. In the only other role of real significance, Tim Robbins (""Mystic River"") is saddled with the ill-defined Ogilvy, who exists only as a test of Ray's character. The aliens and their tripods have a look reminiscent of old cover illustrations of Well's novel (production design by Rick Carter (""Jurassic Park,"" ""Artificial Intelligence: AI"") combined with ferocious sound effects (sound design and effects editing by Michael Babcock ""Starsky & Hutch"") that render them forbiddingly modern. Country encounters with the tripods have a retro 'set' feel where hills lead up to a skyline hiding the monsters beyond (think ""Invaders from Mars""). Spielberg stages a terrific water tank sequence, where a tripod rises to upset a crowded ferry. The Ferriers watch from the water as a car slides off the deck right at them, plunging them underwater (cinematography by Janusz Kaminski ""The Terminal""), but many other sequences are redressed from earlier films, most prominently ""Jurassic Park's"" raptor kitchen scene, which is now an evasion of a tripod's 'eye.' The eyes which haunted Cruise in ""Minority Report"" return here, not only on the tripods but in a duplicated shot through the hole of a broken windshield and Ray's constant 'blinding' of Rachel. That vibrating RR sign from ""Close Encounters"" is an earlier, simpler manifestation of electromagnetic pulse and ""AI's"" Flesh Fair is echoed in the human cages of the tripods' undercarriage. The director goes too far pushing 9/11 images, though. We get the point early on as debris floats through the sky, but a wall of the missings' photos at a ferry landing makes little sense given the continuing chaos. ""War of the Worlds"" is a near perfect thrill ride, but its creator throttles any suspension of disbelief right out of us with an all too perfect, utterly nonsensical happy ending. Yet while his ""War's"" waging, Spielberg will have you by the throat. Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) is a working class slob, estranged from his family and too wrapped up in himself to have little more than a passing interest in son, Robbie (Justin Chatwin), and daughter, Rachel (Dakota Fanning). But, his self-involvement will soon take a back seat when alien beings invade the Earth and threaten to annihilate mankind in Steven Spielberg’s making of the H.G. Wells classic tale, War of the Worlds.” Spielberg is a master craftsman in the art of film spectacle making and his vision of the H.G. Wells story has all the visual elements one expects in a big-budget sci-fi actioner. Unfortunately, the decision was made, somewhere along the line, to draft sophomore scripter Josh Friedman (“Chain Reaction”) to adapt the terrific Wells story. The new telling starts off well enough to spark the viewer’s interest with the mysterious, violent storms and meteors crashing into the earth as everyman Ray tries to save his kids. But, mediocre writing, especially the finale, and shallow characters puts the “WotW” into the category of routine. As Ray frantically tries to save his kids, the story meanders from one terrific action sequence to the next but the characters are not fully drawn. Cruise tries to delve into the anger, fear and frustration of a man helpless to stop the relentless monsters out to kill him and his kids. What we get is a man who seems to be more ticked off that his bowling night was cancelled than a man trying to survive. There is little to laud about with the supporting cast of mostly unknowns. Besides Cruise, only Dakota Fanning and Tim Robbins have noticeable star power but neither gives (or is allowed to give) fully developed performances. Fanning, a favorite of mine, is left to look scared and scream at the appropriate moments, but the director handles even this unevenly. Things, story-wise, start to peter out at about the two-thirds mark, just in time to introduce Ogilvy (Robbins), a survivalist with a hankering to bring the war, guerrilla-style, to the aliens. This extended scene takes elements from the 1953 version (a first-rate Cold War allegory) starring Gene Barry and duplicates them almost exactly – with the benefit of over 50 years of F/X development – but it bogs the whole movie down until the insipid, happily ever after ending. The special F/X extravaganza is worth the price of admission from start to finish as the space invaders rear their armored heads and begin blasting mankind into oblivion. There are a number of visual set pieces – the overhead highway being methodically blown to bits next to Ray’s working class neighborhood; an auto ferry that is too close when an alien death machine rises out of the Hudson River; the hopeless battle between the brave US Army and the undefeatable robot monsters – that are eye candy of the finest kind. One thing that real bothers me, though, with the new War of the Worlds” is the need to play foot loose and fancy free with science. Much is done to establish the power of the aliens when they unleash the cataclysmic electro-magnetic pulse blasts that render everything electrical into uselessness. Then, with thousands, even millions, of vehicles disabled by the EMP, Ray steals a car that just so happens to have a new starter solenoid. It doesn’t seem to matter that any of the electrics in the car would be fried. Then, later on, the little family comes upon a town with fully functioning electricity but not one of the vehicles works. This kind of cavalier treatment is unnecessary at this level of entertainment and impacted my suspension of disbelief. I’m wondering if all the hype that has followed this film (and Mr. Cruise’s much publicized romance with half-his-age Katie Holme) set expectations higher than they should have been. Having read the original H.G. Wells story, which has been a favorite of mine for many years may, also raised my hopes higher than they probably should have been.” WotW” is a beautifully crafted film with the F/X money up there on the screen but suffers from a story that spirals down to its weak finale. The sappy and silly happily-ever-after ending deserves a big “BOO!”"
