"Apr 4, 2024",positive,"So convincing was this clever, chilling fake documentary that Donahue’s mother received sympathy cards from people who believed that her daughter was actually dead or missing. "
"Jun 5, 2023",positive," I distinctly remember driving home in the dark, along a desolate country road (my family lived in the boonies), feeling a mild dread at my wooded surroundings. It was July 1999, and my buddy and I had just seen The Blair Witch Project at the local multiplex. I had seen horror movies in the theater before, but never anything that seemed so real. I knew it was a work of fiction — the marketing hadn’t pulled the wool over my eyes — but this was the first found footage film I had ever seen and it actually rendered me somewhat nervous as my friend pulled into my rural driveway that night and I got out of the car. I wasn’t the only one impressed by The Blair Witch Project. The film was a massive success, going on to be one of the most profitable films of all time, with a worldwide box office of $248.6 million set against a budget of just $60,000 (that’s insane.) But was it a fluke? I don’t think so. I’d argue that The Blair Witch Project remains an effective horror film, with its first-person, camcorder style and slow-burn, don’t-show-shit delivery (seriously, I’m still waiting to see that witch) giving it a rawness and realness that made what might have been a rote horror flick into something memorable. Not only that, but the movie spawned an entire sub-genre of horror — found footage — and blazed a trail for viral internet marketing. It might have spawned a couple crappy sequels, but it’s a highly influential horror film and one worth watching 20 years later. Think about the horror landscape of the late 1990s. Horror had actually been made hip again by  Scream  just a few years earlier, and most big-name films coming out were clones — e.g.  I Know What You Did Last Summer, Urban Legend. The Blair Witch Project was almost the antithesis of these movies. A low-budget indie flick starring plain-looking folks, set in the woods in rural Maryland. No blood, no T&A? ? Yawn city, right? But the film got wide distribution and its first-of-its-kind nature made it stand out from the glossy herd. Some of it might have been due to the marketing (more about that in a bit), but put simply, The Blair Witch Project  is a scary, too-real experience. And it certainly helped that no one had ever seen anything like it before. It’s a fairly simple story. A trio of student filmmakers go to Burkittsville, Maryland to investigate the famous Blair Witch. They go into the woods, find weird rocks outside their tents, and even weirder stick figure people hanging from the trees. Then one guy, Josh, goes missing, there’s lots of screaming, and finally the remaining two, Heather and Mike, are taken out by an unseen force in some random creepy house in the woods. Scary but nothing groundbreaking story-wise. But the first-person, found-footage format gives all of this action a realness that slick cinematography and “spooky” mood lighting never could. You’re watching “real” people on a real, somewhat uneventful hike through the woods, and you’re practically out there with them. It helps that most of the dialogue was improvised. The actors were sent into the woods for eight days, directed where to go and what scenes to act each day by a series of messages left in film cans throughout Seneca Creek State Park. There might not be any snappy dialogue or incredibly staged shots in The Blair Witch Project, but there’s an authenticity to the experience that makes things really scary when shit starts to hit the fan. The scare-factor gets a big boost thanks to the film’s restraint. Maybe it was a budgetary thing (could they even afford to make an effective-looking witch with their pittance of a budget?) or maybe filmmakers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez were students of the Jaws and Alien school of horror filmmaking, but it certainly helped that they didn’t show the witch or gore or really any of the scary visuals one would expect from a horror movie. Think about it: you never see a dead body, no witch, in the movie. The most “graphic” thing shown is a pile of sticks containing what is believed to be Josh’s bloody shirt, teeth and hair; it’s onscreen for a split second and it’s no more scary than something you’d pick up at a Spirit Halloween shop. But all of this holding back allows the viewer to ruminate, to build up horrifying images in their own heads. Some might call that cheap or lazy, but it’s effective as hell, and it worked. Once Hollywood saw how successful The Blair Witch Project was, it was only a matter of time before others followed in Myrick and Sánchez’s footsteps. Not only was found footage a unique new way to tell stories, but it was hip and capital C cheap. Would the Paranormal Activity style=”font-weight: 400;”> franchise or Cloverfield exist had The Blair Witch Project not shown that found footage could work? The genre really took off in the early 2010s, with a new one practically coming of every other day, it seemed — The Last Exorcism, V/H/S, Unfriended.  Some found footage films are memorable, some are abysmal. What’s been made abundantly clear is that making a “found footage” production isn’t enough to carry a mediocre film. The Blair Witch Project works because it slowly builds dread and features realistic characters that one can empathize with. It also helped that it was a novel idea, a truly original concept, in 1999. In 2019, a director has to work extra hard to make an effective found footage movie not seem like a gimmick. It’s not surprising that Blair Witch, the second sequel to The Blair Witch Project, has a 37 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Slicker is definitely not better when it comes to these type of films. It’s all about creating an authentic experience.  Myrick and Sánchez came up with the concept for The Blair Witch Project after realizing that paranormal documentaries, of which they were fans, were often scarier than traditional horror movies based on the same mythology. When they began marketing The Blair Witch Project, they went all-in on the documentary angle, pitching it as actual footage, the final days of a trio of real filmmakers. The marketing campaign was way ahead of its time. Missing persons posters were made for Heather, Mike and Josh. Flyers were passed out at Sundance asking for information that might lead to the discovery of the missing filmmakers.  The pièce de ré·sis·tance was the film’s website, which included fake police reports about the incident, info on the Blair Witch mythology, photos of the filmmakers at “film class” before embarking on their journey, and more. It’s the kind of stuff you see all the time done to promo modern-day movies, but this was back in the days of AOL. Some people saw it for the cheeky marketing that it was, but a lot of people really took it all at face value, which says a lot about the power of good marketing… and the gullibility of the general public.  The Blair Witch Project isn’t a horror film experience on par with The Exorcist or The Shining, but that’s not a fair comparison. It’s an experience all its own. The film’s impact has been slightly overshadows by the overflow of found footage productions that have come out in its wake, but it remains an influential movie and a potent example of the power of restraint in the horror genre. Even though it’s hella fake, The Blair Witch Project still holds up. John Brhel (@johnbrhel) is an author and pop culture writer from upstate New York. He is the co-author of several books of horror/paranormal fiction, including Corpse Cold: New American Folklore and Resurrection High, and the co-founder of independent book publisher Cemetery Gates Media. He enjoys burritos and has seen Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom way too many times."
"Dec 15, 2022",positive,"[The Blair Witch Project is] the most effective and unsettling horror movie in quite a long time. Just to clarify: after seeing this, you will not sleep well. Invest in a night-light."
"May 26, 2022",positive,"The intimacy of video and the believability of the three students close the gap between film and viewer, truly allowing us to suspend disbelief, something horror films seldom do."
"Apr 11, 2022",negative," With the benefit of hindsight, writing a review of The Blair Witch Project seventeen years after the fact remains a thorny prospect. I can choose to look at the horror movie as a whole, as objectively as possible; or I can simply judge my initial experience seeing the movie in 1999; or I can even consider my subsequent viewings after the rash of “found footage” offshoots it inspired have worn down the gimmick, rendering it no longer effective, if it ever was. After all, more substantial narratives have improved upon the movie’s unsatisfying ending and rather annoying visual experience in the years since its release, even while employing the same “found footage” structure (Chronicle and The Bay come to mind). And though filmmakers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez didn’t invent the genre—Ruggero Deodato’s disagreeable 1980 gorefest Cannibal Holocaust deserves that crown—they popularized it. My take on the film, I suppose, will be a combination of these approaches. So let’s begin with a little background. Much talked-about upon its release, The Blair Witch Project debuted at the Sundance Film Festival and was purchased by Artisan for release the following summer. Shot on the ultra-cheap over eight days in a Maryland forest, Myrick and Sánchez set out to create something people would believe actually happened. They were fascinated by documentaries involving paranormal research and witchcraft. Their production company, Haxan Films, was named after Benjamin Christensen’s 1922 documentary Häxan, in which dramatized sequences recreate haunting moments of torture and ritualistic killing—terrifying stuff. They hired unknown actors to handle the cameras themselves and shoot their experiences in the woods; it was an entirely improvised experience scenario, and the directors interacted with (e.g. messed with) their performers from a distance, resulting in some very authentic responses. Hundreds of hours of footage were cut down to an 81-minute feature. When it came time to release the movie, Artisan’s clever marketing campaign suggested the events depicted therein were real. The movie’s official website (www.BlairWitch.com, still going strong) contained faux newsreel footage and interviews attesting to its authenticity and the real-world existence of the Blair Witch legend, insisting, “In October of 1994 three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland, while shooting a documentary. A year later their footage was found.” Several articles in otherwise respectable magazines and newspapers featured similar “Real or not?”-type articles about the movie. Meanwhile, a so-called documentary appeared on cable television, detailing the origins of the Blair Witch in Burkittsville, formerly Blair. At the time, I was in high school and can attest to the widespread belief that The Blair Witch Project was real, as though any studio large or small would release a supernatural snuff film onto the public. Indeed, when I first saw the film on opening weekend at the Uptown Theater in Minneapolis, MN, the audience buzzed with belief and anticipation. And though I remained skeptical, I cannot deny the movie’s initial impact, especially during the first hour of footage. All playing themselves, amateur filmmakers Heather Donahue and Josh Leonard are joined by a soundman Michael C. Williams on their investigative project into the Blair Witch. The backwoods folktale involved a mysterious figure in the woods, missing children, abnormally thick arm hair, and wooden stick figures. When they set up camp in the Blair Witch’s supposed terrain, the filmmakers experience unsettling sounds in the night, wake up to curious rock piles around their campsite, and quickly become lost. Tensions run high as the situation causes our trio to turn on one another, leading to one disappearance and an abrupt ending that suggests everyone involved in the expedition died horribly. The Blair Witch Project’s most effective quality remains its use of our imagination to build up otherwise silly things into horrifying omens. For example, Josh finds some slime on his backpack. One might just attribute this to slugs or some other organic residue from the forest, but because Josh keeps obsessing about it, we cannot help but feel he was marked by something out there. “Why me?” he keeps asking, as though he hopes to perpetuate a self-fulfilling prophecy. Likewise, small piles of rocks and twig figures have never seemed so scary, because we remember the movie’s initial scenes where the crew records the convincing tales of local bumpkins. These quaint, average folk take hearsay as fact and wholeheartedly embrace the rural legend; the seed has been planted for our imagination to later run wild with terrible possibilities. Unfortunately, what appears onscreen never amounts to much beyond psychological torment. The dark and dense forest setting, consistent shaky handheld camerawork, and footage shot on video and 16mm leave it impossible to make out anything of significance. The characters run through the woods and shout things like “Did you see that?” but the answer is no—no we did not. The camera didn’t see it, and so neither did the audience. Every “ghost hunter” and “paranormal investigator” on television has applied the same tactic. Ultimately, the audience never sees a thing, and the movie remains dependent on what we believe the characters see, as opposed to what we see. By the time the rushed final sequence in a rundown woodland shack comes to pass, we hear Josh’s screams as Mike stands in a corner awaiting execution from who-knows-what, and Heather is presumably bludgeoned to death. When the screen went black and the end credits began to roll, I remember groaning in disappointment along with most of the theater. “That was it?” many spectators complained. I remember thinking, Who was able to safely recover this footage from the basement of the Blair Witch’s house? Was that person tormented too? I also remember thinking the ending robbed the viewer of any emotional closure, but not in a manner that proves satisfying. Many horror films over the years have ended with everyone dying, yet they were much more substantial experiences dramatically. The experience engineered by Myrick and Sánchez has almost no shelf life whatsoever beyond its runtime; after that, all suspension of disbelief has been shattered and the rush is over. Nevertheless, The Blair Witch Project received extremely positive reviews (it still holds an 86% rating on RottenTomatoes), earned a cult following, and became something of an urban legend itself—at first, anyway. Later that same year, it was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture, largely due to backlash about the unsatisfying ending. Amid the accolades, Roger Ebert specifically praised the way the movie exploited our fear of the unknown. And while the unknown remains a compelling force in the horror genre’s best entries (Halloween, The Thing, The Mist, Rosemary’s Baby, etc.), those examples each demonstrate that believing in the unknown is dependent on seeing… something. Sticks and stones and slime don’t amount to much, whereas a shape in the woods or a brief snapshot of a shadow may have elicited our fear beyond the end credits—[Rec] (2007) and its remake Quarantine (2008) are fine examples of this. The Blair Witch Project lost me the first time, after the screen cut to black; during subsequent viewings, I have been even less engaged. As a critic, I must review the overall experience and not merely how frightened I was during the first hour. As a film historian, I must acknowledge that the movie’s phenomenon has come and gone, while its experience and reputation have not aged well."
"Feb 4, 2022",positive,"It sticks with you, as much for its old ideas as for its new ideas. ""Blair Witch"" may represent the cutting-edge of independent filmmaking, but its heart is as ancient and familiar as a Grimm's fairy tale."
"Oct 28, 2021",positive," Directed by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez, The Blair Witch Project follows three student filmmakers (Heather Donahue’s Heather, Joshua Leonard’s Josh, and Michael C. Williams’ Mike) as they travel into a Maryland forest to shoot a documentary about a local urban legend. Filmmakers Myrick and Sánchez deliver a typically erratic found-footage thriller that ultimately fares best in its opening and closing sections, as the movie, which is certainly never boring, admittedly does suffer from a hit-and-miss midsection that’s focused largely on the protagonists’ less-than-enthralling lost-in-the-woods exploits (ie the relentless squabbling eventually becomes repetitive, to say the least). It’s clear, then, that The Blair Witch Project benefits substantially from the superb efforts of its sympathetic performers and a narrative that’s been suffused with attention-grabbing, distinctly spooky set-pieces, and there’s little doubt, as well, that Myrick and Sánchez do a superb job of initially drawing the viewer into the proceedings with a first act devoted to character development and Blair Witch backstory. The movie is, of course, at its best in its increasingly bleak (and impressively terrifying) climactic stretch, with the now-iconic finale ensuring that the whole thing concludes on as memorable and nightmare-inducing a note as one could possibly have hoped – which consequently does cement The Blair Witch Project‘s place as a strong entry within a notoriously uneven genre."
"Oct 21, 2021",positive," Spooks love thresholds, gateways and portals. They famously congregate on Walpurgis Night, the evening before May Day that marks the end of spring and the advent of summer – and conversely they also gather on Halloween, the night that closes autumn and heralds the onset of winter.  This is why October in general and Halloween in particular loom so large in the genre calendar. For Christians, it’s the night before All Saints’ (or Hallows’) Day, although it also overlaps with the Celtic, pagan Samhain, a celebration of the end of harvest that’s also a liminal time when the border between our world and the Otherworld becomes fluid.  Halloween is a festival of masks and costumes, of carnivalesque inversions, supernatural encroachments and demonic incursions, when the cold grip of winter sets in, and the dead mix freely with the living. Essentially, it’s horror time – and it has lent its name to a horror franchise which, including reboots and reimaginings, has now been stalking for 43 years. Autumn, however, is a flexible season. Traditionally, for English speakers, it began on Lammas Day (1 August) and ended on Halloween (31 October), while meteorologists and modernity see it spanning the start of September to the end of November, and North Americans place it between the autumnal equinox (21 to 24 September) and the winter solstice (21 to 22 December). So while, unsurprisingly, Halloween will, both as a key autumnal – and eldritch – calendar event, keep recurring in this selection of autumnal horror films, the final choice falls in November. It might be supposed that Robert Mulligan’s adaptation of Harper Lee’s 1960 novel covers events that are mostly summer-bound in Depression-era Alabama, and that the film is more coming-of-ager and courtroom drama than horror. But young siblings Scout (Mary Badham) and Jem (Phillip Alford) live in fear of a reclusive neighbour whom they nickname ‘Boo’ and magnify with their own terrifying mythology, and so an element of southern gothic is there from the start. After the film’s pivotal court case is over, a coda takes place on one long October night, in which all the film’s themes of crime, prejudice and scapegoating come together in a moment of autumnal horror. As Jem and Scout return home through the woods – Scout’s perspective (and ours) restricted by her Halloween costume – they are stalked and attacked by a drunken, vindictive man with a knife, and rescued from murder by ‘Boo’. It was made by José Ramón Larraz in the same year as his Vampyres, and similarly features lesbianism, violence and a big gothic pad in the English countryside – but that is where all similarity ends. For this moody psychodrama – Britain’s official Palme d’Or entry at Cannes – comes much closer to Hitchcock’s Psycho (1960) or Polanski’s Repulsion (1965), as it traces the unraveling of strange, sensitive Helen (Angela Pleasance), returned from abroad to the old family estate in the company of her more worldly writer friend Anne (Lorna Heilbron).  With the leaves on the trees starting to turn a neurotic yellow, the property’s grounds yield up buried ghosts, as the infantilised Helen confounds the living with the dead in her secluded doll’s house of repressed sexuality and murderous desire. Like Helen’s former friend Cory, Larraz’s film disappeared only to resurface, when its original negative – long believed lost – was recently rediscovered and restored. Bob Clark’s Black Christmas (1974) may have inaugurated the ‘calendar killer’, but it was John Carpenter’s film that would make Halloween a fixture in the slasher annals as (according to the now iconic poster) “the night he came home!” The pronoun ‘it’, though, is preferred to ‘he’ by psychiatrist Dr Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance) – named for a character from Alfred Hitchcock’s ur-slasher Psycho (1960) – to denote his escaped patient Michael Myers, a deranged murderer of the silent, heavy-breathing type. As Myers now sets his sights on bookish virgin Laurie Strode (Janet Leigh’s debuting daughter Jamie Lee Curtis) and other co-eds in the red-and-yellow-leafy suburbs of Haddonfield, Illinois, Loomis refers to him, unscientifically, as ‘the evil’, while evidently himself relishing crouching behind bushes in the dark and frightening children. After 15 years under this doctor’s supervision, it’s unsurprising that Myers’ boyhood psychopathy has ripened. Autumn is the season of harvest, and Fritz Kiersch’s film, adapted from a short story by Stephen King, is folk horror fixated on reaping what’s been sown. In the fictional backroads town of Gatlin, Nebraska, the failure of the corn crop leads local children to sacrifice all the community’s god-fearing grownups to an agricultural deity (“He who walks behind the rows”), and to install their own underage cult falling somewhere between William Golding’s 1954 novel Lord of the Flies and Narciso Ibáñez Serrador’s 1976 film Who Can Kill a Child? Three years after this teen takeover, an adult couple (Peter Horton and Linda Hamilton) becomes ensnared in the town on 31 October, and ultimately burns down the now fertile fields. This corn-fed, sometimes corny study of outlandish religious zealotry taps into urban anxieties about the Bible Belt, before restoring adult order after a Halloween of kiddy chaos.  “Certainly,” Dr Lin Pascoe (Gillian Bevan) replies to Parkinson in the studio. “There are more reports on Halloween than any other night of the year.” The fact that Lesley Manning’s Ghostwatch, written by Steven Volk, was also first broadcast on Halloween in 1992 only added to its reality effect, as this telemovie alarmed viewers with the possibility that the very act of watching was putting them at risk in their own homes.  “In October of 1994, three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland while shooting a documentary,” reads the text that opens Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez’s ultra-low-budget feature, which would set the template for all the ‘found footage’ horror to come over the next decades, while yielding a massive return on investment.  Doom is coming as surely as winter for Heather Donahue, Michael C. Williams and Joshua Leonard. Even as something messes with them at night, this turned-around trio find themselves irrationally retreading the same mythic pathways that they earlier filmed locals relating – and the leafy sparseness and longer nights that mid-autumn brings only add to the bleakness of the film’s atmosphere. For here the endless trees, bare and featureless, become ever more disorienting – and nothing quite captures the group’s sheer desperation like the sight of a despondent Mike chewing on a fallen, dry leaf. Sony’s first computer animated film begins in territory familiar from To Kill a Mockingbird, with kids D.J. and Chowder spying on the house opposite, and exchanging far-fetched stories about its cantankerous, toy-stealing old resident Nebbercracker. Yet here the setting is unambiguously autumnal, in what is possibly cinema’s first (and only) opening ‘single-take’ sequence focalised entirely through a deciduous leaf. Animation lets an impossible shot closely track the golden-hued leaf as it is blown by wind from a tree to the piles of similarly coloured leaves on the sidewalk below, is swept up again by a little girl’s passing tricycle, and finally comes to rest at the titular house’s front door.  The rest of Gil Kenan’s gateway horror for children concerns a house not so much haunted as physically possessed by the angry, child-hating soul of Nebbercracker’s deceased wife Constance. Trick or treaters, beware. Set, as its title implies, over Halloween, but confounding its timelines and storylines to dizzying effect, Michael Dougherty’s debut feature is an almost-anthology of five tales that criss-cross and interweave over one long night in a small Ohio town. This structure, with its disinterest in chronological linearity and its clashing of different narrative strands, introduces a jigsaw-like tricksiness more akin to Robert Altman’s Short Cuts (1993) than to your average horror omnibus. What unifies all these episodes, beyond their jagged singularity of time and place, is a nostalgic EC Comics-style brand of twisted morality that sees characters punished for infringing the rules of this night when the supernatural runs riot. There are serial killers, ghosts, werewolves and a candy-brandishing, pumpkin-masked child named (and embodying) Sam Hain – but the victims here are all getting their just deserts for failing to respect the spirit of Halloween. Over this long dark night of the soul, our anguished antiheroine – dressed in angel’s wings – must decide whether she will keep her baby or give it up. This choice is staged as a garishly stylised, jarringly nightmarish reassemblage of Halloween’s traditional iconography into something of an altogether different hue. Marking its difference from so much Halloween-focused autumnal horror both by its title and by beginning on All Souls’ Day (two days after Halloween), Rainer Sarnet’s straight-faced, surreal feature similarly defies categorisation. For it’s all at once a slice of 19th-century Estonian ethnography/anthropology, a bizarre, funny, surprisingly bawdy folk horror, and a beautifully stylised (if often messy and muddy) monochrome study in expressionism.  Here villagers resort to all manner of supernatural ploys and deceptions to assist their thievery so they can survive the coming winter (and its associated plague) in a rural backwater that, for all its small size, still manages to accommodate devilish automata, werewolves, ghosts, vampires, necromancy, somnambulism and witchcraft. Yet at its heart, this is a tragic love triangle, as two young locals vainly use enchantments to make their cold nights warmer, even as autumn’s encroaching end brings its deadly chill to everything. "
"Apr 14, 2021",positive," Congratulations! With your recent purchase of a brand-new Roku/Apple TV/Amazon Fire Stick you’re ready to – as Obi-Wan Kenobi said – take your first step into a larger world. That larger world is, of course, the world of cord cutting, in which a seemingly endless supply of streaming apps, services, and content are available instantaneously at your fingertips. But with so many options of things to watch spread out across so many different services changing literally by the day, what’s worth binge-watching before it expires and you’d have to – (GASP) – pay for it? Allow Crossing the Streams to be your official guide to what’s worth watching before it expires, what’s just been made available, and what’s just plain damn good. V/H/S 2 (Netflix): The found footage subgenre is dead. Long live the found footage subgenre. The flame that was kindled with The Blair Witch Project and fueled gasolinically by the Paranormal Activity franchise was pretty much officially killed by the negative response to the albeit commercially successful (and underrated, IMO) Blair Witch in 2016. Sure, our obsession with found footage horror films spawned plenty of mistakes (Willow Creek, The Devil Inside, Apollo 18), but it also uncovered a lot of gems (Lake Mungo, The Last Exorcism, The Bay). One of the more critically successful entries into the subgenre is 2013’s V/H/S 2, the second installment in what would turn out to be a trilogy of horror anthologies. Its predecessor may have set the template, but V/H/S 2 set the standard, with shorts dealing with everything from zombies (“A Ride in the Park”) to aliens (“Slumber Party Alien Abduction”). Simon Barrett (You’re Next, The Guest), Gareth Evans (The Raid, Apostle), Eduardo Sánchez (The Blair Witch Project), and more of their ilk lend their talents to a truly terrifying film that successfully found the middle ground between innovation and motivation for how to utilize handheld POV footage in the most haunting ways. The film will expire from Netflix on October 24th, which is only a scary thought if you don’t also have a subscription to either Hulu or Amazon Prime. Signs (Hulu): M. Night Shyamalan is back in the news and for the first time in a long time, it’s because people are excited about something he’s doing (more on that in a bit). We’ve ragged on the guy for so long – mostly deservedly so – that it’s easy to forget that at one point in our lives a Shyamalan release was accompanied by a lot of excitement and hype (perhaps too much). Seeing as The Sixth Sense grossed over $670 million worldwide to go along with 6 Oscar nominations, you’d be forgiven to think that his continued success wasn’t all but guaranteed. Unbreakable wasn’t nearly as financially or critically successful as its predecessor, so it was Signs that showed – at the time, at least – that Shyamalan wasn’t a fluke as a writer/director. Sure, the film has some troubling perspective on faith (God responds well to your anger!), the twist is a little nonsensical (would people with pollen allergies build a house in a field of daisies?), and Mel Gibson exists, but the film features some great performances from Joaquin Phoenix, Cherry Jones, and Abigail Breslin in her first big screen role. In addition, I’m a sucker for an effective scary movie that involves aliens and if you’re gonna tell me that you didn’t jump during that scene in the basement with the alien arm, I’m gonna call you a liar. Signs will disappear from Hulu like the aliens’ hope for conquering Earth on October 31st.  Unbreakable (Hulu): We were all rightfully skeptical when The Visit was released, but its success combined with the response to Split resulted in the aforementioned excitement for a project that the internet has apparently wanted since the release of Shyamalan’s follow up to The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable. A somber and seemingly prophetically introspective take on a superhero genre that had not yet caught fire, Unbreakable is the favorite film for many people who have seen multiple Shyamalan films, even those that hate most of what he’s done (I’m living proof!). The film stars Bruce Willis as David Dunn, a stadium security guard who either doesn’t realize or doesn’t want to acknowledge that his being the sole unscathed survivor of a train derailment signals that he’s something more than ordinary. As moody as The Sixth Sense with a twist ending that packs arguably even more of an emotional punch, Unbreakable holds such an elevated place in my heart that I’m actually afraid to rewatch it out of fear that it won’t hold up to my memory. In that respect, perhaps I’ll just let it expire on October 31st to help preserve its legacy. Predator (HBO Now): I’m not sure if you heard, but Shane Black’s The Predator is not only controversial, but also bad. Confirming again that it’s best to let sleeping corpses lie, The Predator fails so thoroughly to both entertain and engage on its own merits that its most fun moments are when it references John McTiernan’s action classic. The Oscar-nominated Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle (it was for Best Visual Effects, but still…) aspires to be nothing more than a bunch of burly guys with big guns being hunted down one by one by an even burlier alien with an even bigger gun. The film delivers exactly what you’d expect from a Reagan Era action film: gunfire, explosions, muscles, violence, and a final one-on-one showdown between Good Guy and Bad Guy. Predator isn’t reinventing the wheel, but it’s having a lot of fun with what it’s doing. Come for the machismo, but stay for Schwarzenegger’s one-liners. Just be sure you come before October 31st. All of the titles mentioned in this section have either just been made available, will be available soon, or their rights have recently been renewed. Either way, they’re not going anywhere anytime soon, which is good because unless you’ve got little ones who are going trick or treating, neither are you. The Blair Witch Project (Prime/Hulu/Shudder): With how far digital and social technology have come in making the horrors of reality quickly and easily accessible to a mass audience, it’s easy to forget how much of a phenomenon The Blair Witch Project was when it was unleashed in 1999. Shot by unknown directors with first-time actors and heralded by a promotional campaign that blurred the lines between fiction and reality, The Blair Witch Project wasn’t just a success; it was a landmark in the evolution of cinema; an exemplary film that popularized a subgenre that had previously existed, but was little seen or respected. The directors’ approach to the creation of the film was largely unprecedented at the time, a seemingly organized cinematic improvisation that kept the actors largely in the dark – figuratively and literally – and relying a lot on luck and chemistry to generate scares and atmosphere. The result was a tiny film with a budget of $60,000 that grossed almost $250 million worldwide, spawned two sequels, and inspired countless obnoxious parodies. By today’s standards (i.e. the aforementioned V/H/S 2), The Blair Witch Project is pretty tame in regards to what it chooses to show you – or, more accurately, withhold from showing you – but for its time, it was a significant achievement. You’ve been able to venture back into the woods since October 1st. The Nightmare Before Christmas (Hulu): The debate over whether The Nightmare Before Christmas is a Halloween or Christmas movie has been raging for decades and will likely continue to rage in perpetuity, but personally, it just doesn’t feel like it’s officially the Halloween season until I hear that haunting song. The Nightmare Before Christmas was inspired by a poem that Tim Burton wrote upon seeing a department store replace its Halloween decorations with those of the Christmas season and was brought to life remarkably by Henry Selick, whose stop motion work on Coraline would later net him a well-deserved Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature. The Nightmare Before Christmas is one of those rare holiday films that seems to transcend generations, annually being revisited and enjoyed by everyone from children to adults, which is likely a result of many adults having grown up with it passing it along to their children. Since the film was released in 1993, Jack Skellington has become a cultural icon, showing up everywhere from Hot Topic to PlayStation and, as of October 2nd, to Hulu. Into the Dark: “The Body” (Hulu): If you’ve somehow missed the incessant ads for Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween on Hulu, then you might be unaware of “Huluween,” the streaming service’s rollout and promotion of all their content, both original and borrowed, dealing with things that go bump in the night. Hulu is cleverly using the Halloween season to debut their horror anthology series, Into the Dark, which will feature monthly, feature-length installments inspired by a holiday. Its premiere episode, “The Body,” follows a hitman who has to transport a body on Halloween night and is co-written and directed by Paul Davis, based on a short film he directed in 2013 starring Game of Thrones’ Alfie Allen. Reviews for “The Body” aren’t great, but as one of the few fans of the defunct Masters of Horror and Fear Itself, I’m ready to give Into the Dark a chance. “The Body” premiered on October 5th.  Nightbreed (Amazon Prime): Clive Barker had made a name for himself as a horror writer even before he adapted his own “The Hellbound Heart” into 1987’s Hellraiser, but it was that film’s success that allowed him to adapt another of his works, the novel “Cabal,” into 1990’s Nightbreed, a film that spoke to Barker’s social philosophy as much as Hellraiser spoke to his sexuality. A horror precursor to Bryan Singer’s X-Men, Nightbreed follows Aaron Boone (Craig Sheffer), a young man who has dreams of a land called Midian, where a group of friendly monsters – the titular Nightbreed –  are hiding from humans who wish to see them destroyed. The fragile mental state that these dreams bring about in Aaron is exploited by his psychotherapist, Philip K. Decker (horror filmmaking icon, David Cronenberg), who is need of a patsy to cover up his serial killings. In Nightbreed, it’s clear that both Barker’s and our empathy rests with the monsters, an innocent group of outsiders who are hated, hunted, and killed by a homogenous society that sees anyone and anything different as being abhorrent. One doesn’t have to think too hard to see how the film’s message can find resonance in today’s social and political climate. You’ve been able to meet the breed since October 1st.  The Descent (HBO Now): Quite simply, The Descent is one of the best horror movies of the last 20 years. I’ve seen a lot of horror films since Neil Marshall’s claustrophobic film was released in 2005, but aside from Ari Aster’s Hereditary, none of them have scared me as thoroughly as The Descent. Sure, I’ve seen the film so many times that the jump scares no longer elevate me, but to this day, I still have a clear memory of seeing the film in theaters and beholding an entire row of young teenagers in front of me literally jump from their seats during the first big creature reveal. Even if it weren’t for the jump scares, The Descent is still a smart screenplay populated with fully realized characters who are kick ass women fighting for their lives amidst the enclosed caves so effectively manufactured by production designer Simon Bowles and lit so starkly by DP Sam McCurdy. Admittedly, high definition releases haven’t been kind to the limited CGI work the film contains, but everything else about it rules – just look at that poster! None of Marshall’s directorial work since has been able to equal the greatness of The Descent (one thing came pretty close), but since October 1st, you haven’t really had to worry about watching anything else anyway. The Haunting of Hill House (Netflix): Netflix’s The Haunting of Hill House series isn’t the first time Shirley Jackson’s novel has been adapted by a filmmaker (nor, unfortunately, even the second time), but based on both critical and audience responses, it seems like third time’s a charm. The Haunting of Hill House was created and entirely directed by Mike Flanagan, whose exemplary horror work can already been found spread across the annals of Netflix (Oculus, Hush, and Gerald’s Game are all waiting for you as well). Stephen King has called Flanagan’s work on the series “close to a work of genius,” which is quite convenient seeing as the Massachusetts-born filmmaker is currently at work adapting “Doctor Sleep,” the sequel to “The Shining.” As of this writing, I’m only two episodes into the series and while the scares have been limited, the work done on building up the characters, their relationships, and what’s at stake for them all has been phenomenal. Since his debut feature, Absentia, Flanagan has proven that he knows that you can’t be scared for characters if you don’t care for them first. If Twitter is to be believed, then there are plenty of scares to come. I eagerly await them. You’ve been able to visit Hill House since October 12th.  Somewhere in between the titles that are expiring and the titles that have just entered this world lay those that we’ve either taken for granted, forgotten about, or just plain didn’t realize we could watch for free. Let’s fix that because they’re damn good and they’re coming to get you, Barbara. Halloween (Shudder): It wouldn’t be Halloween if you didn’t watch John Carpenter’s titular horror classic. The film that gave us Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Myers, and that iconic score is still as haunting and effective as it was when it came out 40 years ago thanks in part to Carpenter’s understanding of how to utilize camera movement and staging to unsettle viewers with a subtle sense of voyeurism. On top of giving us one of the most iconic horror movie villains of all time, Halloween also brought the fear and paranoia that was affecting the country at large at the time into seemingly safe and secure suburbia. If you plan on checking out David Gordon Green’s sequel, then you’d best watch or rewatch the original classic first (if for no other reason than to understand the references). Shudder has also brought Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers and Halloween 5 into the fold for October if you’re thirsty for more. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (Shudder): The 1970’s saw another little known filmmaker release a low-budget horror film that history would prove to be a seminal work in the future of the genre. Tobe Hooper’s output after The Texas Chainsaw Massacre hasn’t been treated as kindly as John Carpenter’s, and his other big hit, Poltergeist, arguably isn’t even his. But when the Texan passed away in 2017 he was buried with the immortal legacy of being the one who created Leatherface. Many horror films set out to disturb the audience, but few are able to concoct an atmosphere of such thorough visual and aural unpleasantness that manages to somehow behoove the film. Though released in 1974 and containing far less gore than a film with both “chainsaw” and “massacre” in its title would imply, TCM is a remarkable albeit macabre cinematic achievement, a film that feels as hot, smelly, and horrible as Sally’s (Marilyn Burns) terror would lead us to believe it was inside the Sawyer abode (aided in no small part by the real-life horrific working conditions, I’m sure ).  Oculus (Netflix): With The Haunting of Hill House, It seems like Mike Flanagan might finally get the mainstream embracing that he deserves. While Ouija: Origin of Evil and Oculus were relative box office and critical successes, he’s still only on the cusp of being a household name in the horror genre with two of his last three releases, Hush and Gerald’s Game, being Netflix exclusives (excluding the complicated release history of Before I Wake). Of all those titles just mentioned, Oculus is the one that seems to be the most overlooked, which is a shame, because the film, starring a post-Doctor Who pre-Guardians of the Galaxy Karen Gillan, is an effective psychological ghost story. The film revolves around a sister, Gillan, who is trying to exonerate her brother, Brenton Thwaites, from murder by proving that his troubled history is the result of paranormal phenomenon caused by a haunted relic. It may sound a bit ridiculous, but Flanagan and co-writer Jeff Howard do a fantastic job of making people question whether the threat to our characters is real or imagined right up until the very end of the film.  Blair Witch (Amazon Prime): Grossing over $45 million on a budget 1/9th of that, Blair Witch could be considered a success, but the backlash was so loud and swift that it put the kibosh on not only any sequel ideas, but also on any future mainstream found footage films. Critics said the scares were tired and the film failed to cover any new ground, but considering the innovative things that Simon Barrett and Adam Wingard were trying to do (warning: spoilers) with both revisiting and adding onto pre-existing mythology, I think people were just tired with the genre and had no patience for a sequel to a decades-old film. Two years removed from the backlash, I think that viewers of Blair Witch would find a well-made horror film that attempts to inject new genre elements into a franchise that was influential to so many filmmakers, including the two attempting to serve it. It’s not the best found footage film ever, but it’s also not Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension. If you’ve been reading this blog regularly, then you’ve already picked up on the fact it’s published mid-week. This is primarily done for the purposes of time; mainly how much I don’t have of it and how much of it I take to do research and compile the plethora of titles and the platforms on which they stream for me to write about here. Often, however, many titles expire before the blog is published and even before I sit down to write it, meaning that a whole host of great content is lost before you even click. In light of that, here’s a brief recap of the titles that have expired between the publishing of the last “Crossing the Streams” entry and this one. Just like characters in comic books though, streaming titles never truly die; they just reappear at later dates in venues that don’t make as much sense, so stay tuned!"
"Mar 19, 2021",negative," We back baby! It's been far too long since we've been all up in your inbox and we're so happy to get back into our weekly groove. We don't need to tell you that the world is a mess right now. But we couldn't let spooky szn pass without proper acknowledgment.So for our very first (of what will hopefully be annual!) Halloween issue, we've got Zosha on the existential terror of Unfriended: Dark Web and Cate on the disappointment of watching The Blair Witch Project too late. Spooky szn may be on its way out but there's no reason we can't wallow in the tiny terrors of movies that are just a little too real, or don't live up to our expectations.We hope you've all been well. We've missed you and we're so happy to get back to yelling about movies. Let the games begin! Now that description obviously strips away a lot of the nuance between the two. Most importantly, when Cate and I sat down to watch Dark Web together (🥰), I jokingly said “I hope that this has no supernatural element at all, just the actual dark web.” And lo, it did! And honestly folks, it was spookier to me than the first Unfriended, which is supernatural horror. The first one is a haunted Skype call; the second is a hacked one. In the first, the plot works hard to get you to think that these people “deserve it” (at least, in the way horror movies can warp your logic and stress a sort of puritanical punishment system for dumb teenage mistakes), while in the second they do nothing but fight it. But with either, you get a sense that these are forces far, far beyond the control and understanding that we simple humans can grasp. Interestingly, as someone who watched the second one first (and thus, was informed that there was ~ahem~ no way for there to be any carryover characters from the last film), I found myself watching Unfriended 2 with much more suspense. Each time the characters attempt a new way to outsmart the hacker—who makes the danger terrifyingly real with a physical and cyber presence—they felt tantalizingly close to outsmarting the bad guy. This was more than just running upstairs as opposed to running outside when escaping the masked killer, these were creative, problem-solving endeavors that I certainly wouldn’t have thought of. And, after all, that’s what makes for compelling horror (and, in particular, slasher) film fare: smart decisions that don’t pay off. As such, Unfriended 2: Dark Web left me on far closer to the edge of my seat than I would’ve thought for a film with such a low-hanging fruit of a name.  So, of course I eventually turned my attention to Unfriended. Here I was, mid-way through the longest September, living through a pandemic and political tidal wave, and ravenous for one horror film after the next. I am sure that there are already personal essays out in the void that make the case for why me (and so many of my friends) crave horror films at this moment in time; something about Halloween just around the corner, and COVID on the other side of my mask. And after watching the two, I can say that this franchise feels much, much closer to home than so many do—even something like Host, another computer-based horror film.  You might know about Host more by its logline: filmed post-March 2020, we follow a haunted Zoom call as the participants get “kicked off” one-by-one. It’s a tight hour, the length of their free Zoom call. But that’s the funny thing: real ones (all of us, by now) know your free Zoom call only lasts 45 minutes! A bit of movie magic we sacrifice for the plot, sure—but it would feel less nagging if the film was more plot driven. Mostly what you hear is what you get: the Zoom call is haunted because someone decided to fuck with the Zoom seance, and that’s about as much propelling the story as you’re going to get. It’s got jump scares, but that’s the entirety of your Host haunts.  Compare that with something like Unfriended 2: A 20-something boy finds a laptop in the lost and found of his local internet cafe, thinks it’s his good fortune and takes it home just in time for his weekly game night with friends. As he starts logging in and loading up, he finds the previous owner of the computer left some things you might not want to check—like portals to the dark web, and all the evil therein.  In Unfriended 2, the “dark web” works because it feels just as otherworldly as the undead. It’s the Upside Down, where our laws can’t touch, and we’re vulnerable just for turning around and checking on our loved ones. Step wrong and you’re doomed.  Perhaps, at this moment, it felt so scary not because I’m going on the dark web at all (parents who read this, I cannot stress this enough: I do not, and neither should you!). But because...jesus what the fuck would we do if our computer was haunted at this point? Me, my friends, my loved ones—many of us have had to repair our laptops or swap out computers during this time, and never has our station felt quite so precarious as in those moments. Yes, that may be a dumb thing to say during a global pandemic! But I make my money via the internet, and without a portal—or using one that’s been contaminated in some way—I’d be screwed. And that’s all ignoring the friends I’ve been talking off the ledge, trying to counteract the brainworms they kicked up from reading the wrong kind of news.  Post-viewing, I sat trying to remember if I heard anything about either Unfriended when it came out, and if I intentionally shrugged off the film or just happened to let it pass me by. Aside from a stray line or two that felt reminiscent of a trailer, I couldn’t think of a feeling I’d had on it in the past, good or bad. But I also don’t think it would have felt as personal to me back then. After a slow build of knee-jerk twitching when characters went to parties or hugged each other, here was something that so closely resembled more of my day-to-day: An Apple desktop of with folders haphazardly saved to it, toggling between a video chat with loved ones I haven’t seen in far too long and some internet bullshit, and about 18 different ways of messaging someone (which I am utilizing all at once). To see that corrupted felt almost personal, certainly just as disorienting as my instinctive glance to the clock in Unfriended 2’s menu bar.  But, if I’ve learned anything else during this Autumnal Pandemic Horror Fest of mine, it’s that I am constantly eager for something that strikes the perfect balance of horror: I won’t watch films that rely on torture porn or sexual assault, or anything that approaches either. I want enough plot to keep me going, but not so much that it turns into a rumination of “why do we survive?” (I’m looking at you Underwater). And it’s not fun horror if the participants don’t understand what’s happening, at least enough for a chance to fight back.  Unfriended 2: Dark Web (and Unfriended, for that matter) surpassed all my qualifications and expectations, surprisingly. It makes you care about the people enough that you can stake your standard thriller bets on who lives, who dies, who tells the story. It uses its in-screen device well, and has a sort of digital native understanding of the laptop. Things you don’t understand can be easily waved away with flattened, complicated expectations about world-building and evil. And at this moment in time, the killer has never felt quite so close to home. It’s somehow worse than the house being haunted—it’s your life out there, and there’s nothing you can do about it.  When I was 10, I was very, very afraid of The Blair Witch™. I was old enough to have some semblance of how the world worked but still young enough to be irrationally terrified of it. It just so happens that I was also a child with an overactive imagination, so the contemporaneous marketing for The Blair Witch Project swore me off the movie for years. No one seemed to know if it was real or not, and I didn’t need to torment my dreams with the scariest movie of all time. Now though— as a full adult who loves horror films and has generally gotten a handle on her stress dreams—the time felt right to backfill this missing part of my horror canon. Unfortunately, it didn’t quite live up to the hype.  It isn’t the movie’s fault. In the time since it debuted, grosser, more terrible movies have come into existence because that’s how technological advances and the onward march of time function. And I too got older and more able to handle an onscreen beheading or two. Watching the movie gave me the same bewildered feeling I got when I finally watched A Clockwork Orange in college. “This is what all the fuss was about?” I am nothing if not morbidly curious, and have always been drawn precisely to the things I suspect will upset me. (NBC’s Hannibal anyone?) I’m too nosy and my FOMO is too strong to not be part of the conversation. But as with A Clockwork Orange, values and standards have changed dramatically in the time between The Blair Witch Project’s release and when I finally saw it. Frankly, it’s got nothing on John Wick 3 (which I still have not gotten more than 15 minutes into despite really wanting to know what the deal is with Halle Berry and those dogs!) As you likely already know, The Blair Witch Project is about a group of three student documentarians who travel to an old town to investigate an old ghost tale. When they trek into the forest and get lost, they slowly lose their sanity and each other before being killed by the town’s demons. The problem is that The Blair Witch Project is simply too quaint for the sensibilities of someone who cut her teeth on slasher films and murderous ghost stories. And a big part of me regrets that! If I had seen this film closer to release, I have no doubt that I would remember it as a formative piece of terrifying media instead of simply an ambitious example of the possibilities of independent film.  And the film is good, make no mistake. It’s moody and tense and the stakes increase exponentially in a way that I’m sure was legitimately upsetting at the time. But I’d been pre-warned that there were no jump scares and no actual Blair Witch looming between shots, so there was an added sense that I was building to nothing. (My most controversial opinion is that jump scares are good actually.) The film it reminded me of most was actually Uncut Gems, a movie that stressed me out so badly I had to watch it in two installments. My nerves can’t take a lot of CONSTANT YELLING and when the intrepid documentarians behind The Blair Witch finally realize and accept that they are hopelessly lost in the woods, running out of food and turning on each other, I could feel my heart rate increase. Voices raised, they argue and bicker and blame each other for their plight, and I was much more annoyed that they wouldn’t calm the fuck down than I was scared at the prospect of them being gutted by a ghost. I guess it’s a marker of my adulthood that conflict was more upsetting to me than the specter of a serial killing ghost. But in the end, the inevitable death of the three students did not scare me. It frustrated me. With no visible villains other than their own terror, I was annoyed they hadn’t managed to get it together and save themselves. (Never go into the creepy house!) But, it must be said that The Blair Witch was set in 1999. Maybe that trope hadn’t entered the canon yet ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. "
"Sep 3, 2020",negative," Overrated. 

Yes, I'm truly tempted to end my review there but out of respect for those who actually read my reviews I suppose I should offer at least a semblance of an explanation for why I consider 1999's ""The Blair Witch Project,"" the low-budget wonder film from Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez which was originally budgeted at $35,000 and ended up grossing over $140 million in the US alone sparking a series of spoofs and one pathetic sequel. 

I was looking forward to seeing ""The Blair Witch Project."" I'd heard enough about its uniqueness, and I've always admired the low-budget independent filmmaker so I thought...""Wow, a perfect combination. This will be great."" 

Then, I immediately became distracted by glaring technical mistakes. Sure, well, there was only a $35,000 budget...well below, way way way below the budget for many small, independent films. I could forgive a few technical mistakes. It's hard to reshoot mistakes when you simply don't have the budget to do so.

Then, however, I began to notice myself yawning. Hmmm. A suspenseful, horror type film and I'm yawning...I'm noticeably bored and cringing at the screams of one of the leads, Heather Donahue. Joshua Leonard and Michael Williams didn't help matters, and, ultimately, I found myself feeling restless and waiting for that moment of suspense...that glimpse into the horror I'd been promised. 

It never happened. 

""The Blair Witch Project"" is not a horrible film. I've seen many worse horror films over the years, and the vast majority have been worse than this one. It isn't so much that I find ""Blair Witch"" a bad film...it's that I find it so remarkably bland and lifeless when everything I'd read from box-office reports to reviews to audience response offered me fear and anxiety and horror. I felt none of these things while watching the film. 

Truthfully, I found myself much more entertained by the spoof, ""The Bare Wench Project,"" a sexy, silly romp that made me laugh and made me smile. This film offered laughs only when the horror was truly disappointing and never actually made me smile.

""The Blair Witch Project"" is, more than anything, a testimony to the power of marketing a film. The filmmakers took a random, festival type approach to marketing the film including a massive internet onslaught that put the film directly into the faces of the young adult crowd it was targeting. 

The end result became history's most successful independent film and continues to set the benchmark for independent films in terms of box-office and marketing. I'm sure you've experienced the same feeling I have here...those moments when you look up at a screen or you read the weekend box-office receipts and you find yourself completely floored that a film has defied expectations and become a hit almost despite itself. ""The Blair Witch Project"" can lay claim to being the most successful independent film in terms of box-office percentages. When you think about it and all the incredible indie films available, isn't that just kind of sad? "
"May 24, 2020",positive,The most remarkable thing about Donahue's work in this movie is that she is rarely seen on camera. She brings depth and emotional nuance to Heather's character through just her voicework and breathing.
"Feb 26, 2020",positive,Sanchez and Myrick are also smart enough not to undercut the potency of their tale by attempting to explain the unexplainable. They leave us with a mystery capable of haunting our dreams.
"Oct 14, 2019",positive,"One of its great strengths is that it breaks the teenage bloodbath formula. There is not a Jason or a Freddy to be found. Instead, Blair Witch is a thinking person's horror movie that exploits the imagination's power to terrify."
"Aug 7, 2019",positive," With the second installment (second because let’s just forget about that horrid Book Of Bleh) of The Blair Witch Project coming out in a few weeks, aptly titled Blair Witch, I thought it would be appropriate to review the original.  I first watched the movie when I was at the oldest 7 or 8 in my cousins’ basement. At that point, the virality of the movie had just calmed down, but it was still widely known as one of the most horrifying movies of all time. This is proven by the fact that I nearly broke down crying when the main menu came up. The second time I watched it I was in high school and still nearly broke down crying (or did). However, now that I’m at a point in my life that I am confident in my abilities a fan and studier of cinema I am seeing The Blair Witch Project as a landmark cinematic experience. While I think a lot of the early acclaim was because of the viral marketing and debate behind its authenticity, looking at it through the lens of a film proves that it is a modern classic. If you somehow have been lost in the woods in Maryland for two decades, The Blair Witch Project tells the story three amateur filmmakers — Josh, Heather, and Mike — who embark into Burkittsville, Maryland to create a documentary on the legend of the Blair Witch. Much of what we learn about the legend and experiences of the town folk are through interviews with actual citizens of townspeople who recount the terrifying tale of a witch that lurks in the woods. As the “documentary” unfolds, one thing is strikingly clear. The filmmaking style and performance still feel so real that I found myself at some points still being tricked into thinking this was actual found footage. Of course, this lends itself to the way it was filmed. But you have to appreciate the vision that the directors had to have had before beginning production and incredible talent that these actors possess for improvisation. Now, here’s the thing. There are very few movies that I have become emotional during. However, there are parts of this movie that I became physically unnerved for the characters and frankly saddened for them. At some point, the movie because less about the witch and more about the fragility of the human psyche. What are you thinking? Who do you blame? The scenario unfolds with so much real and raw emotion that it feels claustrophobic. You feel trapped in the forest with them. While the concept may feel outdated or overdone you have to remember that this is the first time a movie like this ever existed. Yes, mockumentaries predated The Blair Witch Project, but no movie has come close to even committing this type of immersive experience to film. The viral marketing and cultural phenomenon aside, the movie still holds up as a masterclass in tension, atmosphere, and horror. While the style has been copied countless times from degrees of success — the first Paranormal Activity, Cloverfield, Chronicle — to questionable — The Chernobyl Diaries, all the other Paranormal Activity movies — it has never been replicated and probably never will be. The Blair Witch Project isn’t going to hold up as well for everyone. We’ve come to the point in horror that our senses need to be assaulted for us to feel anything. Turn off all the lights, close the blinds, turn off your phone and tell me that the experience of watching it isn’t terrifying. I dare you. Hey, I'm Karl, founder and film critic at Smash Cut. I started Smash Cut in 2014 to share my love of movies and give a perspective I haven't yet seen represented. I'm also an editor at The New York Times, a Rotten Tomatoes-approved critic, and a member of the Online Film Critics Society."

"Nov 18, 2018",negative,"Your friends lied to you when they said you needed to watch this film once before you die. Considered a horror classic, but this found footage movie has been severely overhyped."
"Nov 10, 2018",positive,"There was a considerable number of people who went to go see The Blair Witch Project believing it was a documentary. That's how uncommercialized found footage was as a conceit, and how elegantly crafted this movie is."
"Nov 10, 2018",positive," Review: One of my few concessions to Halloween is to ramp up my horror movie watching in the days before October 31st, and the chance to watch one of the most fabled spookers of all time (and originator of the ‘found footage’ subgenre) proved too good to pass up. So, with over 15 years’ perspective, just how good is The Blair Witch Project away from the sheer hype it generated on its release? It’s become fashionable to scoff at the film in recent years, but in my opinion it stands the test of time. Its ‘found footage’ gimmick still hooks despite the conceit being flogged to death by subsequent copycat filmmakers, and other, less obvious elements conspire to make it a deceptively rich film. First, it’s a very ambitious and cine-literate work by directors Eduardo Sánchez and Daniel Myrick. They understand the lure of legend and storytelling to the horror genre, and they cleverly choose to wrap the film up in various Russian Doll layers: there’s the general ‘Blair Witch’ myth, then the documentary filmmakers shooting a pilot treatment about the cult of that story, then there’s what actually happens to the filmmakers as ‘strange things’ start occurring in the woods, before the final layer of reception – that we’re being told this is ‘found footage’, so we know from the outset that the filmmakers didn’t survive."
"Dec 13, 2014",positive,"The scariest shots, from someone's little Hi-8 camcorder, document the students losing their bearings, giving way to panic and finally falling victim, though off screen, to some ineffably, unphotographably evil presence."
"Sep 29, 2014",positive," (CNN) -- Is there really any reason to point it out these days when a film has been over-hyped?  Or, more precisely, does over-hype still exist?  It's become the movie industry standard to make sure that every man, woman, child, and pet on the planet is salivating over each new release, and 24-hour information-spewers like cable TV and the Internet will see to it from here on out that that'll never change. Even by today's bloated standards, though, Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez's sometimes blindingly frightful homemade horror movie, ""The Blair Witch Project,"" is a special case.  Due to advance raves from the Sundance Film Festival -- and a well-designed Web site that adds considerably to the movie's creepy mystique -- ""Blair Witch"" garnered a sizable cult following far in advance of it actually opening. From a premature raving standpoint, it's ""Eyes Wide Shut"" minus the huge budget, big stars, fancy lighting, elegant camera work, and Stanley Kubrick.  Audiences (and a great many critics) will be jumping up and down about the whole thing, even though it only contains about 30 minutes of honestly laudable footage.  They are, however, a superb, absolutely terrifying 30 minutes. This is a mock documentary to some degree, but its raw, hand-held look doesn't allow even that much formality.  The premise is that on October 21, 1994, three student filmmakers (well played by Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Michael C. Williams) headed off to the hills of Maryland to make a documentary about the possibly imaginary Blair Witch, who may or may not have been responsible for a handful of grisly deaths over the years. Unfortunately, the filmmakers never came back.  A year later, their footage was somehow discovered, and what we're looking at is the unnerving, altogether mystifying evidence of what happened to them. Nearly all of ""The Blair Witch Project"" is improvised.  Myrick and Sanchez's truly inspired approach to the film was to let their cast wander the woods for several days with a tape recorder, 16-millimeter camera, and home video camera in tow, documenting the distant noises and disturbing warning signs that their ""directors"" were leaving for them in the cover of darkness. Then, hours of evidently rambling footage was edited down to one little movie that's designed to slowly build on you like a nervous breakdown.  Peppered throughout are supremely disquieting set pieces that (sometimes literally) shout: ""What the hell is that?!!"" Before we get to the good stuff, though, we have to deal with the movie's huge, nearly crippling problem.  It pains me to do so, because the successful sequences are so resoundingly successful.  However, it must be noted that if you haven't had a couple cups of coffee before sinking down in your seat, you may find yourself unexpectedly watching ""The Blair Insomnia Project.""  The level of repetition when the students lose their way is disconcerting for a while, just as the directors intended it to be.  But any semblance of drive is soon dumped in favor of a meandering ""realism"" that's normally cut out of other films, for very good reasons. Myrick and Sanchez are obviously struggling so hard to stretch this baby out to even 82 minutes, you find yourself rooting for the witch after a while.  You can't really say that there's character development in the conventional sense, but you do get to see the close-knit group disintegrating before your eyes.  In real time.  To a large degree, the movie is about the horror of group dynamics. Donahue's character is the director of the ""documentary,"" and she endlessly badgers her slacker companions to get this shot, get that shot, cross the stream, keep the camera rolling, etc.  She's like the straight-A student bossing everyone around behind the counter at McDonald's. She turns out to be the one who's most responsible for their predicament (her map-reading skills leave a lot to be desired) and, when her friends finally lose it and try to belt her in the side of the head, you can't help but feel a secret thrill.  It's just that it takes them so long to get to that point, you'll probably want to belt the projectionist first.  It really becomes trying after about 40 minutes, and you've got a long way to go from there. But let's talk about the soon-to-be-legendary scares.  Whenever night falls, the movie takes off, but in a slow creep, with all your childhood fears of the dark suddenly revealing themselves as absolutely reasonable. Since the weak-registering video camera is the main source of recording the events, many of the most frightening sequences play themselves out on a virtually black screen.  It's bad enough when the students climb into their tent for the night and start hearing strange, unexplained popping sounds surrounding them in the distance, but the moment when a crying baby echoes through the darkness is wildly terrifying. And Donahue's piercing, almost animal-like screams as the trio runs through the woods, not knowing who or what they're running from, or where to go next, will stick with you forever.  (Honest to God, I just got goose bumps thinking about it.) Not to give anything away (the movie is so vague about what's happening, that's almost impossible), but the final sequence is the stuff of sheer, unadulterated nightmares.  The images themselves, with the video camera's light dimly sweeping across things that you're certain you don't want to see, are hellish.  It really looks like the moment when you force yourself to wake up, not wanting to proceed a step further into the ravings of your sleeping imagination.  It takes a long time getting there, but the film's pay-off is all the more powerful for being a lonely, dull thud.  It's just you and your worst fears, battling to the death. ""The Blair Witch Project"" is scary because it doesn't really show you anything ... a lesson that other horror directors would be well-served to learn.  There's only a brief moment when you see blood, but it registers like a howitzer. For the most part, the soundtrack is what does it to you.  If you like to camp out but still get a little creeped by unexplained noises, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE.  (There's also a ton of ""F"" words, which is understandable given the characters' predicament.)  Rated R.  82 padded minutes."

What we see couldn't be much simpler. Exposition is dispensed with through some talking-head interviews with townies in the nearby village of Burkittsville, through which we learn of the belief that the forest is haunted by a witch from the 1700s, and that it has been the site of child murders and other grisly business ever since. Undaunted, the trio heads blithely off into the woods on their camping trip/movie shoot.

They find and film little piles of rocks on the ground and pagan-looking human effigies hanging from the trees. They hear creepy sounds outside the tent at night. By the third day, the guys are on the verge of panic, but the woman, who's the director of the project, remains chipper and breezily unconcerned, even after it finally becomes clear that they're lost in the woods. From there, the excursion quickly grows less and less agreeable.

The Cowardly Lion had the right idea. Entering a haunted forest in search of a witch, the noble beast kept repeating, ""I do believe in spooks, I do believe in spooks, I do, I do, I do."" He seemed to instinctively understand that, at least in the movies, believing in the supernatural is the best defense against its nasty surprises. ""Spooks"" tend to get offended when you don't believe in them, especially when you're on their turf.

""It's very difficult to get lost in America,"" Heather assures her companions, trying to buck them up. This misconception — that the country has been tamed, that there's sure to be a 7-Eleven or a McDonald's just over the next ridge — gets quite a workout in The Blair Witch Project. The subtext is how much modern rationalism has to do with the sense of security that we get from social and technological comforts, and how quickly rationalism can desert us when they're taken away.

The surprise is that, within its narrow presentational conceit, the film manages some real emotional depth and subtlety, and some pretty trenchant observations on the humbling power of nature and, maybe, of supernature. The director continues, much to the fury of her colleagues, to obsessively videotape their adventure, in spite of the dire situation they're in. But when one of the guys picks up the camera and shoots a few scenes, he says, ""I see why you like this camera so much — because it's not quite reality.""

Later they berate her because, even at their most desperate, ""She's still makin' movies."" ""It's all I have left,"" she blurts out. Whether this was scripted or just an inspired ad lib, it's this idea that makes The Blair Witch Project credible — the footage is shot because the characters cling to their cameras like technological security blankets.

The Blair Witch Project manifests very little of its effect through visual ghastliness. Almost all of the terror is achieved through sound, through the dread-soaked atmosphere of the October woods — which, except for a dead mouse, seem to be free of animals and birds — and through the utterly convincing reactions of the actors. As such, the film is a reproach to the notion that in this era of gore, it's no longer possible to scare an audience with suspense and suggestion.

The two most noted horror pictures of the decade so far, Scream and its superior sequel Scream 2, were both entertaining enough. But when a genre reaches the point where it's alternating routine slasher shocks with jaded jokes about the hokiness of the form to which it's adhering, that genre is crying out to be reinvented.

Myrick and Sanchez heard the cry. Like George Romero and Tobe Hooper, they simply took their cameras into the woods and, unaided by prosthetic effects or campy in-jokes, figured out a new way to scare the bejesus out of us. Their technique is one that has rarely been attempted in the horror field: naturalistic verisimilitude. It's clear that the actors, who shot the film themselves while improvising the dialogue along a scenario preplanned by the directors, were immersed in the situation to the point that their terrified reactions can't even properly be called acting.

The result of this method is so believable that the audience is put in something like the same position — it's only by context that we know we aren't looking at real document. Nothing about The Blair Witch Project allows us to say, ""It's only a movie,"" apart from our knowledge that it's only a movie.

And some audience members may even be unwilling to credit this knowledge. It wouldn't surprise me at all if The Blair Witch Project became the subject of its own urban legend. Leaving the theater after the screening I attended, I heard a young man ask the publicist, ""So, is this real?"" One of his companions pointed out, ""No, didn't you see? It had that ""All characters and events are fictitious' thing in the credits.""

""Yeah,"" he said, ""but don't they have to put that on, for legal reasons?""

I loved this gullible viewer's yearning to believe in the veracity of what he had just seen, terrifying though it was — his yearning for something beyond rationalism to believe in, for a less mundane, more magical world, for an American forest in which it's still possible to get cosmically lost. The Cowardly Lion had the right idea, and so did this guy.

I loved this gullible viewer's yearning to believe in the veracity of what he had just seen, terrifying though it was — his yearning for something beyond rationalism to believe in, for a less mundane, more magical world, for an American forest in which it's still possible to get cosmically lost.

And some audience members may even be unwilling to credit this knowledge. It wouldn't surprise me at all if The Blair Witch Project became the subject of its own urban legend. Leaving the theater after the screening I attended, I heard a young man ask the publicist, ""So, is this real?"" One of his companions pointed out, ""No, didn't you see? It had that ""All characters and events are fictitious' thing in the credits.""

""Yeah,"" he said, ""but don't they have to put that on, for legal reasons?""

"Oct 5, 2013",neutral," CABARET BALKAN (R) Director: Goran Paskaljevic. With Lazar RistoSki, Miki Manojlovic, Mirjana Jokovic, Sergej Trifunovic. (100 min.) +++ Personal conflict interacts with political despair to produce an explosive atmosphere in this many-layered Yugoslavian drama, set in Belgrade during the mid-1990s. The multiple story lines often seem more melodramatic than enlightening, but they provide a harrowing look at a country on the brink of tumultuous events. Also known as ""The Powder Keg."" In Serbo-Croatian with subtitles. HAROLD AND MAUDE (Not rated) Director: Hal Ashby. With Bud Cort, Ruth Gordon, Vivian Pickles, Cyril Cusack. (90 min.) +++ Reissue of the 1972 cult favorite about a suicidal young man who falls madly in love with an elderly woman. The comedy's reputation is greater than its achievements, but it provides a pungent example of the do-your-own-thing philosophy that motivated movies like this in the adventurous era of the late &amp;#8217;60s and early &amp;#8217;70s. THE HAUNTING (PG-13) Director: Jan De Bont. With Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Lili Taylor, Owen Wilson, Marian Seldes. (117 min.) ++ A psychologist brings three recruits to a spooky old house, where he hopes to study their reactions under fear-inducing conditions. The haunted mansion is more interesting to watch than the Hollywood-style shocks that unfold there. The jolts are inspired less by Shirley Jackson's nuanced 1959 novel than by the high-tech fantasies of the computer-imaging department at DreamWorks, which made the picture. MY LIFE SO FAR (PG-13) Director: Hugh Hudson. With Colin Firth, Irene Jacob, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Malcolm McDowell, Tcheky Karyo, Rosemary Harris, Robert Norman, Kelly MacDonald. (93 min.) ++ The adventures of a 10-year-old boy growing up on a peaceful Scottish estate surrounded by a not-so-peaceful family, including a matriarchal grandmother, a headstrong uncle, and a father who's half genius and half screwball. The story falls into many familiar formulas, but solid performances keep it reasonably entertaining. ROSIE (R) Director: Patrice Toye. With Aranka Coppens, Joost Wijnant, Sara de Roo, Dirk Roofthooft, Frank Vercruyssen. (93 min.) +++ The title character is a 13-year-old girl whose 27-year-old mother is trying to raise her right, but keeps running into emotional and psychological problems she doesn't know how to solve. Sensitive acting and skillful directing make the drama quietly touching despite some harrowing moments, and it's refreshing to see a movie from the Flemish-speaking part of Belgium, which exports fewer movies to the overseas market than its French-speaking counterpart does. In Flemish with English subtitles. AMERICAN PIE (R) Director: Paul Weitz. With Jason Biggs, Natasha Lyonne, Chris Klein, Shannon Elizabeth, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Alyson Hannigan, Tara Reid, Seann W. Scott, Mena Suvari, Eddie Kaye Thomas, Eugene Levy. (100 min.) + A bunch of high-school boys make a vow to consummate their sex lives before graduation, and pursue various girls with this project in mind. Teenybopper comedies rarely reach heights of inspiration, and this one is mostly unappealing despite a handful of amusing performances. Contains a high degree of gross-out humor. Sex/Nudity: 78 instances of graphic sexual innuendo and activity, 11 instances with partial and/or complete nudity. Violence: 2 scenes involving fistfights. Profanity: 62 expressions. Drugs: 29 instances of drinking. AN IDEAL HUSBAND (PG-13) Director: Oliver Parker. With Jeremy Northam, Julianne Moore, Rupert Everett, Cate Blanchett, John Wood, Minnie Driver, Peter Vaughan, Jeroen Krabb. (97 min.) +++ Oscar Wilde&amp;#8217;s play inspired this supple comedy, centering on a well- starched British gentleman who&amp;#8217;s hiding a secret that could touch off a political scandal if a beautiful blackmailer doesn&amp;#8217;t get what she wants. The dialogue is witty, the cast is appealing, and modern-day moviegoers will spot more than a few parallels between their morally checkered age and London of a century ago. +++1/2 Sparkling comedy, fun plot twists, intelligent, charming, witty. Sex/Nudity: Fleeting nudity, mild innuendo, 1 instance of implied sex. Violence: None. Profanity: 7 mild expressions. Drugs: 9 scenes with drinking and/or smoking. ARLINGTON ROAD (R) Director: Mark Pellington. With Jeff Bridges, Tim Robbins, Joan Cusack, Hope Davis. (117 min.) +++ A widowed college teacher gets the idea that his clean-living suburban neighbors may be involved in a terrorist plot. The story is vivid, involving, and thought-provoking, and Pellington keeps it moving at such a steady clip that you almost don't notice when Ehren Kruger's screenplay makes an occasional lapse into far-fetched coincidence. Be warned that this Hitchcockian thriller pursues its ideas to grim and unsettling conclusions. ++ Forgettable, painfully slow-paced, edgy, implausible. Sex/Nudity: 1 mildly compromising scene. Violence: 5 scenes including kidnapping, a fistfight, and guns. Profanity: 19 expressions, mostly mild. Drugs: 6 scenes with alcohol, 2 with cigarettes. THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT (R) Directors: Eduardo Sanchez, Daniel Myrick. With Heather Donahue, Michael Williams, Joshua Leonard. (87 min.) ++ The premise behind this offbeat picture is that three film students disappeared after trekking into a supposedly haunted forest, and we&amp;#8217;re watching the film and video they shot before meeting their mysterious fate. The concept is clever, suggesting a new way to build horror-movie suspense without much on- camera gore. The movie would be better as a 30-minute short, though, since its shaky camera work and fuzzy images get monotonous after a while, and there's not much room for character development within the very limited plot. THE DINNER GAME (Not rated) Director: Francis Veber. With Thierry Lhermitte, Jacques Villeret, Francis Huster, Daniel Prevost, Alexandra Vendernoot, Catherine Frot. (82 min.) +++ Playing an obnoxious game he enjoys, a publisher invites an eccentric man to dinner so he and his friends can mock him, but the unsuspecting guest proves to be more solid and sensitive than anyone else around. France invented this sort of crackling farce, and the tradition remains alive and well in Veber's able hands. In French with English subtitles. EYES WIDE SHUT (R) Director: Stanley Kubrick. With Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Sydney Pollack, Marie Richardson, Leelee Sobieski, Rade Sherbedgia. (159 min.) +++ After his wife confesses to having sexual fantasies, a successful physician drifts into unexpected events that lead him to a mysterious mansion full of illicit activities and what might be deadly dangers. Brilliantly filmed in his usual transfixing style, Kubrick&amp;#8217;s last movie pleads for alertness to the temptations that assail human nature from within and without. It&amp;#8217;s weighed down by wordy dialogue and a slowly paced story, though. Written by Kubrick and Frederick Raphael, it&amp;#8217;s based on an Arthur Schnitzler novella. Contains explicit sex, nudity, and drug use. +++ Deviant, slow, richly layered, graphic, sensual, exquisite camera work. Sex/Nudity: 17 instances with 7 scenes of full frontal and/or partial nudity, 1 graphic orgy scene, propositioning, and implied child sex. Violence: 2 instances of mild violence, one implied. Profanity: 35 expressions, mostly harsh. Drugs: 4 scenes with social drinking, 1 with marijuana, 1 death by overdose. LAKE PLACID (R) Director: Steve Miner. With Bridget Fonda, Oliver Platt, Bill Pullman, Brendan Gleeson. (88 min.) + Placid lake, giant crocodile, chomp chomp. Stay away unless you enjoy gross- out violence, and stay even farther away if you're an animal lover, since some of the most grisly attacks are aimed at cows who just want to chew their cuds in peace. What&amp;#8217;s a good cast doing in a clunky horror-spoof like this? u1/2 Gory, mediocre, short. Sex/Nudity: None. Violence: 11 scenes, most with a hungry crocodile. Profanity: 41 expressions, some harsh. Drugs: None. MUPPETS FROM SPACE (G) Director: Tim Hill. With Muppet performers and Ray Liotta, David Arquette, Jeffrey Tambor, Andie MacDowell, F. Murray Abraham, Pat Hingle. (82 min.) ++ Gonzo always knew he was unique, and now he learns why: His family is from outer space, and a reunion is long overdue. Muppet fans will enjoy the antics of Miss Piggy and her friends, but others may find the action less sprightly and funny than it tries to be. +++ Boisterous, nutty, good clean fun. Sex/Nudity/Profanity: None. Violence: 9 slapstick scenes, including electrocutions, a Miss Piggy karate fight, and the sound of a lawn mower hitting a cat. Drugs: 1 scene with cigarette smoking. RUN LOLA RUN (R) Director: Tom Tykwer. With Franka Potente, Moritz Bleibtreu, Nina Petri, Herbert Knaup, Armin Rohde. (81 min.) ++++ Amazingly creative filmmaking propels this anything-goes tale of a young woman who has just 20 minutes to save her boyfriend&amp;#8217;s life by raising a huge amount of cash. Tykwer&amp;#8217;s style gives the movie an explosive energy that never quits, marking him as the most ingenious new talent to hail from Germany in ages. Contains violent action. In German with English subtitles. ++++ Nonstop, full of surprises, fun, philosophical. Sex/Nudity: 1 very brief scene. Violence: 9 scenes with gunshots, mugging, car crashes followed by threats of violence. Profanity: 18 harsh expressions. Drugs: 1 drug deal, 2 scenes with smoking, 4 with drinking. SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER &amp; UNCUT (R) Director: Trey Parker. With voices of Trey Parker, Matt Stone, George Clooney, Brent Spiner, Minnie Driver. (80 min.) ++ A bunch of third-graders sneak into an adults-only movie that teaches them even more obscenities than they already know, touching off a visit to Hades and a war with Canada, among other adventures. Based on the TV cartoon series with a knack for titillating youngsters and irritating parents, the comedy labors mightily to be as offensive and obnoxious as possible. It&amp;#8217;s inventive in an idiotic sort of way, though, and pauses occasionally to make serious points about movie violence and censorship. Contains extremely foul sexual and scatological humor. + Offensive, vulgar, pointless, irreverent. Sex/Nudity: 1 scene with nudity, and 17 instances of innuendo. Violence: 3 scenes with blood including gory cartoon violence in a war. Profanity: At least 300 expressions, often harsh. Drugs: 3 scenes with smoking. DOWN IN THE DELTA (PG-13) Director: Maya Angelou. With Alfre Woodard, Mary Alice, Wesley Snipes, Esther Rolle. (110 min.) +++ Long celebrated as a poet, Angelou makes her movie-directing debut with this engaging story of an African-American woman who takes her drug-abusing daughter and endangered grandchildren from Chicago to Mississippi. +++ Uplifting, raw, life-affirming. OCTOBER SKY (PG) Director: Joe Johnston. With Jake Gyllenhaal, Chris Cooper, Chris Owen, Laura Dern. (105 min.) +++ The real-life career of scientist Homer Hickam inspired this good-natured tale of a 1950s teenager who resists the destiny his West Virginia family has mapped out for him. The movie is more likable than believable, but it recaptures the mystique of rocket science. +++1/2 Family fare, good message, sappy. PAYBACK (R) Director: Brian Helgeland. With Mel Gibson, Deborah Kara Unger, James Coburn. (105 min.) + An interesting cast is wasted in this misanthropic thriller about a criminal bent on revenge against his ex-wife and former partner. Mayhem is expected, but the filmmakers add torture into the bargain, and it&amp;#8217;s hard to remember a mainstream movie that aims so much violence at female characters. ++ Lots of attitude, energetic, cold-blooded."

"Oct 5, 2013",positive," Movie review XXX ""The Blair Witch Project,"" with Heather Donahue, Michael Williams, Joshua Leonard, Bob Griffith, Jim King. Directed and written by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez. 87 minutes. Neptune. ""R"" - Restricted because of language. Well, yes. But it's an awfully ingenious fake: a ""documentary"" that doubles as a horror film, as three young filmmakers head off to Maryland's Black Hills Forest to investigate a local legend about a demonic apparition. We're told at the outset that they disappeared in 1994, leaving only this haunting footage of their experiences. Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, the co-directors of this elaborate hoax, took the audience by surprise at the Sundance Film Festival last January, when many reportedly bought the premise and swallowed the story whole. Even at Seattle test screenings a few weeks ago, audiences were still spooked. But Myrick and Sanchez may have outwitted themselves by creating such a well-oiled promotional machine that the movie's big secret can no longer be kept. Earlier this week, they probably compounded their problems by presenting an hour-long television special, ""Curse of the Blair Witch,"" that also presented this whopper with a straight face. It may have been too much. ""The result is a mind game made by skilled hands,"" wrote Laura Fries in Variety. ""Sanchez and company have broken the rules with this TV special and with their movie, but to give away too much would spoil the fun."" Some of the fun may already be spoiled, as that heckler demonstrated. There's evidently a Blair Witch Backlash movement that sees the picture as little more than self-induced hysteria. In a sense they're right, but isn't that what all horror movies are? As a piece of filmmaking, ""The Blair Witch Project"" deserves respect. Using the most modest means, Sanchez and Myrick manage to tell a compelling story, create recognizable characters and hold our attention even when there's literally nothing on the screen. Parts of the picture resemble a radio play that's designed to raise goose pimples. Effective as the hand-held camera work often is, it's the soundtrack (and the conviction of the actors) that truly distinguishes this film. We can't help wondering, along with the ""doomed"" filmmakers huddled inside their tent, who's out there, apparently stalking them. Heather Donahue makes the strongest impression as the documentary's take-charge director, who keeps shooting footage even when her sound man (Michael Williams) and her cameraman (Joshua Leonard) think they have other priorities. Utterly lost in the woods, they scream insults at each other, blame each other for their predicament, and begin to feel that they're really in danger. At first the arguments are petty and amusing (one debate involves memories of ""Gilligan's Island""). But then their fears appear to be confirmed by sightings of peculiar twig formations and organized rock piles, and by sinister noises in the night. It all ends badly, though not quite in the way you'd expect. The final images are so chaotic and inexplicable that you find yourself trying to piece together the end of the story, as you would if you really did find such footage. This is calculated, manipulative low-budget filmmaking at its most creative."
"Oct 9, 2012",positive,This terrifying ghost story is guaranteed to haunt filmgoers long after they've persuaded themselves that it's only a movie.
"Oct 9, 2012",positive," The Horror! The  Horror! It’s everywhere this summer. Look at the fear on the face of gorgeous Catherine Zeta-Jones in The Haunting, a $75 million scarefest from Twister director Jan De Bont in which Zeta-Jones’ lesbian designs on Lili Taylor pale next to the hideous designs that a haunted New England mansion has on both of them. Or check out The Deep Blue Sea, with Cliff-hanger director Renny Harlin pulling every trick an $80 million budget can buy to put Samuel L. Jackson, Thomas Jane and Saffron Burrows at the mercy of merciless, supersize sharks. Screenwriter David E. Kelley (Ally McBeal, The Practice) seasons the gore with giggles in Lake Placid, featuring Bridget Fonda and a scene-stealing Brendan Gleeson out to stop a huge crocodile from bloodying a lake in Maine. It’s a lake-front Anaconda, in which Jon Voight became the first Oscar winner to be swallowed by a jumbo snake. That’s right: Lake Placid is the usual cheese passing for quality in a genre that has long since replaced inspiration with digital monsters, costly effects and fresh ways to splatter blood. Help is on the way. I have seen the new face of movie horror and its name is The Blair Witch Project, a groundbreaker in fright that reinvents scary for the new millennium. Better yet, it does the job without guns or a glimpse of a naked, screaming coed and with a budget ($75,000) that couldn’t buy George Lucas a proper car. It’s what you don’t see in The Blair Witch Project that pumps your adrenalin and, in the best Hitchcock tradition, keeps you hanging on. In October of 1994, three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland, while shooting a documentary. A year later, their footage was found. It’s that edited footage of their five days in the woods that we watch for the next eighty-seven minutes of sweaty palms and rabid anticipation. Heather Donahue, carrying a High 8 color video camcorder and a list of questions, is the leader of the crew, which includes soundman Michael Williams and camera operator Joshua Leonard, who shoots on 16 mm black-and-white film. The trio hikes into Maryland’s Black Hills Forest, a two-hour drive in Josh’s car from Washington, D.C. The purpose is to investigate a local legend, begun in 1785, about an alleged witch named Elly Kedward who was banished from the area (then called Blair) for luring children into her home to draw their blood. A year later, the town’s children mysteriously vanished, and the Blair Witch cult grew. Over time, others are reported missing, and in 1886, disemboweled bodies are found at Coffin Rock, along with oily bundles of sticks. Heather interviews Mary Brown, a disoriented resident of the area, who claims to have seen the witch, a hairy blend of human and beast, near Tap-py Creek. When two fishermen claim that the area can be reached by an old logging trail, Heather, Joshua and Michael begin their journey into the heart of darkness. Things start well enough, until Heather gets the crew lost and the guys curse her out for having them walking in circles. In their tents, they start hearing strange sounds outside, like twigs being stepped on. At daylight, they discover bundles of sticks and a burial ground. The cameras, which can’t capture the thing or things that go bump in the night, produce increasingly shaky images that reflect the nerves of the crew. No fair to reveal more or to reflect on the ambiguous ending, which will have you arguing for days. Tension mounts as Heather, Joshua and Michael lose their psychological bearings, rage at each other and tempt fate in a deserted cabin that fully defines Heather’s fear when she says, “I’m scared to close my eyes and I’m scared to open them.” Stop reading now if you don’t want to know the tricks that make The Blair Witch Project such a terror treat. Or maybe you’ve already surmised that the movie is a devilishly clever scam. For starters, the story isn’t true. It was dreamed up by Eduardo Sanchez, 30, and Daniel Myrick, 35 — friends from the University of Central Florida Film School — who also directed and edited the movie. Along with three other UCF alumni — producers Gregg Hale and Robin Cowie, and co-producer Michael Monello — they hired three unknown actors who were skilled at improvisation. That’s because the actors were sent into the Maryland woods with only the barest bones of a story and asked to make up the dialogue as they went along. Sanchez and Myrick also taught them how to operate the camera and sound equipment. That handheld, home-movie feel is for real. So are the rattled looks on the actors’ faces. The directors took their cue from producer Hale’s Army training and shot the film like a military exercise. There was little contact with the actors, who were deprived of sleep and sometimes food rations in the name of authenticity. It’s doubtful even Titanic dictator James Cameron would torture actors to that extent. Still, there’s no doubting the payoff. Sanchez and Myrick have made a sly virtue of limited resources and made a film that will creep you out of your skin. Who says imagination isn’t rewarded in Hollywood? The filmmakers sold their chicken-feed-financed debut feature to Artisan Entertainment for a way-cool $1.5 million, won raves at film festivals from Sundance to Cannes and spawned a mini Blair Witch industry that includes a novelization, a comic book, a soundtrack CD, a Sci-Fi Channel special and — yikes — a Web site (blairwitch.com). And guess what? The movie is so good that you don’t for a second hate them for it."

"Jun 18, 2012",positive," Titles inform us that the footage we are about to see was shot by three student film-makers who went into the woods surrounding the town of Burkittsville, Maryland, and were never heard from again. The footage was discovered by a search party a year later. Burkittsville, 1994. Heather, a director, Josh, a cameraman, and Mike, a soundman, head for the woods to investigate the local legend of the Blair Witch, a spirit blamed for various disappearances and the murders of several children many years before. After stocking up on provisions for a three-day trip and interviewing locals for their stories about the Blair Witch, the three set out. Things immediately start to unravel. The map Heather relies on leads the three in circles, and her insistence on filming everything, including the trio's arguments, exacerbates the tension. Soon they're awoken in the middle of the night by the sounds of children screaming. Strange piles of rocks and stick figures made out of branches are left outside their tent.  Shortly after Josh finds his belongings strewn over their campsite, he disappears. A few days later Heather finds a bundle made of torn strips of Josh's shirt with an unidentified piece of bloody viscera inside. With food and hope gone, Heather and Mike stumble on a house in the woods... Glee is understandable when a small-budget ($25,000) independent film not only rivals Hollywood's summer blockbusters at the box office (The Blair Witch Project has taken more than $100 million and counting) but also captures the public's imagination in a way no Hollywood release of the season has managed. There's some poetic justice in the idea that a film made by unknowns and shot on video with no stars and no special effects could trounce its prepackaged competition. The ways 'entertainment reporting' has elevated the business side of movies over discussion of their quality have resulted in moviegoers who are cynically knowing about deals and grosses but conditioned to accept the junk shovelled at them. So it's not surprising that audiences respond to the zero-style of Blair Witch. With special effects announcing nothing so much as their own price tag, this picture's flat replication of reality, achieved using handheld video, and its ability to scare audiences witless with nothing more than shots of rocks and twigs are genuinely jolting. Because the film is so deliberately lacking in 'art' in much the same way Night of the Living Dead (1968) was, you can be lulled into thinking what you're seeing is actually happening. But as the megalomaniacal director played by Peter O'Toole in The Stunt Man (1979) asked, ""How tall is King Kong?"" Don't Myrick and Sanchez know that movies are fake? Apart from the sadism of keeping your (non-union) cast hungry, cold and terrified for a week, there's the question of why you hire actors if you don't trust them to act? Certainly the unmediated hysteria we see the actors sliding into is part of what makes the film so terrifying. It's also what makes it so unpleasant. The method makes nonsense of the implied criticism of Heather's inability to put down her camera and deal with the reality in front of her. How can you take that criticism seriously from a film designed to eke every ounce of real misery and terror from its cast? Myrick and Sanchez's method may be the opposite of Hollywood's, but by banishing psychology, characterisation and finally humanity from their film, by excluding anything but sensation, the effect is ultimately not that much different from that of, say, Armageddon. The most persistent Blair Witch myth is that the film eschewed the usual methods of marketing. In fact, no film in recent memory has been as shrewdly pre-sold as this one. The buzz it generated at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year was sustained via a website, an hour-long 'documentary' on the history of the Blair Witch (shown on US primetime television three nights before the film opened) and pre-release displays of ""artefacts"" in the lobbies of theatres. Currently you can purchase a Blair Witch comic, a film companion book, t-shirts and a soundtrack. Now comes word that a sequel is on the way. The most amusing thing about Hollywood's hottest new 'directors' is that they haven't actually directed anything. The producer who takes credit while doing no work has long been a staple of Hollywood satire. Myrick and Sanchez have gone that stock figure one better, as they told one interviewer, sitting in a burger joint laughing about the actors - hungry, cold and scared in the woods - who shot the movie Myrick and Sanchez have taken credit for. Somewhere, P. T. Barnum is smiling. "

"Oct 18, 2008",positive," One of the most difficult genres to do and do well is horror. For years slasher films have dominated the landscape and outside of the originals, “Friday the 13th” and “A Nightmare on Elm Street,” they haven’t been very good. Then came “Scream” which redefined horror by spoofing it, but never really succeeded at capturing the true nature of horror by tapping into the human emotion of fear. Now we have a new brand of horror to admire. The horror we do not see. No underscore, no gore, just plain fear of the unknown. Three film students decide to make a documentary about a legend called the Blair Witch. Their journey begins innocently enough. They interview several townsfolk at their destination about what they’ve heard on the subject. One mother, holding a child, explains what she knows while her child occasionally covers her mouth so that perhaps she can’t speak of the witch. The mother honestly believes it, but refuses to admit that it could be real to her child. Another of their interviewees is a strange woman who bears the stereotypical witch look. They also speak with some fishermen on their way out to their shooting location. One fisherman thinks the legend is real while the other thinks it’s not. They eventually start hiking to the forest to reach their first shoot and take several hours to get there. They film what they can and then set up camp for the night. They proceed from there on the second day, get even more footage and camp one more time. That night, they hear noises in the forest. They get out their equipment and capture what they can, but can’t figure out where it’s coming from. The next day, it’s time for them to go home, but Heather (Heather Donahue) decides she wants to investigate a little further and ends up angering her cohorts when they come across a sanctuary of sticks bundled into human shapes dangling from various trees. Heather wants to capture as much as she can, but neither Josh (Joshua Leonard) nor Mike (Michael C. Williams) have any further interest in the subject. They’re ready to go and want to get out as soon as possible. They finally talk Heather into going, but can’t seem to find their car. They camp one more night and are again awoken by things that go “screech” in the night. The next day they try again, but to no avail and when they try to check the map, they find it is missing. Among the frightening things they find are piles of rocks similar to ones they had found earlier in a somewhat ritualistic area. They only fear the worst, which heightens their paranoia. By the time the film reaches its disturbing climax, we are no more certain of what’s making all the noise or causing all the problems than the characters themselves are. Filmed in both black-and-white on 16mm and in color on camcorder, “The Blair Witch Project” is rumored to have cost only $50,000. There are times when it feels painfully real and others where it feels a little slow. While its realism is a strong point, there are many times when certain shots or set-ups feel faked. The most impressive part of the film is when they are using both the 16mm and Camcorder, cutting back and forth without the DAT. Since 16mm cannot be shot with sound, we are forced to listen to what’s going on through the camcorder, which becomes apparent when the two are separate and they switch between each. One time in particular you are watching Heather running the 16mm while hearing her voice in the distance on the camcorder. The images are quite jarring and may cause some with motion sickness to feel ill, but are all part of the bigger experience. The performances are as close to perfect as have been seen so far this year and the film itself is well edited and written. “Blair Witch” is proof that you don’t need expensive visual effects, extravagant plots, dozens of characters or buckets of blood to make an excellent horror film. Not to be missed if you like horror films, but seeing it, you have to realize that it’s not “Armageddon,” it’s not “Scream” and it’s not “Saving Private Ryan,” it’s an inexpensive film that leaves you terrified with little more than darkness, sound effects and your own imagination."

"Sep 24, 2007",positive,"  The Blair Witch Project demonstrates that there’s nothing scarier than nothing. The movie has no ghosts or witches on display, and its lone bit of gore is a piece of cloth containing a mottle of indeterminate organic material. It has no surprises, either, since you know going in that the ending won’t be happy. The movie opens with a placard declaring that three film students went into the woods near “Burkittsville, Maryland” to make a documentary and were never heard from again, and that their footage was discovered a year after their disappearance. The placard doesn’t mention who edited the footage–the ghost of Hitchcock? Cassavetes?–but that’s a minor point. I could tell you the story–give away every detail–and The Blair Witch Project would still freeze your blood. Working on a budget that’s chump change and a script that’s little more than a framework for actors’ improvisations, directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez have harnessed the most irrational fears of every human alive. They have reanimated the genre not by adding to it but subtracting from it–by cooking it down to its bare bones and then rattling those bones like fiends. The first thing they’ve done is remove the omniscient point of view. With the important exception of that opening title card, there is no larger perspective. The film students–a woman, Heather Donahue, and two men, Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard (the characters bear the actors’ names)–tote their own video and movie cameras, so that we see what they see and no more. Actually, we see even less, since we lack their peripheral vision and are cruelly limited to whatever passes through their lenses. Thanks to first-rate sound equipment, though, we hear everything they hear–especially a snapping of branches in the dark outside their tent that escalates into an omnidirectional clatter. When they yell into the darkness (“Hello?”), the darkness remains dark. A light illuminates the foreground, but the blackness beyond that pool seems, if anything, blacker. There might be no more irrationally terrifying shot in the annals of film than the one in which the camera hurtles behind Heather–a hazy white streak in the center of the screen–amid crackling sounds as she throws a look into the trees and shrieks: “What is that? What the fuck is that?” We never see what the fuck that is. If we did, some part of us would probably relax, because it would look like a special effect. But no part of us is allowed to relax. Ever.  I s The Blair Witch Project a work of “art”? Not by my definition. Art rarely tortures you so single-mindedly. After the first half-hour, in which the students interview Burkittsville residents about the history of the Blair Witch (one Elly Kedward, found guilty of sorcery in 1785 and lashed to a tree during a harsh winter), the remainder of the movie is their increasingly desperate odyssey through the woods. They trudge one way, double back, pore over maps and compasses, whine, trudge some more, come upon mysterious piles of rocks or bundled twigs, and whine even louder. The action unfolds in a season halfway between autumn and winter, and the washed-out tones suggest that the Blair Witch took the forest’s colors with her when she died. The grueling monotony is broken only at night, when the students go into their tents and the sounds come again and the very celluloid seems to shiver with cold and fear. The camera twitches incessantly: The lone stationary shot is when Heather sobs an apology to her parents for having dreamed up the project, and the way she’s framed and half-lighted she looks like Lon Chaney’s Phantom of the Opera with nostril hair. I don’t apply the adjective “visceral” casually: The shaky camera summons up our fight-or-flight responses. Leaving the screening, my wife was convinced she had food poisoning from an earlier meal; when we stopped and analyzed her symptoms, we realized that she had motion sickness. The movie had literally made her sick. The power of that can’t be slighted, however. I love horror pictures and am a tough scare, but I started having nightmares about The Blair Witch Project before I even saw it–solely on the basis of its preview. I slept even less after I did see it. When I caught an interview with the superbly nervy Heather Donahue on television, the first thing I thought was, “Thank God, she’s alive.” Then she said, “This movie must be working because people come up to me all the time and say, ‘Thank God, you’re alive.’ ” The other day an envelope arrived at my door with a bunch of sticks lashed together in the familiar form of the Blair Witch talisman. I rushed to the phone and called the movie’s publicists to make sure this was a promotional gimmick. When they said yes, I started breathing again; otherwise, I might have called the police–or an exorcist.  W hat is it about The Blair Witch Project that taps into such primal emotions? Consider its antithesis. The remake of The Haunting has the bad fortune to open in the same month, and what might have been dismissed as just a lame, overstuffed big-studio scare picture will now be held up as a counterexample. Robert Wise’s 1963 original, based on Shirley Jackson’s The Haunting of Hill House, is overrated, but it manages to evoke the eeriest aspect of Jackson’s fiction: the way the characters’ neuroses acquire an inexorable life of their own and threaten to eat them alive. Nothing much happens in the empty mansion, but when something does–for instance, a thunderous pounding on a pair of big doors, as if all the characters’ accumulated nervous energies had been focused on one spot–the movie’s reticence pays off like gangbusters (or ghostbusters). In the new version, directed by Jan De Bont (Speed, 1994; Twister, 1996), that pounding comes early and serves as an overture for a bunch of computer-generated special effects: ghosties that swirl around like Tinkerbell, statues that spring to life and grab people. Everything is exasperatingly, often laughably, overexplicit, and once a dread becomes material, a ghost story becomes a monster movie–a different, far less terrifying beast. Here are sound effects so hammy that they might have been borrowed from one of those old haunted-house party albums. Doors don’t creak, they CRRRREEEAAAKKK and then close with a reverberant KER-CHUNGGGGGG. From the second Liam Neeson and his subjects–Catherine Zeta-Jones, Lili Taylor, and Owen Wilson–set foot in the farcically garish Hill House, it’s clear that Something Evil is watching them: You can tell because Something Evil respires so loudly that he’s either Darth Vader or an asthmatic. By the time poor Taylor stands up to the big, bad ghost on behalf of a lot of little, good ghosts, people in the audience are holding onto their stomachs to keep from retching with laughter. Writing, directing, acting–this is one of the most maladroit ghost movies ever made. But even if the script weren’t so tin-eared and the direction so clunky, The Haunting still wouldn’t come within screaming distance of The Blair Witch Project. The reason is philosophical. De Bont, a lavish materialist who thinks that movies can do anything if you throw enough money around, wants to scare you by showing you stuff. Myrick and Sanchez want to scare you by not showing you stuff–and by reminding you how much you can’t see and will never know. With all those cameras onscreen, they’ve liberated horror from the realm of movies–from the realm of the light–and nestled it back into the dark where it was born."
"Sep 24, 2007",negative,The viewer never glimpses anything more than the shadow of a clever movie.
"Sep 24, 2007",positive,"What gives the film much of its force and its mounting sense of queasy uncertainty is its narrative method, which ensures that we know no more about the proceedings than the characters do."
"Jul 23, 2007",neutral," If Star Wars Episode I is the geek event of the summer, The Blair Witch Project is the hipster event — the movie you have to see, not necessarily because you want to see it, but because you want to be able to say you’ve seen it. As a lifelong horror fan, and one who so recently suffered through The Haunting, I was more than eager to subject myself to what has been described — okay, hyped — as the scariest movie since Halloween and The Exorcist. What I got instead was a neat premise (and not an original one, either), one or two mildly creepy moments, a final shot designed to send ’em out buzzing, and a whole lot of bickering in between. “In October of 1994,” reads the ad copy, “three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland, while shooting a documentary. A year later their footage was found.” The movie we are watching purports to be that footage, though I trust that by now everyone knows that it is actually a work of fiction — the work of three improvising actors entrusted with camera equipment in the woods, under the remote supervision of two directors who figured out a plausible context in which to make a feature-length film on video and 16mm. A great deal of thought went into The Blair Witch Project, and what’s most disappointing is how little of it shows up in the film itself. As the three-person documentary crew — director Heather (Heather Donahue), cameraman Josh (Joshua Leonard), and sound man Mike (Michael Williams) — stumble around the bleak Maryland woods, a sense of strangeness and dread gathers in the repetitive shots of the ugly leaves and tangled branches, which look the same from scene to scene, adding to the characters’ disorientation. They are pursuing a supernatural legend in a dead forest that looks as if it would prefer to stay dead. Blair Witch has a terrific grainy ambiance, but that’s about all it has — it’s all suggestion and no payoff, like a softcore porn video — and when the characters are lost and shrieking at each other, one’s patience begins to wear thin. An improv movie like this lives or dies on the strength of the performances, and each of the actors here has some good moments — generally when they’re quiet. Heather Donahue, for example, has been encouraged to play Heather as a shrill bitch a lot of the time, so when she’s scared shitless into guilty silence — she knows she’s largely responsible for getting the crew lost — she’s much more effective than when she’s shrieking in terror or rage. But sometimes you miss the structure that a fully scripted horror movie can offer, and the actors often aren’t up to creating their own dialogue on the fly. When the map goes missing, Josh delivers this statement: “Heather, this is so not cool. Heather, this is so not cool.” Her response: “I know, it’s not cool.” And the performers really run “fuck” into the ground; I realize that frightened, exhausted people may revert to repetitive four-letter vocabulary, but after a while it seems like a failure of imagination on the actors’ part. Conversely, the most famous scene — Heather’s anguished apology into her camera — sounds totally pre-scripted and inauthentic. (And it’s framed a little too artfully, as if Heather knew her terror-stricken half-visage would become the movie’s marketing icon.) The filmmakers go for realism whenever possible (the characters, for instance, are realistically irritating at times), which may be a mistake. Blair Witch rides bumpily on its premise that what we’re watching is real, yet since we know it’s not, all we can do is judge how well it has been faked. We become connoisseurs, not emotionally involved in the characters’ plight. The movie feels like an improvisatory exercise, not a pure shot of ungovernable horror, and its chills amount to the usual spooky omens (ooh, a bunch of sticks!!) and odd rustlings in the dead of night. It feels like the work of clever people dabbling in horror — a calling card, a riff, a watercooler topic for a few weeks after its release. Horror movies may be so cluttered and ironic now that some people may take this film’s minimalist, back-to-basics method as a form of integrity, which in a way it is. But the end result isn’t very satisfying. Most of the movie, in fact, deals with mundane fears like getting lost in the woods; the filmmakers devote more time to arguments over who lost the map than to supernatural terror. And much of it is far too high-pitched, as if foulmouthed hysteria would be enough to frighten us. Some have said that if we didn’t know Blair Witch was fake, it really would be as terrifying as many critics are claiming. But who ever thought Halloween or Night of the Living Dead were really happening? Those movies scared us because, well, they were scary, not because they were cleverly faked to seem real. Blair Witch is a labored gimmick with too much “realism” and too little inventiveness. In an early scene in 1981’s An American Werewolf in London (now there’s a great horror movie), two college students are lost on the foggy Moors, surrounded by blood-freezing growling noises; one of them clenches his teeth and says quietly, “Ah, shit, David, what is that?” That brief, understated scene does everything that this movie tries, and mostly fails, to do in 86 minutes. The Blair Witch Project may bother those who are easily freaked out, and it may dissuade a few campers, but the lofty talk in the press of its being a new horror masterpiece is nonsense. That’s a burden of hype this scrawny cinema-verité stunt can’t carry."
"Jul 14, 2007",positive,The three actors manage not only to capture some beautiful footage but also to spout believable and consistent dialog without digressing into the standard Scream pop culture references.
"Apr 27, 2007",negative," pike in a long time. Incidentally, when did “scary” become the highest commercial accolade a movie could receive? Not that The Blair Witch Project struck me as particularly scary even by infantile standards. Where is the suspense? Where is the involvement? Where is the identification? We know from a printed foreword that the three young film-makers are doomed, and by the time I got to know them a little I didn’t much care what happened to them.  In accordance with the coy nomenclature of this faux-found footage, the actors and the characters have the same first names. Thus Heather Donahue plays and is Heather, the domineering young woman director of the trio. Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard play Mike and Josh, Heather’s goofily surly helpmates. I didn’t catch what exactly the two guys did in the way of technical functions, but they never seemed too impressed with Heather’s capabilities, which makes one wonder why they trusted her to lead them into an unknown forest, all three of them carrying backpacks so heavy and bulky that Hannibal would have hesitated loading them on his elephants when he was crossing the Alps toward Rome.  Go back! I kept saying to myself. Go back! But Heather, the bitch, was in no mood to listen. She thought she knew everything. You could tell from the early on-camera interviews she arranges with a variety of local yokels. Her broadly supercilious tone makes it clear that she considers herself superior to everyone around her, and that includes Mike and Josh, whom she treats as her slow-witted slaves.  Heather’s unsympathetic smugness from the outset, strangely, is what has made the movie such a big hit with audiences and critics. I’m willing to bet anything that if the movie had been simply about three guys lost in the woods, it wouldn’t have gone anywhere critically or commercially. The antifeminist-backlash spectacle of a pushy female leading two comparatively inoffensive males to be slaughtered by persons unknown and unseen gives the audience a ready-made scapegoat for the disaster. I was struck also by the complete absence of any erotic tension or fraternal friendliness between the guys and the girl even before the three fools are frightened out of their wits by strange wooden markers and burial mounds of carefully arranged stones.  All the while I kept wondering why they started out on this silly project in the first place. Indeed, I was so detached from the mission that I began noticing things that didn’t make sense in the context of the sheer terror of the experience. Why do they keep lugging around their backpacks long after it becomes clear that they should be running for their lives? Yet the filmmakers do deserve credit for a clever image in the last 10 seconds that at least works poetically, but that is not nearly enough for all the low-budget, leave-it-to-the-audience’s-imagination pretentiousness that precedes it. I was reminded of nothing so much as the low-budget, cat-people-in-total-darkness shenanigans of producer Kirk Douglas and director Barry Sullivan in Vincente Minnelli’s The Bad and the Beautiful (1952) from a studio-savvy screenplay by Charles Schnee. Actually, Heather’s camcorder-run-amok antics makes her even more irritating to a viewer forced to look at seemingly endless dead footage of trees and shrubbery.  I must confess that from the age of 5 I cannot remember ever wanting to be scared by a movie. Moved, yes. Amused, yes. Thrilled, yes. Turned on, yes. But scared, never. These days I get my fill of fear and horror by reading the daily obituaries in The New York Times . Still, there have been a few instances of my being vicariously scared despite my well-developed distancing defenses. (It’s only a movie, Andrew.) When I saw Psycho (1960) on the first day of its theatrical release without any advance buzz or screenings, the shower scene made me scream; it confirmed for me my mother complex. How could she go that far to complicate my already messed-up sex life? As a consequence, Psycho , for all its formal perfection as an insightful work of art, has never come close to being my favorite Hitchcock film, ranking far below Vertigo (1958), Shadow of a Doubt (1943), Notorious (1946) and Rear Window (1954).  After Psycho , for me the only truly frightening premise for a horror film is to be found in Wes Craven’s A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984). Why? Because dreams are among the few things we can never control in our lives, and the idea that our dreams can invade our existence with homicidal impunity constitutes a waking nightmare.  But the spectacle of three film-student types traipsing off cluelessly into an unfamiliar forest with a reported history of gruesome violence is just plain stupid. And since you never really get to know these lambs led to slaughter, it is as if you were ghoulishly watching a horrible automobile accident from a safe vantage point. There is more than a trace of banal horror movie trickery involved in getting the audience agitated by the hysterical screaming of a female character too full of guilt and shame over her fatal incompetence for us to identify in any way with her plight. This is what I didn’t like about the climax of Henri-Georges Clouzot’s Les Diaboliques (1955), with weak-hearted Vera Clouzot screaming up a storm to cue and amplify the audience reaction.  By now the inescapable triumph of evil and just plain nastiness has become commonplace in American movies. Young people, particularly, seem to be drawn to the most mindlessly nihilistic messages in movies. I am not sure why, and I have long ago stopped worrying about it. As it is, I find The Blair Witch Project much less hateful than Arlington Road with its more expert projection of a satanically debilitating paranoia. But I don’t give The Blair Witch Project extra points for being so cheaply made. Many of my esteemed colleagues have chosen to use this unexpected money-maker as a club to beat the overpriced, overgadgety, overdigitalized, and overhyped mainstream turkeys gobbling up the multiplexes. Emotional emptiness, unfortunately, is unacceptable in a movie, whatever its budget.  Frank Oz’s Bowfinger , from a screenplay by Steve Martin, takes a stab at synergizing the talents of two of the funniest men in showbiz, but the union of Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy does not so much multiply the mirth as fractionate it, not because of any lack of chemistry between these two comic talents, but because the idea of doing a parody of today’s Hollywood movie-making is self-defeating. A more challenging trick would be to make a movie taking today’s Hollywood at all seriously.  Even so, Mr. Martin’s screenplay is surprisingly heavy-handed with the subject at hand. I say surprisingly because Mr. Martin’s previous collaborations with director Oz- Little Shop of Horrors (1986), Dirty Rotten Scoundrels (1988) , Housesitter (1992)-were subtler and sweeter comic confections than they were given credit for being at the time. Bowfinger , by contrast, though not mean-spirited, never quite achieves enough credibility to justify the strenuousness of the physical maneuvers necessary to show a movie being shot with an action star unaware that he is in the cast.  Mr. Martin as Bobby Bowfinger, down-at-the-heels producer-director of the barely breathing Bowfinger International, mostly a figment of his answering machine’s imagination, thinks he has a winner in a sci-fi aliens script written by an Iranian-American accountant, and entitled Chubby Rain since the aliens invade the earth as particularly portly raindrops. There is enough whimsy in this one conceit to sink an aircraft carrier in the Nimitz class. Every time the title is repeated in any form, the whole cast of woeful wannabes limps along behind it. her self-caricature as a Norma Desmond without the oil wells. Heather Graham as Daisy, the opportunistic small-town ingénue sleeping her way to the top, is too relentlessly one-note in her characterization. The result is painlessly disappointing, but the Republic will survive.  Karoly Makk’s The Gambler , from a screenplay by Katharine Ogden and Charles Cohen and Nick Dear, is well worth seeing for its gritty homage to both the genius and the ruinous gambling obsession of Fyodor Dostoyevsky (1821-1881). The incomparable Michael Gambon as a full-throttle Dostoyevsky is alone worth the price of admission for his projection of the author’s gift of ironic alertness to the lies his characters and acquaintances keep telling themselves. The rest is bits and pieces that are more interesting as period background than as dramatic entertainment.  Mr. Gambon is ably supported by Jodhi May as Anna Snitkina, one of Russia’s first stenographers, the author’s muse, and his final companion; Polly Walker as Polina, his ever-tormenting temptress, and Dominic West as Aleksei, the novelist’s fictional alter ego at the gambling tables. Luise Rainer, who won two consecutive Academy Awards, returns to the big screen with the juicy role of the self-destructive grandmother, and gives it all her supercharged Viennese bravura of so many decades ago.  The Gambler , like Shakespeare in Love , continues the welcome trend of honoring great cultural figures as a counterpoint to the more fashionable worship of depravity and insanity.

Par Jean-François Vandeuren

          Octobre 1994, trois étudiants en cinéma disparaissent 
          mystérieusement dans une forêt en plein coeur du Maryland 
          alors qu’ils y tournaient un documentaire sur le mythe d’une 
          sorcière qui hanterait les lieux et qui aurait été 
          à l’origine de la mort de nombreux enfants et autres individus 
          de la région dans le passé. Un an plus tard, alors que 
          l’enquête n’avait jusque là abouti à 
          rien de concret, on retrouve d’une manière tout aussi inexpliquée 
          les bandes vidéos du trio dévoilant ce qui fut fort probablement 
          les derniers jours de leur existence. Partant d’un maigre budget 
          d’environ trente milles dollars, The Blair Witch Project 
          a par la suite réussi l’exploit inusité de devenir 
          un des films les plus rentables de l’histoire en amassant des 
          sommes records en salles pour le cinéma indépendant frôlant 
          les 250 millions de dollars mondialement, soit un peu plus de 8000 fois 
          la mise initiale. Le secret d’un tel succès? Une prémisse 
          publicitaire intrigante suggérant la totale véracité 
          du spectacle, ce qui eut pour effet de confondre les sceptiques parmi 
          les spectateurs curieux arborant un franc désir d’être 
          effrayés. Mais pour être étiqueté de la sorte, 
          l’essai devait à tout le moins maitriser certains attraits 
          afin de juxtaposer adéquatement réalisme et épouvante. 
          Merci au naturel stupéfiant des principaux acteurs...et à 
          l’absence totale de mise en scène.

          Cette dernière caractéristique demeure encore aujourd’hui 
          la barrière de taille à franchir pour être en mesure 
          d’apprécier pleinement cette expérience. L’apport 
          visuel se limitant principalement à l’emploi d’une 
          caméra bon marché dirigée manuellement pour soutenir 
          la cause réaliste entraine fréquemment une instabilité 
          frénétique de l’image, ce qui en a repoussé 
          plus d’un auparavant. Par contre, en forçant le spectateur 
          à user des yeux d’un aveugle lors des hauts moments de 
          tension, l’effort vient voiler cet handicap visuel en misant sur 
          l’utilisation judicieuse du son. En ce sens, le film de Daniel 
          Myrick et Eduardo Sánchez impose sa signature sur une idée 
          de plus en plus utilisée dans le cinéma d’horreur, 
          soit la suggestion. Comme les oeuvres traditionnelles de ce genre montrant 
          pleinement d’étranges créatures et autres personnages 
          tordus ne semblent plus être aptes à effrayer un public 
          aussi vaste que par le passé, qui en a vraisemblablement vu d’autres 
          depuis le temps, certains cinéastes, comme M. Night Shyamalan 
          l'a fait par la suite avec Signs, se tournent désormais 
          vers l’exploitation de la peur face à l’inconnu et 
          l’utilisation sournoise de l’imagination de l’auditoire 
          afin de créer un climat de frayeur efficace et soutenu.

          Le présent film rejette donc tout apport musical et n’utilise 
          concrètement que l’univers ambiant comme base sonore d’arrière-plan 
          pour appuyer autant la mise en situation que les scènes de tension. 
          Celles-ci sont d’ailleurs développées tout aussi 
          modestement par le biais de bruits chaotiques émanant d’éboulements 
          de cailloux et de craquements de branches d’arbres, en plus de 
          rires détraqués d’enfants se manifestant aux petites 
          heures de la nuit. Mais pour que le tout reproduise l’effet escompté, 
          encore fallait-il mettre ces éléments en contexte. En 
          ce sens, les intentions simplistes de départ s’appuient 
          sur la remarquable rapidité et l’aisance avec laquelle 
          fut introduite de manière descriptive l’étrange 
          mythologie entourant les évènements macabres du passé 
          de la région. The Blair Witch Project se sert du même 
          coup de l’environnement où évolue le récit 
          en renversant le rôle ordinairement associé à la 
          forêt, synonyme de solitude et d'un endroit où devrait 
          y régner un calme imperturbable, en particulier au beau milieu 
          de la nuit.

          En un tout, l’habileté du film à faire passer cette 
          fiction pour la réalité d’une manière aussi 
          humble tient presque du génie. Par contre, comme c’est 
          le cas pour bien des films bénéficiant à la première 
          écoute de l’effet de surprise, il est loin d’être 
          certain que celui-ci jouira d’une durée de vie assez longue 
          pour qu’il puisse obtenir le statut d’oeuvre culte. Néanmoins, 
          pour ceux qui sauront s’adapter à la frénésie 
          visuelle de l’effort, The Blair Witch Project se révélera 
          comme une œuvre marquante de par son ambiance funèbre et 
          stressante exponentiellement recréée. Cette histoire se 
          termine somme toute par une apogée plutôt évidente 
          dont l’apparence beaucoup plus testamentaire que cinématographique 
          saura semer le doute chez les spectateurs sceptiques face à la 
          probable existence de ce genre d’histoires."

"Jul 21, 2005",positive," In a world that rewards film artifice for how tricky it can get -- think The Matrix or The Phantom Menace -- The Blair Witch Project is a breath of fresh air.
 Presented as if showing real events, the film is about three college students who enter deep woods in Maryland to shoot a documentary about a creepy legend. It seems a woman charged with witchcraft in 1785 was banished from the town of Blair. Mysterious disappearances and horrific deaths have hit the area ever since, the last time in 1941. Like Jonathan Harker naively approaching Castle Dracula, Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard and Michael Williams (the actors lend their real names) explore the legend in October 1994. They venture forth with a 16 mm camera, a camcorder, camping equipment and a map they have trouble reading. They are never heard from again. The actors themselves shot all the footage -- surely this is a first for movies -- and some may balk at the deliberate crudeness of their visuals. These mix black-and-white film stock with color video, most of it jumpy, poorly focused and badly framed. Yet these aren't affected ""shaky-cam"" shots overused in TV commercials. Rather, the film's stark home-movie feel serves a real purpose, fueling its disturbing sense of you-are-there reality. You could quibble that they wouldn't have used their cameras so much; we don't miss much. But Heather -- the obsessive leader -- has a compulsion to record things, and in darkness the cameras provide illumination, not just documentation. As Stephen King suggests in his latest novel, The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, being lost in the wilderness is frightening enough. Most of the students' tensions, erupting arguments and emotional unraveling stem from that simple fact. As convincing and potent as it can be on these terms, be warned that the film is far removed from today's cinema standards. For many, Blair Witch will be a tough sell, and the oversell it's receiving does not serve it well. This is one horror flick with no graphic special effects or so-called ""money shots."" One computer-generated extra in a George Lucas picture would blow the entire budget for this movie. But you can't put a price on imagination and originality. Besides, some of the best fright fests of recent decades have been similarly cheap yet effective, from Night of the Living Dead in the '60s to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre in the '70s to The Evil Dead in the '80s. Blair Witch's harsh realism sets it apart, and that realism owes less to convincing visuals than remarkably naturalistic performances from actors who improvised each line. Many movies try to transport us with dazzle, but few have the convincing reality of Blair Witch. If you can handle its unconventional approach, you won't feel as if you're seeing a film so much as witnessing a living nightmare."

Rated R - Running Time: 1:22 - Released 7/16/99
The effectiveness of The Blair Witch Project depends greatly on the
audience's uncertainty about whether or not it really happened. The amateur
style and the pervasive reality of the situation imply that this was simply
a homemade documentary that went terribly wrong. This notion is also fostered
by an ingenious device employed by writer/directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo
Sánchez. Some of the film's shoestring budget (I have heard anywhere
from $20 to 60 thousand) was used for development of the Internet website
(www.blairwitch.com), which includes
a detailed history of the bogus legend dating back to the 1700s, pictures
of ""found"" video and audio tape and film (with links to let you
see and hear the footage), as well as police photos of the car and other
gear supposedly discovered in 1995. There are news stories about the rescue
efforts and recovery, lawsuits, statements from the students' parents, etc.
All this, plus a quasi-documentary about the legend which aired on Sci-Fi
last weekend, created the rumor that this story was all true. Myrick and
Sánchez saw the incredible potential of the Internet as a rumor mill
and used it to the best effect.
 Three college students, Heather Donahue (the director), Joshua Leonard
(the cameraman), and Michael Williams (the sound engineer), are said to
have been lost in 1994 while attempting to make a college film project involving
the legend of a witch who lived centuries ago in remote Maryland. At the
beginning of the film, they are seen preparing for a camping weekend, packing,
joking, interviewing locals from Burkittsville, Md. (formerly Blair), and
setting off into the woods with a video camcorder, a 16 millimeter movie
camera, and a digital audio tape recorder. After their planned documentary
seems a bust, they lose their map, lose their way, and lose their patience
with each other. What emerges is a shockingly realistic home movie of increasing
terror leading to the students' mysterious demise.
 In a master stroke, Myrick and Sánchez hired three actors to basically
play themselves. In fact, in the film they are not so much acting as living
— using their real names, and simply capturing on film and videotape
the unsettling situation in which they found themselves. Sacrificing production
quality for realism, Myrick and Sánchez cut the three actors loose
in the forest (in Seneca Creek State Park, Md.) for 6 days and never contacted
them directly during that time. Each day, the campers would be instructed
to hike to a spot where sealed messages were left for them, giving minimal
hints as to what to expect or which way to go that day. Every night the
crew would find different ways to ""play with their heads,"" but
they never knew what to expect, and what we get is pure realism — their
raw, unrehearsed reactions to the eerie sights and sounds they experienced.
 Cutting back and forth between the video and 16mm film shot by the actors,
The Blair Witch Project conveys exactly what the rumors say it is
— the rough footage taken by three lost students who finally disappeared.
Myrick and Sánchez created something that will be remembered not
so much for its story or professional quality, but for its novel approach
and the impact that resulted. Though there is no music, no script, and no
special effects, this is the most gripping horror film I have ever seen.
 In addition to the genius of Myrick and Sánchez, the film's effectiveness
owes great debt to the performances of the actors, especially Heather Donahue.
The tone, which grows gradually from light-hearted cynicism to full-blown
terror, is dependent completely on the ability of these three actors not
to break character while the cameras were running. Donahue's tearful final
scene, shot after a week in the woods, is some of the most real acting I
have ever seen.

"Jun 18, 2002",positive,"  THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT: Thriller. Starring Heather Donahue, Michael C. Williams and Joshua Leonard. Directed and written by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez. (R. 87 minutes. At the Bridge and Act One/Act Two in Berkeley.) It's also distinctly unpleasant. The thrills in this one-of-a-kind film, which opens today after winning acclaim at the Sundance and Cannes film festivals, aren't the artificial kind we know from genre pieces such as ""Halloween"" or ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" -- but the raw, soul-scraping horror of a nightmare. Co-directed by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, ""The Blair Witch Project"" is a pseudo- documentary about three student filmmakers who get lost in the Maryland woods. Hoping to explore the 200-year-old legend of the ""Blair Witch"" and the cult that surrounds it, the film crew bickers, gets lost and finally panics at the possibility of never getting out alive. The movie pretends that the ""filmmakers"" -- the overbearing ""director"" Heather Donahue, laid-back ""cameraman"" Joshua Leonard and prickly ""sound recordist"" Michael C. Williams -- each disappeared in the woods. The footage in ""Blair Witch,"" we're told, was discovered one year later. That's a pretty cool concept for a film. In fact, ""The Blair Witch Project"" is pure fiction, and Donahue, Leonard and Williams, using their real names, are actors who are still alive. But at least half of the appeal of the ""The Blair Witch Proj ect"" comes from wondering how they and the filmmakers were able to create such amazing authenticity onscreen. How did the actors, none of whom came to the project with much film experience, reach the primal, off-the-chart emotional states that we see in the film? Is it just brilliantly good acting -- the kind that John Cassavetes drew from his actors -- or did Myrick and Sanchez scare the living hell out of them? In interviews and in press materials provided by the film's distributor, Myrick and Sanchez say they spent two days training the actors in the use of film and video cameras, and set them loose in the forest with no script, a modicum of food and only a rough set of situational guidelines. Whereas the tenderfoot characters they play are unable to read topographical maps -- and find themselves desperately walking in circles -- the actors in fact had Global Positioning System (GSP) handsets to find their way. The dialogue, we're told, was all improvised, and the camera work was all done by the actors. For better and for worse, ""The Blair Witch Project"" has the grainy, handheld look of a home movie or student project. Funkiness of that sort works here because it heightens the realism -- and replaces the filter of ""professionalism"" that typically insulates and protects us from true terror. It also becomes excruciatingly unpleasant for anyone, including this critic, who gets sick from watching too many handheld camera swoops and jerky pans. As with ""Breaking the Waves,"" ""Celebration"" and Woody Allen's ""Husbands and Wives,"" ""The Blair Witch Project"" is certain to nauseate a portion of its audience. As an experiment in technique and simulated realism, ""Blair Witch"" is enormously successful. Myrick and Sanchez pave new territory with their self-described ""method filmmaking,"" and their actors, Donahue in particular, are incredi bly effective at yanking us into the desperate terror that their characters experience. After a while, though, ""The Blair Witch Project' is neither fun nor exhilarating in that adrenaline-inducing way we're accustomed to from horror movies. It's just dreadful and draining and, for some of us, literally sickening."

"Mar 24, 2002",positive," THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, Written and directed by Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick. With Heather Donahue, Michael Williams, and Joshua Leonard. An Artisan Entertainment release. At the Kendall Square and in the suburbs.  Probably the first time audiences were scared at a movie was at that legendary 1895 screening of the Lumière brothers' L'arrivée d'un train en gare, when viewers panicked at what they thought was a real locomotive hurtling at them. Their fright no doubt passed with the film's second screening, and certainly with the popularity of Georges Méliès's pioneering special-effects fantasy A Trip to the Moon a few years later. But that first naive thrill over an illusion remains an elusive goal for those who make and watch movies. More than just the voyeuristic realism of tabloid TV shows like Cops, it's about the desire to be drawn into a trompe-l'oeil deception, a vicarious immersion into primal, first-person terror. Such is the appeal of independent filmmakers Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick's bold, brilliant, ultimately doomed The Blair Witch Project, a film concept so fresh and obvious (Anna Campion's Loaded in 1994 had the same basic premise but a much different treatment), it's amazing no one has come up with it before. No credits or title sequence frame what purports to be the ultimate found footage, shot by of a trio of students who vanished while making a documentary film about the Blair Witch, a 200-year-old legendary apparition haunting the backwoods and the subconscious of the Black Woods of western Maryland. The gimmick is so ingenious, though, that it doesn't work; as with cutting-edge special-effects extravaganzas, wonder is replaced by fascination as to how the illusion is crafted. We know this isn't real, so fright gives way to assessing how clever the filmmakers are at trying to sustain our disbelief. Very clever indeed, at least to begin with. The three young filmmakers make distinct impressions in their self-shot, jumbled melange of preliminary footage. Heather (Heather Donahue), tough-minded and overly earnest and the brains of the project, operates the video camera for the behind-the-scenes or ""the making of"" footage; hers is the dominant point of view and, perhaps, the unconscious shaper of what follows. The other two crew members seem more like skeptical hired hands. Wispy Josh (Joshua Leonard), who wields the 16mm black-and-white camera, and beefy Mike (Michael Williams), the sound man, have a slacker charm and insouciance. They are clearly cowed by Heather, and the tension between them and their boss is not sexual or sexist but authoritarian. Bantering and low-key though they are in their improvised dialogue (the actors should get a writing and cinematography credit), the three hint at a borderline hysteria that could ignite even without the manifestation of a Blair Witch. The details of that legend, as concocted by the filmmakers and related in pseudo-interviews with locals, have a creepy authenticity. Originally a woman banished from the community in the 18th century for unorthodox medical practices perceived as black magic, the ""witch"" has since returned in various incarnations. A pair of fisherman interviewees point out a rock where victims were found bound and eviscerated. They tell of an old house in the woods where, in the 1940s, an old man confessed to killing children at the witch's bidding. Going in search of that house, our three heroes lose their way. The film does, too. There forms a pattern of nocturnal terrors followed by an daytime rationalization (it's the pattern of Shirley Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House, though it may not be discernible in Jan de Bont's f/x-heavy upcoming adaptation, The Haunting) and a gradual breakdown of civilized façades. The night is cut by heavy breathing, truncated dialogue, and distant howls in the darkness; the day reveals artifacts left behind -- a hole full of stones, stick figures that are a masterpiece of ambiguous evil. And for a night or two, the terror is visceral. But as in any horror film, repetition breeds contempt. Like another Artisan release, Pi, The Blair Witch Project might have been more powerful as a short subject. Or some areas could have been further developed. Is Heather herself the witch, onto whom Mike and Josh are projecting their own terrors? What is the significance of the two film formats in terms of point of view? Is one more real than the other? Couldn't more have been implied with the space off screen, and the ellipses of time between segments of footage? And what of the camera's role as a device for fending off, however futilely, inescapable horror? That last question might be the point of the whole project. The scariest shot in the movie is not any literal image hurtling from the screen, but a frame of total darkness. Seeing may be believing, The Blair Witch Project suggests, but what is unseen is terrifying beyond belief. "
"Mar 4, 2002",positive," The opening title card reads: ""On October 21, 1994, three filmmakers, Heather Donohue, Joshua Leonard, and Michael Williams, hiked into the Black Hills Forest of Maryland to shoot a documentary film on a local legend called 'The Blair Witch' and were never seen or heard from again. One year later their footage was found. 'The Blair Witch Project' is their legacy, documenting their final days and nights in the woods and the events that unfolded before their cameras."" Right off the bat, let's salute the fact that this scary fictional film written, directed, and edited by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez gives us goosebumps without resorting to the pyrotechnics of bloody gore and hyper-violence! The drama taps into the same elements of mystery and dread that made horror stories told around campfires in the dark so hair-raising and addictive. Like those whispered tales, the emphasis here is upon the monsters, murderers, and demons that haunt our consciousness. Anyone who has ever been lost or out in the woods at night will relive the experience during this film. Anyone who has been in a life-threatening situation with others will recognize the way fear and self-preservation can swallow up bonds of friendship, teamwork, and trust. Perhaps the most surprising and thought-provoking aspect of The Blair Witch Project is that it serves as a cautionary tale for us all: our behavior in a crisis may be the legacy of our life that all the world sees. Despite its flimsy dialogue and its lack of character development, this horror film made for teens and twentysomethings adds a few fresh twists and turns to a genre that has recently become enslaved to nothing more than special effects."

"Aug 19, 2001",positive," Authorities turn up raw footage shot by a group of film students who disappeared in the Black Hills Forest of Maryland. The tape details the mysterious events leading up to their disappearance. Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez’s The Blair Witch Project is as riveting and terrifying a study of fear as it is a chilling reminder of the inscrutability of myth. Heather Donahue is as obnoxious as she is sadly aware of the limitations that come with being a female filmmaker—she seeks control over a crew of men unwilling to give her the benefit of the doubt. Shooting a documentary on the mythical Blair Witch, Heather and her companions realize the futility of their project when the townspeople they interview prove to be less than engaging subjects. The deeper they move into the woods, the spookier their journey becomes. Their documentary becomes a diary of fear and, in the end, comes to resemble what they hoped to secure all along. They are naïve journeyfolk unaware that they’ve become pawns of the very myth they seek to capture. Terrifying despite the fact that so little happens, The Blair Witch Project is most remarkable in its evocation of myths refusing comprehension. Ed Gonzalez is the co-founder of Slant Magazine.

"Feb 14, 2001",positive," “The Blair Witch Project” has received so much advance press that you probably already know that it is a “mockumentary” that’s received rave reviews on the festival circuit. And that’s too bad since all that attention ultimately does a disservice to the audience. Those who go into the film cold are of course more likely to experience thrills and chills than those who know what they’re getting into--the second group, however, can expect an unsettling experience, capped by a couple of jolts at the finish, as the film’s twists and turns are impossible to predict and do generate low-key suspense. Some rave quotes suggest that you’re in for a scare of “Exorcist” proportions, whereas “Blair Witch” is essentially an exceedingly ingenious diversion. In short, the film is a clever, entertaining stunt, no more, no less, and a terrific calling card for its fledgling filmmakers, Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez. An opening statement tells us that on Oct. 21, 1994, Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard and Michael Williams hiked into Maryland’s Black Hills Forest to shoot a documentary on a local legend of the so-called Blair Witch, a woman named Elly Kedward who was supposed to have caused half the youngsters of Blair village to vanish more than 200 years ago. In 1824, the town of Burkittsville was founded on the site of Blair; between November 1940 and May 1941, the town was rocked by the ritualistic slayings of seven children by a local hermit named Rustin Parr, who, after giving himself up, tells authorities that he did it for “an old woman ghost.” Once we’re informed that the student filmmakers disappeared without a trace but that we will be looking at the footage they shot--found a year later--we are abruptly thrust into the quickly menacing world of that footage. The filmmakers have taken tremendous pains to bring to it enough coherence so that we can be involved in the students’ plight as it unfolds yet maintain enough jaggedness so that “Blair Project’s” fakery is utterly convincing. Leonard serves as cinematographer, shooting in 16 millimeter, while Williams is the project’s sound man. In the meantime Heather records the group’s growing rifts on High-8 video and her comments on those rifts; this is an unobtrusive and persuasive device that provides a crucial narrative flow in a completely natural way. Heather, whose project it is, comes off as headstrong and determined to maintain control of her shoot at all costs. She’s strong on using all the correct terms for the shoot-from-the-hip kind of documentary she’s trying to make. There’s something highhanded, a little condescending and insensitive about Heather as she goes about interviewing locals before she and her crew enter the forest, where they quickly get lost and soon become subjected to a series of mysterious and malevolent incidents. The men become outraged at Heather for the predicament she got them into, but all three young people are smart enough to know that if they are to have a hope of making it out of the forest they’ve got to pull together. All three are playing roles, although they use their actual names, and the way in which Myrick and Sanchez make improvisation work within their outline, keeping their cast in the dark and off balance as much as possible, is nothing less than amazing. You can, if you want, buy into the possibility of supernatural forces acting as the prime mover or believe the trio has fallen victim to some unseen person or people who simply are in the grip of madness. Donahue, Leonard and Williams are as absolutely believable as everything else about the film. If you’re willing to look beyond the fright tactics in “Blair Witch,” you can enjoy it as a kind of mordant commentary on the presumptuousness of brash and inexperienced documentary filmmakers who, in this extreme instance, plunge into a forest wilderness with woefully inadequate preparation and who actually think they will somehow be able to record supernatural manifestations on film. In the final analysis, “Blair Witch” is perhaps more amusing and satisfying as a cautionary tale deflating a certain kind of filmmaking arrogance than it is as an offbeat horror show.

Ingenious in its simplicity, The Blair Witch Project arrives in theatres on the wave of a huge buzz of curiosity. It is destined to be one of the indie-film success stories of the decade: a bare-bones film made for a low five-figure budget; a film picked up for distribution within hours of its first midnight screening at Sundance; a film that has aroused a swell of anticipatory excitement, a flood of publicity, and ancillary products involving comic books, CDs, Web sites, and a made-for-TV special. The Blair Witch Project has become its own urban legend.
