Apr 13 2024,positive,bizarrely great tale of child mutilation 7510 very christian
Apr 13 2024,positive,a well deserved cult classic a fantasy world in which the most famous chocolate magnate of the world makes a contest to decide whos going to be his successor a fun ride following four very weird kids and one destined to win from the start predictable at times surprising at others but definitely a heart warming story about family love and chocolate a lot of chocolate 3
Apr 5 2024,negative,this movie should have been called charlie and the child molester in my humble opinion  this movie was a major insult to the original movie and did not bear any resemblance to the book either  the first is the best and the new one with timothe chamalet is a close second  tim burton should have sued for destroying a classic movie for his own perverted views of the original movie and the book
Apr 2 2024,negative,i know they were trying to match the book to this version if the movie but compared to the gene wilder version this movie falls monstrously short while i have great admiration for certain well known cast members as well as director tim burton this movie was a major disappointment where i figured they would surpass the original because of modern technology problem 1 the music was horrible 2 instead of hiring little people they took thier jobs and gave it to only 1 making the oomps loompas boring 3 the factory tour was complete garbage this looked absolutely amazing in the original and it looked like lazy garbage in this remake when considering the advancements in tech makeup etc it should have been mind blowing i havent encountered anyone personally that liked this version more only time i have encountered it was through the reviews on here im sorry i cant give a top rating just because of the amazing actors and director whos other works i love immensely this film fell short and i have to be honest about it and not give a top rating based solely on whos in it and whos directing it
Mar 31 2024,positive,great but no where near on par with the original
Mar 31 2024,negative,creepy  and not in the good way
Mar 21 2024,positive,so overwhelmingly weird  love it totally rewatchable
Mar 11 2024,positive,its a classic tim burton always makes things delightfully weird
Mar 9 2024,positive,can i just say this one thing this movie is and i repeat is not a remake of willy wonka and the chocolate factory but instead its another adaptation of the book and yes willy wonka was not the originator of this story and it is in fact just a adaptation of the original charlie and the chocolate factory book by roald dahl its like the people who say that this movie is a remake of willy wonka and the chocolate factory or its not as good as the original didnt know that it came from a book
Mar 9 2024,positive,good morning starshine the earth says hello gets me every time i know most people find this movie weird but i find it funny and enjoyable loved watching as a kid and a teenager now
Mar 3 2024,neutral,i liked the direction burton was going for but i barely remembered anything about the movie except that creepy doll show when theyre in the factory so maybe tim burton should stick to batman instead
Feb 24 2024,negative,i loved the original willy wonka movie from 1971 whiches why i wanted to watch this movie and superisingly it had so much potential in the first 30 minuets but was automatically killed by the cgi now look judging a movie by cgi isnt a thing you should do but this this is just horrendous
Jan 23 2024,positive,way better then the original songs aside because the songs on this version have nothing on the original songs
Jan 21 2024,positive,this is a good movie that i watched as a kid
Jan 19 2024,positive,so creative and intriguing love this film

Jan 17 2024,positive,its pretty good but it is not as good as gene wilders movie
Jan 13 2024,positive,its my favorite willy wonka movie of all time
Jan 11 2024,negative,looking back this movie is the most forgettable of the three wonkas depps wonka seems alien and cold compared to the warmth of timothee chalamet and quirkiness of gene wilder
Jan 8 2024,negative,the original was better
Jan 7 2024,positive,funny and overall watchable
Jan 2 2024,positive,this movie follows the book much better then the gene wilder film
Dec 27 2023,positive,best movie ever this is so good
Dec 23 2023,positive,i was very apprehensive about this remake i am old school and hate remakes but after seeing it for the first time i found it very very enjoyable i have since seen this multiple times and thoroughly enjoy it they did a real good job with this one
Dec 18 2023,positive,loved this movie as a kid ive probably seen it close to 100 times i also prefer this to the gene wilder version it seems to resemble the book more than the original movie
Dec 18 2023,positive,it is kinda boring and the voices are annoying mainly watched it in the car to pass time
Dec 18 2023,positive,one of the best movies ngl i watch that every year 4 times 
Dec 17 2023,positive,charming and very funny at times although still containing some of the edgy and dark elements of the first overall charlie and the chocolate factory will always have a strange place in the list of adaptations
Dec 17 2023,negative,the movie was pure unvarnished ass no creative dialogue and willy wonka was eccentric but in the worst way possible he lacked timing humor charisma he was unlikable  the gene wilder version is far superior
Dec 16 2023,positive,the best ever version of willy wonka without a doubt its an awesome movie
Dec 10 2023,positive,brilliant charismatic
Dec 7 2023,neutral,my rating is 510  most creepy willy wonka ever  is just a copy of the original  same history just with different actors  it gives me real bad vibes  didnt liked it at all
Dec 7 2023,neutral,its incredibly weird moments just dont bring and laughter but an irritable sigh even though this movie is not great its actually connected to the original charlie and the chocolate factory book from 1964 and whats even more weird is that we see what actually happen to the kids towards the end of the movie this film is a solid  d
Dec 5 2023,positive,not as good as the original still entertaining though
Nov 11 2023,positive,the movie is better than the original movie
Oct 31 2023,positive,its a decent remake gene wilders film is hard to beat
Oct 30 2023,positive,love love love the film better than the imagination i had from the book  i still cannot believe that willy wonka is the captain and edward just amazing acting i could watch this over and over again
Oct 15 2023,neutral,in 2005 tim burton released his unique take on roald dahls charlie and the chocolate factory starring johnny depp as mysterious chocolatier willy wonka who invites 5 lucky golden ticket winners to visit his strange factory    remaking a classic like willy wonka and the chocolate factory was always going to be a risky move but if one person could put their own offbeat spin on such a well known story tim burton was the guy coming off his first big critical defeat planet of the apes and the more personal lowerkey big fish this was set along with corpse bride released the same year to be tim burtons first big adaptation since sleepy hollow and perhaps a return to form the film was a commercial success receiving generally favorable reviews    charlie and the chocolate factory breaks with the original film as its not really a musical adaptation despite the obligatory oompa loompa songs and attempts to stay closer to the original story in a few more ways burtons style is very much its own character here as we are introduced to the titular factory in slick fashion with the excellent danny elfman theme luring us into the heart of the chocolatemaking factory we then meet our new charlie played by freddie highmore who captures the characters inherent goodness and innocence but fails to convince emotionally or stand out as the films lead the entire supporting cast in fact feels surprisingly bland compared to the old gene wilderstarrer    even johnny depp whose michael jackson impression is certainly offkilter struggles to give his character more than one dimension the cast certainly look the part but we never feel like these are real people and as caricatures they dont really do or say anything that funny the almost onpurpose weak script really hurts this film by not giving the cast anything genuinely amusing or clever to work with there are jokes but they are all eyerollingly bad and the constant flashbacks dont help with the already onandoff pacing     the buildup to the factory in consequence is unexciting and once were in there things definitely get silly and weird but never actually funny gene wilder could effortlessly with a single look or well delivered line tell you a lot about his character and make you laugh depp tries very hard but ultimately this characterization comes off as a misstep and the actor has a tough time making it stick    the movie is saved by how eagertoplease it is its colorful visuals and the everreliable danny elfman who is clearly doing a million things in this movie hes the voice of every single oompa loompa and does the score to the point where the composersinger feels overwhelmed here especially when you know he was working on corpse bride at the same time the result is a solid score and a bunch of songs that each are a bit of a mess but which you look forward to nonetheless     when they happen they are good fun but you wont remember much about them soon after the idea to have deep roy be every oompa loompa was a funny one but having differentlooking oompa loompas allowed for nifty harmonizing which doesnt really work here the effects are good for the time but the cg hasnt aged that well and the green screen stuff can be clunky at times    the decision to introduce a backstory for wonka by reuniting him with his father christopher lee graciously cameoing was an interesting one but it is not done well here as this story is told through lots of flashbacks and the payoff is barely rewarding on an emotional level its cute but not something that was worth interrupting the pace of the film constantly for the film might have been better off as a full prequel or as a straightup remake because this hybrid is just irritating even if the flashbacks by themselves are done well even visually though this is a colorful flick one would expect something a tad more interesting from burton    charlie and the chocolate factory certainly had everything it needed to be a worthy reimagining of the classic story but tim burton and the cast just couldnt elevate the heartbreakingly poor script what youre left with alas is an appealingly odd candy shell of a movie with nothing inside    got the copper ticket that time didnt we
Sep 29 2023,positive,it was good movie with family members
Sep 21 2023,positive,one of my favorite movies johnny is awesome in this
Aug 29 2023,negative,this movie was an abomination johnny depps performance was obnoxious the cgi was horrible and there was zero charm to the wonka character it was just bizarre you can tell they paid a lot to reviewers only half the audience liked it but critics were kind to depp    unless you just want to watch a horrible movie and see the work remake in history theres little reason to watch this depps character is so devoid of personality or charm that its painful to watch
Aug 20 2023,positive,nice to watch it has a good identity and good developments
Aug 14 2023,positive,another collaboration between tim burton johnny depp and helena bonhamcarter no you will never be able to find a better willy wonka than gene wilder but i believe this version is a more true adaptation to the roald dahl classic tale about poor little charlie bucket depp manages to wholly disappear into the role of the wild whimsical chocolatier and huge kudos to deep roy for playing every oompa loompa repeating the same movements several hundred times
Aug 11 2023,positive,this film is full of tim burton charm its closer to the book than the original and johnny depp gives and creepy quirky and whimsical performance as willy wonka its all fantastic
Jul 25 2023,negative,whilst more faithful to the book this bigger budget star studded take on the 1960s roald dahl novel feels at best a slightly tweaked copy of the original gene wilder film at worst a tim burton fever dream that delivers more cringe than charisma look i know burton knows johnny depp and helena bonham carter better than any other actors but that doesnt mean he has to cast them in every single film he makes especially when many of the roles they inhabit are loopy reimaginings of prior performances depp took a character that the great gene wilder brought to life with an enigmatic and charismatic stoicism about him and turned him into a creepy childish and overly unhinged take on the character that would make the author roll in his grave and thats before he starts spouting nonsense like oh boy and lets boogie the child performers in the film were undoubtedly the highlights freddie highmore bringing charm and humility to the role of charlie and the other four coming off as exceptionally impudent and insufferable which is the biggest compliment i can give them in this context but overall this film felt very much style over substance on the surface its beautifully designed and filmed but it is clear that far more time was put into making it look nice than giving us convincing performances or a good script
Jul 25 2023,positive,this should be higher than the barbie movie
Jul 24 2023,positive,respect for the original story of the book beauty in the scenes good effects and outfits tim burtons magical touch a lot of people think that is dark but is so colorfull i mean this movie gives a great story we need to stop comparing to gene wilder that was made in other porpouse and other line
Jul 14 2023,positive,its not the best reimagined movie of a beloved film ever but still manages to be a decent film with the only real enjoyable thing about the movie is willy wonka himself
Jun 27 2023,positive,unpopular opinion but i actually really liked this movie its much weirder and mysterious than the original tim burton films are always like that
Jun 20 2023,positive,tim burton brings his gothic craziness to his version of a much loved movie and book and on whole he does a great job
Jun 17 2023,positive,es buen remake de willy wonka y la fabrica de chocolate solo el willy wonka de esta version no me gusta da gringe pero es buen remake
Jun 9 2023,positive,decent and easy to differentiate from the previous adaption despite using the same source the difference is night and day   excellent cast unique interpretation it had stiff competition with comparisons to the previous iteration but i still think its very good in its own way i love both versions for different reasons
Jun 4 2023,positive,i can understand people dont like when directors do remakes of classics but this is not one of this cases tim burton does in fact his version of the book not the 1971 movie and i cant help but love it the acting is really good especially depp and highmore the sets are stunning and burton adds his darker tone keeping it perfect
Jun 2 2023,negative,im sorry but this is johnny depps worst movie that hes ever done
May 19 2023,positive,one of the greatest 2000s movies ive ever seen the wacky cgi makes the movie funny and colorful and the songs are absolutely amazing with my personal favorite being violets song this movie absolutely topped the original movie and i highly recommend seeing this movie if you have ever watched the original movie 1010 would see again
May 17 2023,neutral,after watching willy wonka and the chocolate factory and this film backtoback there are specific differences and elements that i appreciated more with each separate adaptation the storytelling was crisp especially leading up to the morning of february 1st and i enjoyed the scenes outside the chocolate factory more in this film the cinematography was great the production design was fantastic and the score was uniquely tim burtonesque unfortunately my praise for this adaptation stops there    in the first variation the story truly begins once the children enter the chocolate factory in this film once at the chocolate factory the entire film falls apart johnny depps willy wonka was offputting and lacked the charm of gene wilder the flashback sequences were unnecessary and distracted from the plot itself the oompa loompas were interesting but their size was strange and their songs were a tad too long ultimately this film lacked a real relationship between wonka and charlie which seemed forced in an unwarranted third act detour    while there were elements of this film that i enjoyed it pales in comparison to the original and that is mostly due to the lack of heart and willy wonka himself
May 5 2023,negative,i like when the little girl blows up 110
Apr 20 2023,positive,colorful zany and delightful to watch personally i prefer this to the original it has a much more polished look that can even border on uncanny at times which works to the movies advantage not to mention that the candy looks very appetizing  fun fact the song lyrics from this movie are directly taken from the book
Apr 13 2023,negative,i wanted to give 0 stars but it doesnt
Apr 12 2023,negative,its not even close in quality to the original but it is an ok movie on its on
Apr 11 2023,negative,so so so badand not in a good way either d
Apr 4 2023,positive,one of my favourite movies is  charlie and chocolate factory i watched this movie several times this movie was made on july 10 2005 by tim burton the author of this film was john august the film was set in three different countries such as usa uk and australia the genre of this movie is fantasy    this movie is about willie wonk who owns a fantastical factory with delicous chocolates and sweets one day one of his workers sells the secret recipes for other companies and wonka closes the factory for all workers after several years wonka realizes that he is getting older and wants someone operate his factory that is why he will have an idea to hide five golden tickets under the cover of chocolate bars five children who will find these tickets will have a chance to visit his chocolate factory with one of the members of their family willie wonka finds the winner according to the childrens behaviour the winner was charlie who lives in a very small house with his parents and two grandparents they were really poor charlie doesnt want to operate the factory without his family and refuses the deal with wonka at the end of this movie wonka realizes that the life is meaningful with family and he starts to live with his father as well    the main charachters of this film are wonka and charlie the films stars johnny depp as willy wonka and freddie highmore as charlie bucket one of the most famous film of johnny depp as a main charachter is pirates of the caribbean there are also actors such as david kelly helena bonham carter noah taylor missi dyle and james fox    the film will be interesting for all age groups children teenagers and adults as well but it is not recommended to watch this movie for children who are under five years old because there will be some scarefull scenes that children may be afraid of when adults watch this movie they fell like backing into childhood period and the film brings them the nostalgic memories of this period
Mar 22 2023,positive,while its uncertain whether charlie and the chocolate factory can hold its own against the original which surpasses it in almost every aspect theres a strange yet noteworthy quality to tim burtons adaptation of roald dahls classic
Feb 26 2023,positive,80 worst charlie and the chocolate factory
Feb 24 2023,positive,better version of willy wonka
Feb 9 2023,neutral,it has a few merits but its got nothing on the original
Jan 16 2023,negative,horrible in every way
Dec 12 2022,positive,not as good as the original but still good nonetheless johnny depp is really the only reason this movie was good i think any other actor that would have played that character would have made the movie suck
Dec 9 2022,positive,nice adaptation of the original different new look and i do like depps performance 
Oct 25 2022,positive,i went to college with willy wonka he was a good guy who smokes a lot of weed
Oct 14 2022,negative,see the original film instead
Oct 12 2022,positive,i soulheartly love the movie get mad at me all you want but its much better than the 71 movie fun fact the author roald dahl hates the 1971 movie his wife did say that he would loved this version
Sep 28 2022,positive,one that ive seen multiple times i enjoy the different fates of the kids and jonny depps performance
Sep 4 2022,positive,burtons take on one of the greatest childrens book is a dark yet still faithful take on charlie and the chocolate factory that we all love and hate
Aug 30 2022,negative,watch the original movie  it is a lot better
Aug 21 2022,positive,charlie and the chocolate factory is not perfect but is better than the 1971 film willy wonka and the chocolate factory in every single aspect firstly the maximalist approach of the factory pleased me much more in the 1971 movie all the scenarios look like stage sets which was something that took me out of that place constantly and as i said in my review of that film made me feel like only a casual spectator not a sixth child on that place but in the 2005 film wonkas factory is imposing inside and outside and as its a pharaonic building without almost any sign of life only with trucks carrying pounds of chocolate bars that are already addressed that place becomes even more mysterious secondly another hit in tim burtons version the 1971 film was directed by mel stuart is the oompa loompas and how this new version is not a musical anymore while the first film is a musical but not with good songs except for the candy man the songs in the second one are left just for when the characters are already inside the factory located on specific points and sung by the oompa loompas verucas one is my favourite by the way the oompa loompas visual and behaviour have changed radically as well they went from that horrible orange makeup to simple middleaged dwarfs and musically they went from that annoying oompa loompa doo ba dee doo to songs with unique letters and even the worst song is better than anyone from the old movie thirdly not only the children but every important character in the film gained at least a personality trace starting from charlies grandparents grandpa joe who goes with his grandson to the factory has now a past willy wonka and wants even more than the kid to go to that place grandma josephine is the reason voice grandpa george is the grumpy one and grandma georgina is someone completely oblivious to reality the kids have also changed augustus gloop no hes still that little german addicted to chocolate veruca salt is less annoying but shes still pampered and his father looks like jair bolsonaro brazils president violet beauregarde is more competitive than in the first film and mike teevee changed completely from a kid who is innocent to everything not related to television to a snobby and smart hacker who hates chocolate and to be honest i liked that change 34 years have been passed from one film to the other and in his introduction scene hes not watching tv anymore but playing a videogame this character reflects perfectly how the tv programmes and facilities can interfere in a childs behaviour and how in both cases how the parental negligence can affect kids as well briefly all the kids maintained their essence now lets talk about the two main characters first charlie bucket i liked freddie highmore more than peter ostrum and i honestly think that the character being an orphan in the first film weakens the background in the 2005 version charlie has all his parents and grandparents and his father has been fired recently from a job that used to pay a terrible salary and although he seems to want less to go to the factory he is definitely more humble than his predecessor and putting this together freddie seems more worthy of the prize than peter and finally the eccentric guy responsible for the most fantastic chocolate factory in the world willy wonka johnny depp and gene wilder give totally different approaches to this character while wilder treats the chocolatier as a psychopath the cat in the hat with exaggerated and cartoonish expressions depps willy wonka is more restrained physically his figurines are darker his jokes with one exception are more efficient and he has a backstory unlike gene wilder which is pretty interesting i must admit its a shame that his father made by the legendary christopher lee is a stereotyped dentist who has aversion to candies the ending is not at the same level as the rest of the film but its still better than the one from the 1971 movie and the way how the messages is passed is more natural and also stronger one of the most underrated films in tim burtons filmography and as roald dahl didnt like the first version i think he would like this one if he was alive he passed away in 1990
Aug 20 2022,positive,a new take on the original which was the crowning jewel of movies from my childhood  the original is superior but this is a fun take that is more modern and also has the very saturated color palette of burtons more recent films  while i prefer the practical effects of the original these are done well  depp is of course amazing and you get the sense that wonka is certainly quite easy for him to become  i was excited when this was first announced but was worried it would be a terrible cash grab  i was pleasantly surprised when it was good in its own way
Jul 16 2022,positive,a surprisingly unforgettable movie that leaves a mark with its innovation to the willy wonka character of both the catcf movies im surprised this remake takes the spotlight for me as i thought this would be more of a movie driven by nostalgia thankfully johnny depps performance as willy wonka easily provides a better experience than gene wilders performance giving willy wonka a twist that makes him unforgettable its a must see movie that will give you a few laughs and show another great performance by johnny depp
Jul 15 2022,negative,where the overall feel of the original was warm  with a charming eccentric in the main role this version is uncomfortably weird and a little disturbing   the portrayal of willy wonka looks like it was in no small part inspired by michael jackson which seems like an odd move  greatly adds to the overall disturbing  off feel of the film    wouldnt watch again
Jun 18 2022,positive,lol 01 hour and 55 minutes of funny fantasy content with johnny depp and freddie highmore and the late christopher lee as willy wonkas daddy
Jun 16 2022,positive,tim burton does not give one he went all out with charlie and the chocolate factory it is texturally delightful visually stunning much more faithful to its source terrifyingly politically incorrect and i love it
Jun 11 2022,negative,this movie is nothing compared to its original   this is an over blown and underwhelming remake  and its nowhere near as good  very disappointing to have shown to my 6 year old  we turned off half way thru and then rented the original  wow i was really disappointed  dont waste your time or your money on this film
Jun 7 2022,positive,if you loved the 1970s movie be prepared for a different tone that way you will appreciate this film for its own merits wild scenery the dakness from dahl the weirdness that a deppbutton film always has the pacing isnt always great but the extra elements of back story make for something new also oompaloompa songs are on point
Jun 5 2022,positive,i like this tim burton version
May 31 2022,positive,really enjoyable the gene wilder version was good but i found this better depp was unrecognisable as willy wonka his portrayal is how i imagine willy wonka from reading the book as a kid
May 31 2022,negative,johnny depp and tim burtons worst movie gene wilder nailed the role in the original lazy copy paste oompa loompas this did not need to happen
May 27 2022,positive,i love this movie it may be a different style than the original but its still a great movie 
May 24 2022,positive,i love how willy was so done with the kids as soon as they walked into his factory that man did not give one crap
May 23 2022,positive,i had never seen this movie before i recently watched it on netflix and i thought it was surprisingly good i had been hesitant to watch because i enjoyed jean wilders performance so much from my childhood but i thought johnny depp was an excellent willy wonka
May 23 2022,positive,this is such a good movie i have absolutely no idea why the reviews are so low it has a great underlying messages especially for children but  its still so unique with the way that it incorporates depp as willy wonka who is truly the star of the show and a classic tim burton touch all of the characters are fleshed out well and the visuals are spectacular a mustsee
May 7 2022,positive,i just love this movie so much so good in so many ways 
May 3 2022,positive,terrifying but in a good way
Apr 29 2022,positive,sonic i think im going back in the dark and i have a little
Apr 8 2022,positive,oompa loompa caries the film
Apr 5 2022,positive,i dont understand the 53 at all the one made by critics seems more reasonable for the first time ever basically this is the best kids film that ive ever seen easy
Mar 19 2022,positive,while i do prefer the original with gene wilder this was still enjoyable
Mar 5 2022,positive,really fun to watch and the tim burton feel made it so different than other movies
Feb 22 2022,positive,love it  best movie
Feb 18 2022,positive,this is in no ways a bad movie its just not as good as the previous one
Feb 1 2022,negative,a lifeless and failed attempt to recreate the magic found in mel stuarts representation the story doesnt flow the acting is bad it isnt fun or whimsical johnny depps willy wonka is a real slugworth this is just a bad movie 
Jan 13 2022,positive,i am unapologetically in love with this film many people didnt like the film because of its style and changes from the 1971 version however they failed to realize that is the whole point the original is more straight forward and this one allows tim to go full burton
Jan 10 2022,positive,johnny depp is willy wonka in tim burtons version of this movie depps  portrayal of wonka is almost of an ambiguous cartoon character more so than an eccentric chocolatier  tim burton movies are always a feast for the eyes with a little bleakness laced in    freddie highmore is very good as charlie and many burton regulars are also featured as well   fun movie but far from my favourite tim burton film
Jan 8 2022,negative,throw it away and keep gene wilder version
Dec 22 2021,positive,god this movie is so good it is so funny at some parts and it blows your mind it is a perfect mixture of everything i like
Dec 18 2021,positive,recommended for adults parents children and classrooms    when watching this movie it releases the aura of movies such as home alone capturing the essence of a lost boy in a big world on his own it brings a smile to everyones faces when they see grandpa george spring enthusiastically from his bed and embarks a long dance this movie demonstrates how being tenacious and honest brings you a long way in the world which is demonstrated in the movie as charlie bucket has been totally opposite from the rich and spoiled brats that go along with him out of all the movies ive watched so far i can admit that this one has the most persistent upcoming of the life lesson that has been so deeply engraved into the story it communicates this by showing how each egotistical and narcissistic spoiled child eventually comes upon his doom in the factory      if you are a parent reading this or any sort of guardian including teachers and mentors i would seriously recommend this film as it has strong moralist values and holds great standards for children and adults alike
Nov 20 2021,negative,the original is definitely better they make willy wonka just too creepy and not the loveable character he should be
Nov 13 2021,positive,creepy as hell at times but still okay from what it is 355
Nov 9 2021,negative,willy wonka and the chocolate factory is a blast from the past that needs to stay in the past blurring the lines between whimsy and creepy willy wonka is more dark than magical the movie is unsatisfying for adults and unsettling for younger audiences while wonkas world is imaginative it is not worth spending time there foursentenceratings
Nov 7 2021,negative,i thought i had seen the most bazaar johnny deep movies  that he finally stepped into the realm of what he was really meant to be with black mass then i tried watching this crap a new level down for the weird one
Nov 7 2021,positive,a great darker reimagining of the classic tale charlie and the chocolate factory has all the unique characteristics that tim burton fans will expect
Sep 8 2021,negative,awful on so many levels theres no contrast between charlies normal world and the chocolate factory everything is dark twisted and creepy speaking of creepy johnny depps characterization as willy wonka is at best offputting unlike gene wilder who was eccentric but at his core human depp comes across as a psychopath with no relatable human characteristics he looks at the children with at best disdain the songs are god awful being chaotic clamorous melodyless over done set pieces with awful cgi everything is always dark of course speaking of cgi theres way too much of it and the color tone for the movie is grayish blue for the most part its dismal dreary and more suited for a horror movie than a childs fantasy grandpa joe is there and has no personality or purpose in this film unlike the wonderful jack albertson performance from the original but the worst is charlie bucket i could not give a damn about this character hes not interesting hes not sympathetic hes just there the fault lies squarely on the shoulders of director tim burton he relied much too much on visual effects for entertainment and forgot to give us characters we care about as the original willy wonka gene wilder said this movie is an insult charmless and a burden to sit through
Aug 20 2021,positive,this is not a remake rather than an original version that exists outside of the first johnny depp  tim burton made a fantastic movie that expands the life of willy wonka the songs were different and great watched this movie for the last 15 years and it never gets old of course the original is better but this one doesnt deserve hate
Aug 16 2021,positive,a wonderful mix of strange and bizarre characters matched with equally strange and bizarre candies a delight to watch
Jul 26 2021,negative,just watch the part were the its a small world clone display burns up then turn it off rest of the movie is horrible
Jul 21 2021,positive,although i still prefer the gene wilder adaption i enjoyed this one as well jonny depp made me laugh so many times the one thing i dont like about it is the singing puppet scene every time i watch i have to skip past it because it is so cringey other than that i think it is a great movie
Jul 20 2021,positive,as ones of the biggest products adapted to the screen of burton this adaptation is really a success 910
Jul 17 2021,positive,this movie is way better than the other one it is more based off the book
Jul 10 2021,negative,not a very good film in its own right but i cant speak on its accuracy to the book as i havent read it if you want a better version of this story however somewhat altered i would watch the original film
Jul 7 2021,positive,looks great johnny depp is the best actor in the world
Jun 24 2021,negative,the exact same thing as the other movie still stupid
Jun 23 2021,positive,a charming movie johnny depp was fabulous and his eccentricity was creepy yet endearing also hes 42 in this and doesnt look a day over 20 what the hell that mans cheekbones could cut chocolate bars also i loved mr and mrs bucket i didnt remember them much from the book but they were delightful the acting from the child actors was very strong too
Jun 20 2021,positive,why do all the negatie reviews compare this to the gene wilder version its not the same thing stop it get some help sure the tonal shift can be quite jarring but this is a well crafted story with incredible visuals acting and direction
May 28 2021,positive,charlie and the chocolate factory is a 2005 britishamerican musical fantasy film directed by tim burton and written by john august based on the 1964 british novel of the same name by roald dahl   the storyline follows charlie as he wins a contest along with four other children and is led by wonka on a tour of his chocolate factory   the film has an original script the plot is exciting and infinitelyvariable   the film had the perfect cast the film stars johnny depp as willy wonka and freddie highmore as charlie bucket alongside david kelly helena bonham carter noah taylor missi pyle james fox deep roy and christopher lee the acting is brilliant the characters turned out to be colourful and convincing special effects are impressive   the film is really interesting suitable for fantasy and comedy enthusiasts   you shouldnt miss it
May 25 2021,positive,i saw this movie 16 years after its release i didnt expect cgi to have aged well in fact it didnt i find the plot uninspired a starving boy who becomes heir to a fortune by reconciling the chocolate mogul with his past the music is nice i liked the design of the scenography and the colors photography isnt bad either a film that in my opinion does not shine very much on the emotional side and little on the technical side
Apr 30 2021,positive,this is still one of the greatest movies from my childhood i used to watch this movie everyday when i was a kid loved it i recently watched the 1971 film and i honestly think that it was very boring dont really enjoy the gene wilder version tim burton i think did a better job at capturing the story in his style and comedy i think johnny depp was one of the best actors for the role of willy wonka hands down    the movie was funny the candy room scene looks amazing and i really enjoy the different songs that the oompa loompas sang this movie is more memorable than the gene wilder version in my opinion
Apr 12 2021,positive,much closer to the book than the older movie  approved by roald dahls wife
Apr 1 2021,positive,i felt more comfortable watching this than the original i honestly like this one more captures the imagination of kids more albeit being complete madness at times burton is a powerhouse thats fact
Mar 25 2021,positive,beautiful movie with lots of wisdom
Mar 21 2021,positive,it may be darker and less family friendly than the original but it still is great entertainment with its improvements like the effects songs and backstories
Mar 19 2021,positive,despite its magical moments and better insight into the life story of willy wonka the movie does not surpass the original
Mar 2 2021,positive,this movie very fantastic every time that iback to watch again and again i feel amazing every time i love characters design and mood of movie its wierd but beautiful
Feb 20 2021,positive,best underrated movie ever  johnny deep and tim burton not received oscar nomination for best actor and best director
Feb 17 2021,negative,its not very good  the first one makes candy seem so wonderful  this one is just dark and boring
Feb 16 2021,positive,a much more grounded version of the classic story with a delightfully bonkers performance from depp inventive recreations of the gadgets from the book more convincing oompaloompas and a whimsical and oddball score from danny elfman
Feb 14 2021,negative,the unfunniest family fantasy with a pg rating because it is less magical the worst scene is when charlie bucket and his family live in the factory for life
Feb 5 2021,positive,better than the first film but its a little bit cheesy grade almost dislike it 610
Feb 1 2021,positive,although tim burton goes a little too far with the visuals the movie provides a heartwarming darker remake that is loyal to the books
Jan 26 2021,positive,i love this film ive seen it over 10 times and its such a fun film to watch the movie has a great story a great cast and its such a sweet 115 minutes of someones time i love johnny depp as willy wonka he may not have the best perosnality but boy can johnny depp can play that character i like freddie highmore as charlie as well the directing shots are amazing and i love the opening theme as well where they show the chocolate being sold to all the countries amazing film and you cant get enough
Dec 31 2020,positive,not as good as the original
Dec 28 2020,positive,still a very good movie i love everything about it from the amazing johnny depp to the amazing soundtrack
Dec 12 2020,positive,charlie and the chocolate factory may have its charm and special effects better but nothing beats the 1971 version
Nov 23 2020,positive,would you chew a piece of gum that was the best thing you have ever had but you ultimately turn violet and disformed for life after this movie certainly not this cinematic remake that is supposed to closely follow that of the original roald dahl story will leave you speechlessor covered in trash it is every childs dream to tour a candy factory where everything is edible then there being a special prize at the end for a child who makes it let your inner child run free as well as your imagination during this film imagine drinking from a chocolate river or tasting a full course meal in a single piece of gum this bright sugarcoated twisted movie hides teaching moments behind a candy land  it shows the right and wrong way to act and ultimately how parents have failed the music in the movie is upbeat but the words have an ominous undertone the camera work certainly captures all the angles which draws you in the scenes make the child inside of you want to be in the movie yourself the overview shot of the factory is a childs dream come true the catchy songs will get stuck in your head but the words are thought provoking augustus gloop augustus gloop a great big greedy nincompoop this line personally shows why he meet this fate he was greedy and possibly not smart enough to think of the consequences of his actions  i personally love this movie because of the way the childrens manners relate to their ending the way the child who chews gum competitively chews her last piece and turns into a blueberry another being a glutton and almost drowning in chocolate because he cant stop his urge suddenly the children all start meeting their demise but in ways almost expected my willy wonka himself how did he know that only four goggles would be needed in the tv room how can he not know which key unlocks a gate in his own factory the plot along with the movie all bring together the twisted story of charlie bucket enjoy watching jonny depp be a chocolatier and deep roy be oompa loompas and realize the twisted intentions with every scene would you survive the factory
Nov 12 2020,positive,way way better and more dahl than the dull lsddriven horror ride of the original bleh but no this one is really good depp and burton clearly had loads of fun making it
Nov 12 2020,positive,honestly the only film that i like johnny depp in he made a very worthy willy wonka and was a neat adaption from the book and had very good production design from tim burton
Oct 29 2020,positive,this is the greatest movie ever conceived this movie has touched me i believe this is the third coming of christ in movie form when i first watched this film i was an ignorant little child now i have matured i understand this movies true purpose i have never seen such a good film before it was mind blowing and it cured my blindness
Oct 27 2020,positive,fits the book its based off much better than the gene wilder version i appreciate depps humor and style more the songs are better more memorable and fir the book better
Oct 26 2020,positive,as great as the 1971 version its really poor as an adaptation i get you have to make changes but that movie made so many unnecessary changes to the story and i have no idea why i originally didnt like this but it really grew on me i thought the visuals were spectacular i loved the set designs the music is fabulous and it does a great job of bringing the book to life johnny depp also grew on me i originally found him annoying but he grew on me quite a bit and the cast was pretty well done violet mike augustus veruca and charlie were all done really well but i do prefer the veruca from the 1971 version by quite a lot and all the young actors gave great performances
Oct 24 2020,negative,dont waste your time with this one watch the original one with gene wilder which is 100x better 
Oct 15 2020,positive,how not to like this movie he is incredible is the best film of 2005
Oct 13 2020,positive,i have to admit that im 28 years old and never watched that movie but im a huge johnny depp fan and it has been on my list for a long time was is the best movie ive ever seen no it was quite silly and a bit too much at times  typical wonka you know but i actually enjoyed it the ending made me super happy overall a good movie to watch when theres nothing else on tv
Sep 14 2020,negative,bad characters development tide up with a very high passing making the spectator feel a claustrophobic experience
Aug 26 2020,positive,charlie and the chocolate factory is such a good film for everyone that we mustnt forgot our family
Aug 17 2020,positive,johnny depp might just be too weird for some
Aug 9 2020,positive,this version is pretty bad for the family and johnny depps voice annoys me and tnhe opening willy wonka song is annoying as heck 610
Aug 8 2020,positive,this film is visually interesting as well as having both fun and interesting story and performances
Aug 6 2020,positive,its not the 71 movie but it has some good moments and is quite fun to watch
Aug 1 2020,positive,love roald dahl  and johnny did an amazing work as usual i dont know why people scored it low go read the book
Jul 23 2020,negative,like most burton outings charlie and the chocolate factory is a visual treat and the talented cast tries but this remake makes too many unsuccessful strange choices and fails to answer why audiences shouldnt just watch the superior 71 original instead
Jul 14 2020,positive,a dark and haunting retelling of the colorful 1971 musical adaptation that sticks closer to the source material tim burtons trademark imaginative visuals and gothic style fit perfectly well here and despite not being as whimsical as the previous adaptation it compensates with a cohesive tone an entertaining and heartfelt narrative and an exaggerated but restrained lead performance from johnny depp
Jun 28 2020,positive,this movie is definitely got the tim burton twist to it its weird in a way that you would think only tim and johnny could do    its honestly not a bad modern twist on the story but the weird can be distracting and i dont like the extended flashbacks    if you can get past that there is plenty to like and the puppet scene is a personal favorite of mine    i like it better than it is good will watch repeatedly
Jun 26 2020,negative,in a long list of terrible depp performances this might be the worst and most self indulgent
Jun 25 2020,positive,the reason why many reviews of this movie are absolutely terrible  some marking the film at only 1 or 1 and 12 stars is because of this awful notion that old movies are so much better than the remakes or that remakes are always awful now seriously anyone who has seen this cult classic remake first before they saw gene wilders is that this version of the story is far superior not only has it got draw dropping visuals and intricate set designs it creates a world of wonder and imagination watching the movie is a truly magical experience and tim burton has successfully captured mine and millions of other peoples attentions and hearts in this beautiful movie please do me a favour and do not listen to these idiotic negative reviews from morons  obviously the thickness of their skulls has restricted the movie from having any impact on their brain and unfortunately the utter delight of the movie has gone over their head with is perfect casting  johnny depps hilarious performance and his delivery of comedic lines this movie is a one of a kind it would be obvious to any individual that this movie does a thousand times more justice to roald dahls classic than its predecessor i am not asserting that the old movie is bad however i have come to understand that sometimes and especially in this case newer productions of the story have severely complemented the magic in which roald dahl told so perfectly in his story sometimes you need these new visuals and sets to achieve this magic which so often is lacking in older films while old films still hold their old charm they fail to bring this modern magic that the story needs as an avid reader i believe that there are few films that are better than the book  however this is one of them five out of five stars
Jun 25 2020,positive,depp plays wonka very well and it is very hard to tell it is him unless you look at his mouth very very good movie and highly recommend
Jun 23 2020,negative,absolute cring worthy garbage classic example that bad scripts cant be saved by good actors see game of thrones season 8 or the last jedi for more
Jun 20 2020,negative,charlie and the chocolate factory would be a more educational and valuable movie if charlie accepts the 500 at first and thats the end of the movie
Jun 20 2020,neutral,this is essentially a shot for shot reboot of the original 1971 willy wonka and the chocolate factory with tim burtons style all over it for better or worse with an unoriginal take on the narrative butchering of the music and poor cgi charlie and the chocolate factory still managed to have some fun moments but couldnt hold a flame to the original film
Jun 17 2020,negative,no pay off  no build up no thought put into the writing or music to make it coherent or lovable tim burton goes full tim burton and ignores the material and actors
Jun 16 2020,negative,an utter disgrace a failure on every level
Jun 10 2020,positive,i might have a unique opinion here by saying that i absolutely loved burtons version of charlie and the chocolate factory as someone who read the novel and watched this movie as a child i was enthralled once again by dahls imagination in this version  a perfect mix of whimsical and sinister it is no exaggeration to say that it personified some of the deadliest sins of the youth but still in a manner that is palatable and amusing depps portrayal of willy wonka of a child in a grown mans body despite being just downright weird at times is still compelling enough for your heart to be warmed by the finale i recommend this for people my age gen zmillenials whether or not youve glimpsed this during your childhood for its timeless themes that may make you reflect on your old immature self
Jun 4 2020,positive,i first saw this movie in theaters and i hated it i was a big fan of the original and found that this one was atrocious but here i am 15 years older from the original release and 5 times watching this movie under my belt i now prefer this version over the original  the theme characters set design costumes etc all work perfectly to bring the magic of the books to the screen charlie is lovable and wonka is mysterious and magical this is a feel good movie with a  wonderful message
May 29 2020,negative,the movie is half watchable but the oompaloompa song breaks are revolting the go stopper twist in willy wanka is much better than the family twist in this one
May 27 2020,positive,this movie is amazing most people who disagree with it are hung up on the nostalgia from the 1971 movie the 2005 movie stays true to the book has great visuals acting music and scripting it keeps the dark tones the book had and is more eye pleasing its a great movie and i think many should enjoy it for what it is instead of comparing it to the 1971 movie
May 22 2020,neutral,love dep love burton didnt care for this movie at all i can understand being more politically correct and steering away from little people in your cast but the same smaller guy for the oompa lommpas didnt work as well dep was creepy at best 
May 22 2020,negative,this remake of the original classic willy wonka and the chocolate factory was terrible johnny depp and the rest of the cast did a decent job in this movie the plot to the movie was weird most of the time and it wasnt really entertaining at all even johnny depp was creepy looking as willy wonka the original version is so much better than this remake if you havent seen this movie yet dont waste your time its not worth seeing
May 20 2020,positive,this was one of my favorite movies ever it may be a bit disturbing for 5 and younger but older children 8 or more will have an absalute blast with this movie everytime a child gets eliminated its just happens with a huge bang with a song that you will listen to for hours yeah there might be the backstory scenes with childwonka that were a a bit bad but the rest of the movie is pretty much a modernized willy wonka with great songs and a magical setting
May 19 2020,positive,the setting is exquisite and gorgeous and perfectly builds a fairy tale chocolate kingdom  the acting of young actors is great  reasoning subtly in fairy tales
May 17 2020,negative,this one tries to follow the book more and could have been better if depp didnt come off as a creep
May 11 2020,positive,i really liked this darker adaptation johnny depps performance is flawless and quite creepy the ending was satasfying and told a positive story of family also who doesnt love a good christopher lee performance this review would be 45 stars under only one condition get rid of the oompa loompas the songs just make my ears bleed i cant watch it without skipping the songs and any scene with an oompa loompa overall good movie but destroy the oompa loompas
May 9 2020,positive,i was impressed by how depp could change his voice and appearance to look like michael jackson not many actors can do that
May 8 2020,positive,ok charlie and the chocolate factory follows the predecessor but gives a burton twist of gothic charm and some fast pace family comedy johnny depp gives wonka another comedic moment the story is taking a turn and views how wonka became successful and where he got his workers and explains clearly who wanted his formula to me this movie couldve flopped but its happydark family charm and some comedy is closer than ever there are memorable moments where people can quote the movie and this burton charm is its own style in conclusion willy wonka and the chocolate factory is the classic for bushing the boundaries but charile and the chocolate factory brings together an awesome mix that holds the wonka and the charlie character together 710
Apr 24 2020,positive,great movie even though the original is the best seen this a few times great movie
Apr 19 2020,positive,sooooo good its darker then the other movie but still a great watch
Apr 18 2020,positive,its one of those reboots thats better than the original
Apr 17 2020,positive,a faithful and inventive adaptation combined with burtons direction augusts script the performances of the cast elfmans score rousselots cinematography lebenzons editing mcdowells production design youngs set decoration pescuccis costume design action sequences and visual effects charlie and the chocolate factory takes a more faithful approach to dahls famous novel
Apr 14 2020,positive,i watched charlie and the chocolate factory when i was 7 years old and that movie really marked all my childhood  in a good way as a great movie now i watch this and think omg why did i watched this and not harry potter but still a great movie
Apr 6 2020,positive,charlie and the chocolate factorys    fairytale like allure may be considered weird but blends burtons and dhals respective fun visions flawlessly together
Mar 22 2020,negative,extremely weak remake of a classic depp played wonka like michael jackson rather than the edgy yet lovable performance gene wilder did its cgi certainly aged poorly making the originals hold up really well the other characters were really stiff as well the only two characters i liked were veruca salt and mike teevee the others were bland and i didnt like depps creepy version of wonka the overall color scheme was also a problem being too bleak and dull compared to the originals vibrant and exciting color scheme even the oompa loompas were weak here with it being one actor copied digitally and boy does it show the original used real little people and it benefited from that because they varied in demeanor more with some also varying in size
Feb 29 2020,positive,masterpiece one of the greatest movies ever sweet treat for children and adults alike love it 
Feb 28 2020,neutral,so different from the bookmrwilly wonka has also become so much more awkward255 stars
Feb 28 2020,negative,what a bunch of offbrand garbage
Feb 23 2020,positive,this movie is worthy of a second watch for those who didnt like it the first time johnny depp takes the wonka character in a hilarious direction and the songs are great
Feb 10 2020,negative,the movie was complete garbage it was nothing like the original hated it out it was after the fact when we got to see the aftermath of everything that happened to everyone in the factory is the only thing i liked about it because it was so stupid and unlikely that happen in real life that was gross of the original movie but at least that actually made sense and had a good cast and even more lower budget for the original movie of 29 million the remake had a budget of 150 million which helped nothing it made it worse because the older movie with the smaller budget will still a hundred thousand times better than this heaping load of shit
Feb 9 2020,positive,do you know what a canary is dot png
Jan 25 2020,positive,believe it or not ive watched it many times as a kid but now 18 years for the first time as an adult and it was all weird when i was a kid i watched the film innocently dealing with everything in an unexpected and beautiful way  but now i saw that willy wonka is a goddamn psychopath and in fact everything was planned for each winner of the gondel ticket he was there making plans of how he would take each one and fuck into the factory at least charlie who was the only one really humble and deserving of the list  and thats not bad i liked it  it is even funny to observe the danger in each situation the cunning of it just waiting for the shit to happen and the oompaloompas come on theyre just awsome
Jan 18 2020,negative,its an awful remake of the original movie based on the book
Jan 5 2020,positive,it was fun to see it for the forst time
Dec 15 2019,positive,i liked how it was a pg candy movie i even liked the oompaloompa dance
Dec 5 2019,positive,way better than chicken little
Nov 30 2019,neutral,this movie is ok close to bad because of johnny depp is akward annoying cringy and way worse than the orginal willy wonka
Nov 3 2019,positive,great movie depp at his best i love the part addd about willies childhood and finally getting a family 
Nov 3 2019,neutral,augustus gloop veruca salt violet beauregarde and mike teavee are delightfully nasty and its satisfying to see them get their just desserts hehheh especially mike teavee but charlie isnt much of a character and johnny depp as willy wonka is one of the most unpleasant performances ever he ruins the movie
Oct 30 2019,negative,so scary it made poo myself and cry 1010
Oct 28 2019,positive,good for any one to watch movie
Oct 23 2019,negative,please just stick with the original book  no need to add side stories about willy wonkas childhood depps wonka doesnt have the fun eccentric personality from the book but instead just a boring awkward socially inept weirdo who doesnt care about childrens safety
Oct 20 2019,positive,with the exception of some disney stuff i am not a fan of musicals this is the non musical adaptation of roald dahls charlie and the chocolate factory it is a very good story and i liked the book it was awesome the movie was also awesome watch this if you dont like musicals but like charlie and the chocolate factory
Oct 15 2019,positive,maybe its nostalgic bias but i really like this movie i dont mind johnny depps portrayal of wonka but i do understand why people are turned off by it i also like the visual style of the movie it almost has a dr seuss vibe to it and i like how its darker than the original movie i like the original movie more but i dont think this movie is bad at all
Oct 6 2019,positive,funny and nice movie
Oct 5 2019,negative,whilst it deserves plaudits for being truer to the source material than its 1971 predecessor for me this attempt to bring the roald dahl classic into the 21st century rather than elevating the tale to new heights fell flat on its back johnny depps portrayal of willy wonka was creepy and unnecessarily juvenile and in spite of the original films inaccuracies i would take the charming enigmatic portrayal by gene wilder over depps bumbling weirdo persona any day and given that the focus is seemingly meant to be refocussed on the titular charlie his relevance seems rather diminished once he attains the golden ticket with much of the focus on wonka being a bit of a creepy weirdo and the other four kids basically being horribly unpleasant individuals with parents who dont really seem to care all that much and yes i understand thats the whole point of their characters but it just feels like tim burton is shoving this fact in our faces far more than mel stuart ever did although the writing left a lot to be desired the majority of the actors on display did do the very best with what they had to work with helena bonham carter always excels even in poorly written films and the kids were all highly competent for their young ages the big positive for me in this film is its visuals the costume designer rightfully received an academy award nomination with the vfx team receiving a bafta nod its just such a shame that it feels very much style over substance as on the surface it is a very aesthetically pleasing film i just wish there could have been more care and attention given towards the filling inside this bread the uneven narrative poor script writing and just the absolute worst choice to play willy wonka sadly drop this film down into the remainder bin
Sep 29 2019,positive,fantastic remake or should that be adaptation
Sep 14 2019,neutral,cant compete with gene wilder
Sep 11 2019,negative,poor writing directing casting cgi score and more  was this the movie that finally convinced hollywood that their faith in tim burton was misplaced  this is good mystery science theater fun
Sep 6 2019,negative,no need to remake this this is weird and unnecessary 
Sep 2 2019,positive,certain moments in the movie are just unnecessarily cringeworthy but makes up for the performance by johnny depp one thing i hated was charlie he is like jesus christ he is a sinless child he shows no greed or anything and he sucks at acting other than that its a little to be desired but overall not bad but not great its ok its an ok watch
Aug 27 2019,positive,who keeps casting johnny depp to do these wild roles i kinda feel bad for freddie because the guy looks the same as he did when he filmed this movie also grandpa is still a deadbeat
Aug 23 2019,negative,100 dreadful and make me feel physically sick had to walk out befor the kids even got into the factory the singing dolls that sung will wonka was creepy as hell  then then burst into flames this is meant to be a fantasy film full of excitment and an amazing character which gene wilder captured perfectly in the original but this is just completely dreadful no body would allow their kids near such a crazy freaky guy like mr wonka played by depp bloody hell sorry but its just terrible the whole thing
Aug 16 2019,negative,jonny deep could never copy gene wilder
Aug 16 2019,negative,i despised this remake in the sense that johnny depps performance was so overthetop annoying a total mood kill with nothing new to say drab 055
Aug 13 2019,negative,one of the shittiest movies ive ever seen periodt
Aug 10 2019,positive,featuring creative direction by tim burton a wellorganized screenplay by john august an exceptional soundtrack by danny elfman which features very entertaining songs beautiful visuals detailed and perfect costume design and excellent performances by johnny depp mostly freddie highmore david kelly and the whole cast charlie and the chocolate factory is a great movie and one more hit by burton
Aug 6 2019,positive,i love this movie is much closer to the book than the original movie i love the ending much better you actually see what happens to the children in this one plus the children are updated to modern times 
Aug 2 2019,neutral,nice story and amazing visual pictures but its for kids only nothing interesting for adult i appreciate the role of johnny depp in the movie he is so genius and he can play any character he wants
Aug 2 2019,positive,not too bad  not as much fun as the old one with gene wilder as willy wonka
Jul 22 2019,positive,its a very fun storyline and interestingly made a great childhood memory
Jul 16 2019,positive,kids love this movie
Jun 18 2019,negative,so not delightful original did a nice balance of dark and endearingthis was just unpleasant 
Jun 17 2019,negative,horrible interpretation of the character gene wilder was so much better
Jun 11 2019,negative,while i have enjoyed some of tim burtons movies from the past i was disappointed with this unnecessary remake
May 29 2019,positive,i cant believe theres people who dont like this movie one of my all time favourites 3  
May 20 2019,negative,absolutely awful this movie left me feeling like i needed to scrub my brain with bleach ill stick to gene wilder or go read the book
May 20 2019,positive,charlie and the chocolate factory is a fantasy film this movie is about a boy who wins a cupon  then he goes to the chocolate factory and he visit many  rooms the movie is for all the ages
May 15 2019,negative,absolutely certifiably crackers a creepy weird performance by depp and a typically weird delivery by oddball director tim burton as someone who loved the book as a child this film basically raped those memories id give zero stars if i could 05
May 11 2019,positive,apparently im in the minority but i loved depps performance
May 4 2019,positive,im just going to say it charlie and the chocolate factory is not only my favorite tim burton movie not only do i think its even better than the original but i think its one of the greatest movies ever made    not only is willy wonka more fleshed out as a character but its also one of the most gorgeous movies ever made every set is dripping with deliciousness and creativity its one trippy ride ill never forget
Apr 23 2019,neutral,as much as we love it original this remake is a far cry from spectacular though it does offer some nice ideas and impressive visuals on the now iconic source material it fails to truly deliver tim burtons environment does not match the book at all along with its messages plus the characters are terribly portrayed as they give lifeless performances especially johnny depp as willy wonka its a remake we didnt ask for or wanted it should be happy that it didnt tarnish the other classics legacy
Mar 28 2019,negative,well this is on the other end of the divisive side im actually shocked by how successful this was with critics the original is one of my favorite movies this however is so dark and making willy wonka resemble a known pedophile is sick by itself but no lets only have one actor play all of the oompa loompas lets get this straight tim burton loved michael jackson yet didnt like the declined of height enough to find more than one actor dont get me wrong tim burton is a personal hero but he needs to stick to stuff thats original or dark originally childhood ruined
Mar 25 2019,negative,couldnt finish
Mar 16 2019,positive,this movie isnt really a parody of the original one but i feel it like a halloween version of willy wonka and the chocolate factory i can prove it with danny elfmans outstanding score and some scenes can freak young kids out but its a good movie anyway
Mar 8 2019,negative,because of its dark nature and the despicable portrayal of willy wonka charlie and the chocolate factory has lost its uniqueness and fun
Feb 17 2019,positive,roald dahl at his best
Feb 3 2019,negative,while it shows the movie was made by a good director its still a bad movie
Jan 31 2019,positive,charlie and the chocolate factory has a strange way of telling its story but in the end it sucseeds to interest its viewers
Jan 30 2019,positive,5 out of 5 for this movie i love this movie so much and i really dont get why this movie gets a lot of hate
Dec 21 2018,positive,i loved this movie except the actors were better in the original
Dec 13 2018,positive,closer to the books so a wonderful ride throughout plus the way everything goes and is and looks and the songs oha must watch for all kids or adults if you didnt see it before
Dec 9 2018,negative,this is a remake of willy wonka and the chocolate factory seriously just lost willy wonka and the chocolate factory dont even bother with this remake oh my god this is the most horrible terrifying remake ive ever seen they took what was a whimsical and joyous movie and turned it into a horror flick that should be only played during halloween the actor thats playing willy wonka is the worst part of this movie he doesnt say much and hes creepy and the storyline is rushed i could continue to list reasons why this movie sucks and why you should just watch willy wonka and the chocolate factory only small good part of this movie is some of the flashbacks where you get to see wonkas childhood and to think what would have save this movie is a better willy wonka like robin williams or maybe will smith would have made a better willy wonka or anyone along the line of that humor and some better songs
Dec 1 2018,negative,sadly johnny depp was a terrible willy wonka just awful creepy out of place humorless jokes like your mumbling lame and constant   terrible wonka he seemed out of place and not meant to be      gene wilder played an interesting stern  clever  eccentric factory owner depp was just a boring clown weirdo playing a stupid fart joke young teenage child mind in the role of the legendary willy wonka not to be taken more than an idiotic immature teenager  with horrible social skills  running a factory cracking dull rude remarks at the kids all movie    oompa loompas were a huge letdown songs were mediocre  factory was a digitalized sham with little to praise i got no enjoyment and was frankly bored for most of the factory parts      stick to the gene wilder clever yet serious yet eccentric yet still amazing willy wonka and the chocolate factory
Nov 24 2018,positive,much better than original lots of fun
Nov 23 2018,positive,this is so underrated i actually thought it was decent
Nov 19 2018,positive,omg i love so muuuuch charlie and the chocolate factory  willy wonkas chocolate look so good  i want to taste this chocolate    i love this movie  but i think willy wonka is strange and a little bad     this movie is so perfect   my favourite character is augustin gloop  go see it guys     this movie sucks who can like this sheat lmao look at the story of this movie so worst whos these oumpa loompa  wtf
Nov 15 2018,negative,this movie is beautifully shot i think my love of the original prevents me from seeing this as its own thing it just disturbs me and i cant enjoy it
Nov 12 2018,negative,this movie is just so weird and boring
Nov 10 2018,positive,i did not become a johnny depp fan until i saw this movie i love love love it
Nov 9 2018,positive,this film is not terrible  it certainly does not beat the original and johnny depp has absolutely nothing on gene wilder however this is a creative attempt to recreate the original with the burtonesque flavour suiting the film and is both entertaining and heartfelt
Nov 2 2018,negative,this movie just proves why you dont remake a classic
Oct 26 2018,positive,a childhood favorite of mine
Oct 16 2018,positive,i thought that johnny depp was horrible as wonka but i thought that it was ok and looked great but compared to the original it does not even come close 610
Oct 6 2018,positive,charlie wins a golden ticket and goes to willy wonka  johnny depp  cholecet factory
Sep 23 2018,positive,charlie and the chocolate factory seems to have more of the roald dahl classic than the 1971 film and johnny depp brings a dark and surprising act as the role of willy wonka this film directed by the suspensful and creepy tim burton is largely mysterious and full of dark moments but it works well as an emotionally satisfying film
Sep 15 2018,negative,americanised and cheapened from the warmth and heart of the original
Aug 28 2018,negative,hated the oompa loompa  worst movie ever 
Aug 18 2018,positive,this film is awesome i loved it so did my little ones definitely recommend it xx
Aug 14 2018,positive,im really suprised but im not prepared for explosion humor and lore like that really incredible movie about a lot kinds of people
Aug 1 2018,positive,i know this movie back to front inside out i grew up with this movie and still like it a lotit tells a strange but unique story and i would consider a classic and saw before the og 1971 version which it may not live up to hence the 51 from audience but is still good to me rating71
Jul 27 2018,positive,i love this movie its great i still dont think its better than the original one with gene wilder but johnny depp is a fun replacement though 92100
Jul 1 2018,negative,depp is hit or miss and this was a big miss  just because the vision was closer to the book doesnt make it better  im sticking with gene wilder this film was an insult
Jun 30 2018,positive,gives wonka some much needed depth and is nowhere near as bad as people may tell you 
Jun 28 2018,positive,its not better than gene wilders wonka but i never expected it to be still tim burton creates a fun world here that works with tons of imagination
Jun 21 2018,negative,the genius gene wilder show the mad genius of willy wonka the great johnny depp actor makes a traumatized akward adult
May 30 2018,positive,i didnt hate it as much as i thought i woould being a huge fan of the original movie however this movie is just too long adding some unnecessary background information giving depps questionable performance way too much space the music is ok better than expected anyway and the visual effects are stunning the only thing better than the original
May 25 2018,positive,charlie and the chocolate factory was a go to remake johnny depp was pretty hilarious in this movie
May 5 2018,positive,in my personal opinion an improvement on the first movie giving us an entertaining and fun film while sustaining suspense and drama through the entire movie giving us a unique and different look into the chocolate factory revielling its dark wonders it all comes down to depp wonderfull permonance and tim burton a movie i could gladly watch over and over again
Apr 6 2018,positive,director tim burton puts a new twist on this classic roald dahl novel what does direct and zany nature though not as iconic as the original 1971 film version this version is more faithful to the original novel and puts some new twist to a classic story although johnny depps performance as willy wonka is cringeworthy the sets have that classic tim burton feel
Apr 1 2018,negative,the movie is filled with all kinds of hatred stereo typing and violence i still cant understand who is the target audience of this
Mar 26 2018,neutral,a darker more intelligent film than the original but not as fun
Mar 26 2018,positive,better than the original 
Mar 14 2018,positive,ive grown up in a time where it was an unspoken tradition to have watched the original movie adaptation of dahls classic story at least once a year if not more and fell in love with gene wilders portrayal of willy wonka as a fan of both roald dahl and his original story tim burtons interpretation supersedes mel stuarts and the powers that bes screenplay tim burtons surreal vision of the story fits perfectly with roald dahls otherworldly story telling johnny depp also delivers one of his best performances that is shadowed by viewers perspective of nostalgia i feel this version and every performance in it mirrors closer to the book than the originals whimsical incarnation
Feb 23 2018,negative,the claim is that this version follows the book more closely maybe thats accurate concerning the storyline but hardly in spirit the nasty and overbearing children who are sent off onebyone to their earned punishments appear unscathed and no worse for wear in other words no lessons learned and no redemptive value    certainly this version has all the bells and whistles but these cinematic delights cannot make up for the lack of mystic that sweeps viewers into the chocolate factory in willy wonka and the chocolate factory that is where tim burtons version comes up miles short     lest we forget johnny depp who is adored by critics for playing oddball roles i would say this version of wonka is a bust gene wilders wonka makes us want to be at the factory there is excitement around every corner because wonka makes us believe    watch the original its probably cheaper anyway
Feb 5 2018,neutral,creepywilly wonka is wonky
Jan 29 2018,positive,the definition of a good airplane movie
Jan 28 2018,neutral,tim burton has a heart of cardboard  can his friend johnny depp save him in this dark childrens remake about consumerism dunno bro ask batman that sucked too especially in the plot department this movie is worth seeing for some attractive set design ostentatious costumes and danny elfmans energetic whimsicalyetgothic musical approach parts of this film break down in to mtv style music video montage which is another sign of how shallow and distracting burton is as a creative force and storyteller he has made some some great films but this is like half of one in a sense i enjoyed the cg furry animals though
Jan 23 2018,positive,converting did a good job and this movie i think its much better than the original movie johnny depp was pretty hilarious in this movie there is a lot to laugh when you see it my favorite part is when the squirrels so audience gave it 51 i dont agree it gets higher
Jan 18 2018,positive,as a fan of the book i really enjoyed this movie as it was much closer to the original story than the one starring gene wilder i felt the casting was better and how you saw what happened to the kids when they left the factory i think this would have a much better score if people werent too busy trying to compare it to the first movie
Jan 1 2018,positive,not as good as the original willy wonka movie but was still an enjoyable film by warner bros although there are some disturbing and creepy scenes but the movie is still pretty good
Dec 26 2017,negative,bad performance by depp the music was awful cgi was overdone enjoyable for children
Dec 26 2017,positive,very creative much better than the old version
Dec 3 2017,positive,very weird but good hearted and well acted
Nov 20 2017,negative,it was like a chocolate bar first few bites are good but it gets bland real fast once you took the shiny production rapper off there wasnt much going on
Nov 12 2017,positive,ok so when this movie first came out on 2005 i was only 13 i was very excited to watch this just because i was a fan of the 1971 gene wilder film i didnt even know tim burton directed this nor that johnny depp was going to be willy wonka one day a friend of mine phoned me on a saturday morning and said that he was inviting me to watch the movie with a couple of other friends in the night at its arrival i quickly said yes at the entrance of the movie theater they were giving free wonka bars and a couple of other stuff we bought a lot of candy and a whole lot of shit we were all crazy for this movie to start it started with that creepy and dark danny elfman tune then i started having second thoughts about the movie of course i was right things were getting very mysterious at the beginning but just as i was starting to enjoy the film and get more into it johnny depp arrives at the scene and totally ruined it for me i like johnny depp and all but he willy wonka the scenery was very good but i noticed that they tried too hard to make this film colorful magical and strange which was a bit disappointing the oompa loompas could have been made better and it started to get very annoying with the flashbacks that wonka was having the music was terrible the actors were a bit good when the movie finished we all came out of the theater and didnt talked until sunday morning talking about how shitty the movie was years later i realize this movie needed a chance so i decided to watch it again it was good liked it more than before all i want to say now is that no one i mean no one can beat gene wilder he is willy wonka
Oct 28 2017,positive,its the best movie
Oct 14 2017,positive,its a fun tasty treat for all okay it might not beat the first but its loads of family fun for everybody really enjoyed depps wonka is outstanding
Oct 13 2017,positive,depp whose wonka seems to be a cross between michael jackson and the cabinet of dr caligaris somnambulist cesare delivers an engaging surface performance wish their the movie could be a part 2 then itll be amazing movies of all time of course
Sep 19 2017,positive,an absolutely wonderful movie packed with adventure
Sep 7 2017,negative,tim burton will always be one of the greatest directors ever but this remake just didnt cut it for me cast was great but it was way too juiced it didnt suck you in like the original i have watched it a few times since the release and the film does not get any better
Sep 4 2017,positive,i remember seeing charlie and the chocolate factory on tv when i was 10 years old not really giving a crap about the gene wilder movie at the time i was enthralled by what it had to offer sparking my interest in tim burton for the first time despite having previously seen his version of alice in wonderland and it also made me want to read roald dahls books and i read most if not all of his childrens books looking back on this movie now i still dont think its by any means terrible people are just blinded by nostalgia and i think they were expecting a remake of the willy wonka  the chocolate factory i admit its not a true classic unlike its 1971 counterpart and the oompa loompa songs are fun albeit forgettable johnny depps no wilder either however i still like this film thanks to tim burtons trademark stunning visuals increased faithfulness to its source material compared to the classic movie that dahl hated danny elfmans score and dark tone come on people i hear dark chocolate has half a dozen  1 healthy benefits freddie highmore is cute playing charlie whatever happened to him famous child actors such as highmore and dakota fanning never appear on the big screen anymore if the chocolate factory were an amusement park then id be more than willing to pay the price of admission the glass elevator looks awesome so yeah charlie and the chocolate factory may not have the charm of the 1971 classic but its visuals score and burtons pure imagination make it an entertaining diversion for anyone who enjoys dark chocolate and are more into stories that are faithful to their source material
Sep 2 2017,positive,tim burton made a good movie that is a classic and such a silly movie i thought johnny depp did a good job in this movie so its a good remake of the 1970 the songs where good and it is a good comedy you will laugh away i know i do i remember reading the book to this movie and its the same as the movie my favorite line in the movie is daddy i want a squirrel     this remake of charlie and the chocolate factory  is better then the 1970 movie 1970 was just ok
Aug 10 2017,positive,one of the rare scenarios where the reboot is better than the original
Jul 20 2017,positive,charlie and the chocolate factory was a really interesting film to rewatch because only when your an adult does the creepiness really stand out no film makes two audiences feel quite so different as charlie  the chocolate factory does magical for kids downright weird for adults and thats how charlie and the chocolate factory is supposed to be its the best part about the film it features great character arcs the acting in charlie and the chocolate factory is fantastic johnny depps portrayal of wonka is spot on for those familiar with the book charlie and the chocolate factory is odd but its very good you find yourself cascading down the chocolate river before you know it
Jul 18 2017,positive,tim burton isnt a very good director he cares more about visuals and eccentric characters as demonstrated back in mars attacks and the 2001 planet of the apes remake i understand that charlie and the chocolate factory had to do things differently than from the 1971 classic but on the other hand this movie was almost the exact same as the book
Jul 15 2017,positive,even though some disagree i liked burtons style in this classic better than the 1971 version
Jul 13 2017,positive,its full of visual thrills quirky humor and reaches for heart but its attempt at extending dahls story to make a more threedimensional willy wonka falls a little flat and johnny depp gives one of his most wild and random performances thats rather hitormiss
Jul 9 2017,positive,loved it so much the bad kids are the best
Jul 4 2017,negative,poorly acted and poorly scripted without any of the charm of the book or gene wilder movie johnny depp is written as an infantile manipulative meanie rather than a zany inventor with any depth the supporting characters have a lot of trouble with their accents and other than the main character are really poorly done one off jokes the dentist backstory is unnecessary and tries to add pop psychology where it doesnt help the story or provide interest or effectits sort of pretty if you like shiny plastic dont waste your time or money
Jun 26 2017,positive,i like  this movie
Jun 14 2017,positive,ill always have a soft spot for this movie
Jun 5 2017,negative,its not really my style of movie but im sure a lot of people like it the ending was too abrupt and it never really felt like anything was actually happening like everything was leading up to something big but then it just ends you are left feeling unfulfilled
Jun 1 2017,neutral,failing to live up to the magic of the 1971 film charlie and the chocolate factory doesnt engage or entertain as willy wonka should
May 25 2017,positive,only one word to describe the moviedelicious
May 11 2017,positive,im just going to say it charlie and the chocolate factory is not only my favorite tim burton movie not only do i think its even better than the original but i think its one of the greatest movies ever made not only is willy wonka more fleshed out as a character but its also one of the most gorgeous movies ever made every set is dripping with deliciousness and creativity its one trippy ride ill never forget    1010
May 6 2017,positive,charlie and the chocolate factory isnt a terrible film it has bad qualities but it has good ones as well burtons vision ruins the tone of the film but its undeniably fun to watch the screenplay for the rest of the actors isnt terrible but burton tries too hard to make the film darker and appealing to the adults in the audience and forgets all about what the main market is the kids and i dont know what the screenwriters were thinking when they wrote johnny depps lines but they failed miserably at whatever they were trying to accomplish the story is closer to the source material than the 1971 adaptation of the novel thanks to that the film isnt a complete misstep
Apr 5 2017,negative,johnny depp went from a badass pirate to an emo willy wonka i dont understand the 83 why critics this is a terrible remake
Apr 2 2017,positive,this is a much creepier version of the iconic childrens story johnny depp is just weird although he looks good and freddie highmore is always fantastic its  directed in typical tim burton style and its dark and a bit evil this is not the happygolucky musical that starred gene wilder in fact theres hardly a musical number to be seen except some bizarre oopmpa loompa staged scenes it always seems like everyone was on some interesting drugs when you watch a burton film
Mar 28 2017,positive,burton updates this classic tale to a visually stunning dark humor depps acting is so weird and so right its mesmerizing throughout
Mar 11 2017,positive,i didnt find a terrible movie as many stated here the acting is very solid and johnny depp portrayal of willy wonka is the highlight the lesson taught in the movie is inspiring and heartwarming although it is not at the same level of the original film its a different view of it and a nice one
Feb 27 2017,positive,not terrible but not amazing either
Feb 1 2017,negative,a stupid and unnecessary remake of the original the über cringe was painful
Jan 17 2017,negative,a lame remake if you want to call it that
Jan 14 2017,positive,probably the best movie i have ever seen besides the lego movie and the wizard of oz it brings back nostalgic memories from when i was a kid watching this movie every day
Jan 10 2017,positive,despite feeling like a trip to tim burtons neverland ranch this visually stunning adaptation more faithful to the source material is an experience all its own
Jan 7 2017,negative,horrible for anyone that grew up with the original   why they remake such classics is a mystery to me my kids even prefer the original johnny depp plays his usual weird character and is creepy the kids other than charlie are brats  same as the first  but much more annoying do your children a favor and show them the original
Dec 30 2016,positive,its good movie to watch
Dec 30 2016,positive,is it wrong that i actually like this version as much as the original i mean yeah johnny depp is no gene wilder but the storys more loyal to the original book this time and the flashback scenes and most of the visual effects are an improvement
Dec 21 2016,positive,charlie and the chocolate factory is directed by tim burton and it stars johnny depp and freddie highmore in a musical fantasy film about wily wonka giving 5 golden tickets to random kids to go to his factory for a tour i havent watched this in a while and since i reviewed the original i figured i should just get it over with and see how it holds up which the remake actually does for the most part that is the acting from the kids and their parents are pretty solid and the effects look better than the original it has some differences in there from the original whether theyre good or bad the songs by danny elfman are catchy and memorable although nothing beats the original with the songs the production designs look creative and imaginative and it does a good job of portraying the financially unstable family that tries to make the best of the situation now lets get to johnny depps performance people are either loathing it or just find it enjoyable to watch i get why the movie portrayed him as that way because hes a manchild that had family problems which caused him to act that way for my own opinion on this the only time he did shined in this and actually give a good performance is the last 5 minutes of the film where he can still act like a manchild while not being awkward about it during the film when hes in it however hes so awkward in it that im just not liking what hes doing in his act and its not funny except for a chuckle here or there from him doing something offbase in something like the original gene wilder basically acted like a bit of a sociopath when messing with the kids and its hilarious to watch so when comparing to the remake being a manchild doesnt really make a good substitute for it i didnt really care for the fact that it was more about willy wonka than charlie despite the fact that his name is in the title and what they developed in there was ok but not really needed the oompaloompas dont look as memorable in this as the original does even though the actor did a good job being all of them i like the child characters in there as they are dislikable but not to the point that its too much as you can see that thats how they were raised what i didnt like however was that charlie himself is too likable in this when in the original he has some disadvantages to himself that makes him more relatable and give it more of a thought about whos going to win with this however he doesnt do one wrong thing and it seem more obvious and predictable that way making him a onenote character i dont know maybe it shouldve been a bit more similar to the original where it doesnt spend any character development on wonka as we like to imagine what hes like and not also know where the oompaloompas come from i still do like the movie more than i thought of it based on tim burtons adaptations from remakes and tv shows but compared to the original charlie and the chocolate factory isnt as good as willy wonka and the chocolate factory
Dec 18 2016,positive,this was pretty decent its hard to not compare it to the original but if you judge this movie as its own its really not bad
Dec 12 2016,positive,i like it so much i mean the movie
Dec 11 2016,positive,thanks to tim burtons inventive direction and johnny depps terrific interepetation this new charlie and the chocolate factory becomes an entertainning and enjoyable film
Nov 21 2016,neutral,not any where near as good as the first one sorry johnny
Nov 15 2016,positive,a fantastic movie with a very important moral dont spoil your kids  youll be surprised or something like that or keep your expectations low  you will be surprised  
Nov 10 2016,neutral,tim burton has officially become full of himself with this wellmeaning but flawed remake of a beloved classic
Nov 3 2016,positive,charlie and the chocolate factory is a very respectable film that does have its issues such as the lack of a darker tone and a mostly very annoying soundtrack but the characterization and storytelling are both excellent here the flashback structure is well handled the humor is great and the visual effects are expectedly terrific but johnny depp is the most memorable aspect here whereas gene wilder was more sinister and memorable depp is funnier and more campy and ultimately both willy wonkas are excellent and both movies are really good with this one being one of the better films from burton and one of his most underrated
Nov 2 2016,positive,noveltomovie burton prays on the beastly stereotypes vultures of mankind a fantasy adventure with not just familyregards also twisted sickness and nevermindness towards the dirt of society depp acts like a psychwarded michael jackson with no relations to anyone going out of his comfort zone to find a heir to settle his factorys future
Oct 20 2016,positive,roald dahls morbid bitterwseet classic tim burtons colorful imaginative visual aesthetic and johnny depps best michael jackson impression were destined to meet
Oct 18 2016,positive,even  better than the original film
Oct 8 2016,positive,a great feel good film with a stellar cast that includes depp lee and carter all in great roles the songs are great and the jokes are funny one of depps best roles for sure it has a good lesson of morals and themes of family loyalty and respect a film for kids and adults
Sep 28 2016,positive,this is really delicious like chocolate
Sep 13 2016,positive,take a moment to pretend the 1971 version didnt exist putting aside my bias look at this movie on its own its a beautiful sight to see given the amount of detail that was put into it the actors clearly give it their all to portray their characters in their own ways that reflect who they are compared to gene wilders performance depp is vastly different but in the best ways its a fresh performance that leaves many feeling uncomfortably giggly in a good way this is a movie burton did right a movie thats gonna stick in peoples heads for a long time is it different than the original yeah but thats not bad theyre both perfect films in different ways telling the story in two distinctive but brilliant ways look at it on its own and its a perfect adaptation look at it side by side and its still an admirable movie
Sep 8 2016,positive,a sweet story surrounded by the taste of sweet protagonists
Sep 6 2016,negative,poor oddly grim reimagining of the classic book1971 film
Sep 3 2016,neutral,i respect the fact that burton was trying to make something much closer to dahls novel than the 70s adaptation but he gets lost in the visuals and depps misguided weirdness also the attempt to give wonka a backstory especially one this disappointing was a critical error
Sep 1 2016,neutral,its harmless mostly
Aug 29 2016,negative,horribly lame remake never shouldve been made depp at his most annoying awful choice to use wacko pervo jacko as the source for his wonka
Aug 26 2016,positive,a tim burton masterpiece a unique idea crazily put together by master burton and the script  that was just awesome and the acting  johnny depp is the best  this movie is artwork
Aug 20 2016,positive,while missing some of the charm of the original this film shows the flaws in each child better and has a better ending though the music isnt as memorable than the 1971 film
Aug 7 2016,positive,i know that the 1971 musical was unfaithful to the book but i did much prefer that version to this wellintentioned but somewhat disappointing effort from tim burton the director of batman and edward scissorhands and this adaptation was in some way more unfaithful in spirit than the 1971 film the film does have some lovely sets and inventive visuals the boat scene is fun if not as much as in the wilder version a great job is done with the veruca saltsquirrel scene and i liked the performances of helena bonham carter david kelly and freddie highmore but i was disappointed with johnny depp as willy wonka he just lacked the charm and grace gene wilder brought to the character and i dont think roald dahl intended a characterisation that was more michael jackson than willy wonka some of the cast overact especially the girl who plays veruca salt even for the character the spiteful spoilt brat act was way overdone i liked the music score by danny elfman which is filled with whimsy and appealing oddballnessi much prefer his edward scissorhands and nightmare before christmas scores however but the oompa loompa songs were rather annoying with none of the noisy melodies memorable and were shot like a music video tim burton evidently tried to make the story darker and in some respects to the book it didnt quite work a good example was the case of the additional character of dr wonka as much as i like christopher lee and he did perform well but his character was unnecessary and the script with some overexplanatory narration lacked the sparkle of the 1971 film consequently the grandparents did bring some comedy and the movie does start off well but the unfaithfulness of the last half meant that the whole film felt rushed and lacking in charm and magic which the wilder had aplenty 610 bethany cox
Aug 6 2016,positive,tim burtons rendition of charlie and the chocolate factory is much darker less sweet and very satisfying  this material plays to its directors strengths
Aug 6 2016,negative,really poor attempt at the classic novel i appreciate the change on the adaptation tim burton really took chances to make the story his own with his own visual style it didnt really work for me and seriously lacked the charm of the original
Aug 5 2016,negative,an absolute disgrace to the original depp isnt even close to mastering willy wonka as gene wilder did horrible film if you want to watch willy wonka and enjoy a lifetime supply of chocolate watch the original movie
Jul 10 2016,positive,well this was quirky movie
Jul 5 2016,negative,tim burton how dare you
Jul 3 2016,neutral,i wasnt necessarily a fan of depps depiction of willy wonka but he looked fantastic  the makeup and the teeth are amazing  across the board the coloring makeup sets and costumes are stunning  one major exception to the stunning visuals is the cgi on the childrens characters  seeing violet flip out of the factory was embarrassingly unbelievable  also i thought the songs were weak  the only element more forgettable than the songs was the duplicate oompa loompa characters  just because you can use digital effects to do something doesnt mean you should
Jun 25 2016,positive,charlie and the chocolate factory is an hilarious and adventurous movie you get to go inside willy wonkas chocolate factory and it is amazing the plot of this movie is brilliant i would very much suggest this movie
Jun 18 2016,positive,this was a nice book i read and was a part of my childhood and in 2005 the movie came out and i watched it and it was so good so the creators of this movie thank you
Jun 3 2016,neutral,although more faithful to the original novel and creative with lively visuals it lacks the joy excitement and sentiment of its predecessor burtons bleak version has no morals sullen characters who are unmoved by wonkas factory which rubs off on the audience and a bizarre wonka rendition by depp that has none of the charm or charisma of wilders
May 27 2016,positive,great remake to the original
Apr 17 2016,positive,i love the movie its brilliantly cast and the set pieces are great too i like that its closer to the source material but it loses its charm towards the end and i think johnny depp although hes a great actor isnt the best person for the part of willy wonka still a great movie and ill defiantly watch it again
Mar 22 2016,negative,tim burtons charlie and the chocolate factory is proof that closer to the book does not always mean better movie the films overblown distractingly odd style is only overpowered by johnny depps bizarre and unfitting michael jackson impersonation
Feb 27 2016,negative,tim burton must really have felt comfortable being able to completely unleash his kitschycandycoloured world for once too bad that it makes for a movie suitable almost exclusively for 13yearolds and under
Feb 27 2016,positive,not as good as the original
Feb 27 2016,positive,the best part is the oompa loompas songs are all different
Feb 5 2016,positive,charlie and the chocolate factory is another crazy funny and visually exciting film from tim burton
Jan 31 2016,negative,i like johnny depp but he really shouldnt have played willy wonka
Jan 28 2016,positive,this movie is better than the original one johnny depp does a good job of playing willy wonka and he is sarcastic at times i like verruca how she is so demanding and wanting everything to go her way and saying daddy i want a squirrel i all so like violet  violet was so sarcastic and a bit of a show off at times its funny how verruca ended up in the garbage shoot and same with her dad and i like how violent trend blue and was so flexible i like towards the end of the movie you could see violet all blue and flexible you could see verruca and her father filled with garbage and you could see mike tv tall and thin as for a gustus he is filled with chocolate but i said to my self that was their penalty except for charlie because he won  this is a funny movie to see family and kids will like this movie
Jan 17 2016,negative,those that refer to this film as somehow dark fail to see beyond burtons admittedlytalented visual style to the fairly generic emotional content in the original adaptation wilders eerie calm was far darker than any strange visuals or quirky delivery depp could muster under burtons direction as a standalone it is funny and intriguing but ultimately unnecessary
Jan 16 2016,positive,joyfully manic visually stunning and faithful to the source material tim burtons update of willy wonka successfully captures the heart and soul of the original film while still adding a few new ideas of its own
Jan 7 2016,positive,this is an must see movie
Dec 30 2015,positive,wow what a different take on the original as well as the book this is what i like to see out of a remake enough differences to establish as a different film the effects were great as well as the acting johnny depp is androgynous and creepy as willy wonka but the back stories are utterly fascinating and very well executed in a way i preferred this one to the gene wilder one maybe due to less singing and more creativity some of the elements closer to the book were so simply because of the advancement of technology i mean the original willy wonka and the chocolate factory featured a handful of orange skinned oompa loompas who all sang the same song all the time but deep roy does an excellent job in his many parts as the oompa loompas who are much less frightening than their sixties creepy counterparts
Dec 27 2015,positive,j really like this movie a lot
Dec 18 2015,positive,charlie and the chocolate factory is a faithful reimagining of the now classic willy wonka and the chocolate factory tim burton puts his signature flair on the wellknown story and characters while johnny depp is brilliant as wonka i really enjoyed this film
Dec 2 2015,positive,charlie and the chocolate factory was an awesome movie and i would give it a very high rating tim burton did a stupendous job modernizing the movie and casting a great cast which portrayed their characters very well the punishment of naughty children was clearly shown in the story line along with the perfect amount of humor added into the dialog  the visuals were amazing with the chocolate river and just the whole setting of the different factory rooms the most outstanding part was using only one man to play all those oompa loompas and going above and beyond to make sure you could not tell i would recommend this movie to any family
Nov 30 2015,negative,with dutch subtitles this was a bit silly calling charliesjakie  story was sweet  but only charlie and his family were lovely  a couple of laughssomdvd
Nov 14 2015,negative,i watched this again recently due to its addition to netflix i usually go into a bit of detail for reviews but for this one i just have one word    boooooooooooooo
Nov 8 2015,positive,tim burton obviously
Oct 22 2015,negative,one of the worst remakes ever made
Oct 17 2015,negative,the new material is far from the willy wonkas lighthearted story and musical catchyness
Oct 8 2015,negative,visually as bright as i remember the original being when i was young a bit more dark in humor and too flashy  i have to say not nearly as good as the original
Oct 8 2015,negative,even if you were to take the original classic out the equationcharlie and the chocolate factory is a cringe worthy mess despite its fantastic special effects
Oct 7 2015,neutral,follows the book very well except for the parent problem that mr wonka has developed in this storyline also wonka and his oompahloompah crew were portrayed to be of a sinister nature and while this a cool style to be expected from tim burtons work it didnt fully capture the original confident sternyetcaring character that loudly voiced and insisted the factory guests not get into trouble
Oct 4 2015,positive,charlie and the chocolate factory is your pretty standard tim burton adaptation filled with hints of comedy and horror but stuffed with imagination tim burton seems very hit or miss the audience can either catch on and enjoy the ride or not understand what is provided and feel a disconnect reviews on burtons movies really cant do justice because of how the enjoyment level of his movies vary from person to person even more than normal    i give charlie and the chocolate factory an a for effort the imagination was off the charts and how they displayed that in visual form was stunning johnny depp was amazing in this movie and gave one of the best performances of his career playing such an enigma such as willy wonka is nearly impossible but depp pulled it off i enjoyed most of the comedy and really enjoyed alot of the dark humor in this movie it doesnt feel out of place and really adds to the environment surrounding this movie    but still even with all these amazing things i cant call this movie a classic in my opinion this movie felt almost held back in so many ways even with such oddball ideas being played in this movie it felt so predictable it felt like this story took such little risks for what it couldve been instead of spreading an extremely deep message the movie seems almost basic i personally wouldve liked to have seen more of a dark movie in more aspects than just the comedy  not everything needed to end happy not everything had to work out    another reason for this basic feeling was the characters the characters flaws were obvious from the start and didnt provide anything new or worthwhile to this movie the audience couldnt connect to any of the characters due to how extreme they were even if the characters were more relatable this movie gave us no time to learn or connect with any of the characters there was no development in any of the characters except for willy wonka and it was such a shame    so in conclusion when you look at what this movie couldve been it turns out to be disappointing and almost mediocre however for what it is it turns out pretty good and is just fun  but
Oct 2 2015,positive,quite good but with the biggest exception being johnny depp playing the inventive character he lacks the lovable charm that willy wonka had in the original film and while some of his actions and sayings were laughoutloud funny some of his parts just werent well directed nor much amusing while this amount of scrumptious chocolaty and candy sweetness changes its name to charlie and the chocolate factory i felt that in the middle of the film there wasnt much emphasis on charlie himself although giving the biggest role to willy wonka himself was a pretty good plus on the positive side though the movie was neatly well crafted for a remake and the stunning visuals and special effects were charming i also liked how it had a more indepth tale of wonkas back story and a much heartfelt ending enough like the first film for the most part this film relates well to the modern age and ill bet its a definite treat when seen on bluray either kind of quality though the ideas from the classic original film will still remain the most popular kudos to the overall directing and the special effectsset artists
Sep 23 2015,negative,probably johnny depps worst performance charlie and the chocolate factory is another on the list of over the top unnecessary tim burton reimaginings the film is nice to look at but sucks all of the fun and message out of the original while making the willy wonka character seem awkward uninterested and all around hard to watch
Sep 12 2015,positive,im glad critcs appreciate it going by the score here as i dont understand the lack of audience support yes its a remake of a good film but that doesnt automatically make it terrible i think its a very enjoyable film and tim burton does very well mixing his style with the quirkiness of this story i loved this as a kid and enjoy it now  also thank you danny elfman for another great soundtrack
Sep 4 2015,negative,everyone involved in the making of this movie should be shot in the dick

Aug 15 2015,positive,theres a spookycreepyweird feeling which at first i did not like but as the movie goes on it sort of grows on you
Aug 11 2015,positive,any time i watch this im not sure how i feel about it afterwards
Aug 9 2015,positive,johnny depp changes it all by petty mistake
Jul 30 2015,positive,a bit too dark for kids yet a terrific journey back to the childhood
Jul 2 2015,negative,if youre someone who is brand new to the story of willy wonka and charlie then this is just a plain bad film if youve seen the 70s version with wilder then this is an abomination ugly angry and horrifically unfunny its like tim burton barfed out some bad cgi and try to pass it as entertainment
Jun 28 2015,positive,i have seen this movie a bunch of times  it is a great movie  i love the  part where she  turned into a giant blueberry i dont know the names of the actors but there good

Jun 22 2015,positive,i will love this forever
Jun 22 2015,positive,tim burtons charlie and the chocolate factory is absolutely fantastic until we enter the factory it goes a little downhill from there mainly because johnny depp is so frickin creepy then again roald dahls story has always been a little creepy the idea that a group of bratty children getting locked in a factory with a man and his oompa loompas    if you ignore the miscast depp youll really enjoy this film visually its absolutely breathtaking and it has plenty of heart freddie highmore is delightful as charlie bucket
Jun 21 2015,positive,i watched this movie when i was 8 years old and i still love this movie johnny deep is doing good as willy wonka  im giving this movie 55 a love
Jun 12 2015,positive,one of the most unique movies i have ever seem
Jun 7 2015,positive,although closer to the source material depp doesnt bring as much as gene wilder did to the wonka character
Jun 7 2015,negative,while i enjoy tim burton pieces  this just didnt do it for me   nobody can beat gene wilder and the original classic
May 26 2015,positive,its about family first love it
May 26 2015,positive,charlie and the chocolate factory lets you have your wonka bar and eat it too far more hilarious visually stunning and faithful to the book than willy wonka and the chocolate factory tim burtons work is a masterpiece
May 22 2015,positive,have you seen charlie and the chocolate factorythe best thing about  the film is the chocolate and the sweets from the factorythe ompaloompas music was wonderful and funnythe only bad thing was the lenghtit was too longthe special effects were brilliantand johnny deep didnt look like himselfthis is an amazing thingi recommend it to you
May 14 2015,positive,the vision and story match with dahls book however johnny depps wonka couldnt be more out of place  
May 11 2015,positive,another tolerable burtondepp collaboration nobody beats gene wilder though
May 9 2015,negative,probably the worst tim burton film its simply not a patch on the original this is dark bland and scary
Apr 30 2015,positive,a great darker adaptation of the book that adds elements of superb humor selfconsciousness and family values
Apr 26 2015,negative,42615 this film made me not want to like it  i liked he first section about charlie but by the time they got to the factory i started liking it less and less  i just cant stand johnny depps portrayal of willy wonka  he is really annoying and fake to me  that pretty much ruined it  it is a decent story a classic but johnny depp ruined it for me
Apr 21 2015,positive,charlie and the chocolate factory is a good old movie its the best old movie everâ
Apr 5 2015,positive,benefited with an excellent performance from johnny depp and enhanced with a touch tim burton charlie and the chocolate factory is an entertaining trip to the eccentric world of willy wonka which definitely surpasses the original movie
Mar 20 2015,positive,better than the original version
Mar 13 2015,positive,johnny depp gives his best career performance in his turn as willy wonka tim burton brings his flare for film making staying more strictly to the book compared to its predecessor with gene wilder catchier music and better acting
Mar 12 2015,positive,i love johnny depp so this movie was a mustsee i love all the color and everything about it 
Mar 11 2015,positive,slightly better than the original in my opinion with the same warm moral feelings and somewhat superior acting due to its budget and slicker appearance
Mar 1 2015,positive,best one great music
Feb 26 2015,positive,this is a good adaptation of roald dahls book but the soundtrack from the original movie is glaringly missing when they enter the room with the chocolate waterfall i couldnt help but hum pure imagination and wish for gene wilder to appear
Feb 26 2015,negative,i loved the original movie
Feb 25 2015,positive,i gotta admit i actually like this version of charlie and the chocolate factory though the original is definitely better i like it because its quite visually aesthetic charlie is relatable enough and depp is committed to the role i think those who didnt see the original will like it better though
Feb 18 2015,negative,as a remake it it pretty bad but the effects ware good i say  go see the 1971 film willy wonka and the chocolate factory if you havet
Feb 13 2015,negative,i admire tim burton for his ambition to stick with the original story and thats cool here it is incredibly dark and mean spirited which doesnt hold up to the original from 1971 the kids just slap them across the face for being so ignorant damn
Feb 12 2015,positive,performances and direction are what lead this film into mediocre territory freddie highmores squeeky clean almost empty depiction is annoying and johnny depps role as wonka keeps the zaniness at a high but throws out the warmth and humanity that made gene wilders original perfomance loveable and enjoyable making depp seem just plain creepy while tims signatures are all over the place his usual dementedness lacks the relateability that made his past works so timeless
Feb 1 2015,negative,terrible johnny depp has completely lost it
Jan 31 2015,positive,better than the original and makes ur mouth water just watching it
Jan 29 2015,neutral,too strange for its own good with too little emphasis on the book at its heart full review later

Jan 24 2015,positive,its one of my favorite exciting movies
Jan 23 2015,negative,will never be as good as the original movie especially dislike the digitally duplicated oompa loopmas
Jan 18 2015,negative,sort of tries to teach lessons but its too creepy and just not worth my time
Jan 17 2015,neutral,had a few good lessons but creepy and overall not worth my time
Jan 10 2015,negative,this insulting adaptation of the classic story turns willy wonka into a pedophile and turns the beautiful setting into a dark boring place
Dec 31 2014,negative,an awful update of a timeless classic
Dec 30 2014,positive,wheres the tunnel with the rooster getting his head chopped off
Dec 24 2014,negative,an insult to the book the 1971 movie and fans of the story this hollow remake offers very little in the entertainment department
Dec 7 2014,positive,dear mr burton the children of america off you their sincere congratulations for making a film guaranteed to give them nightmares willy wonka is far from like able i understand that in the books willy was a bit more terrifying than gene wilders portrayal but tim burton again takes things to far from annoyingasheck oompa loompas to an almost entirely cgi augustus gloop burtons take on an old classic fails to capture the joy and wonder of the film it remakes the film has good qualities but they are outweighed by the bad i disagree with the decision to give wonka a proper backstory in the book wonka was fascinating because we didnt know why or how he was so psychotic danny elfmans oompa loompa songs will have many running for the ear plugs     after watching this film you will begin to compulsively check your kids halloween candy for razor blades and poison dont waste your time with one of burtons worst
Nov 30 2014,positive,charlie and the chocolate factory  hana kobayashi    when i watched charlie and the chocolate factory i was impressed with the colorful and musical world of the chocolate factory i got drawn to tim burtons artistic world i remember i laughed loudly at the world and characters created by tim burton this is the most wonderful in the movies i have watched i totally recommend this movie    the original story of charlie and the chocolate factory is written by roald dahl then it was released as a movie directed by tim burton in 2005 johnny depp acts a role of willy wonka the owner of the chocolate factory he often appears in tim burtons movie edward scissorhands alice in wonderland dark shadows and five more movies they have an exquisite combination this movie received a family movie award in peoples choice awards    the story is that a boy who had lived poorly with his family got one of the five golden tickets to the chocolate factory with his luck willy wonka dropped out other four greedy children while the factory tour oompa loompa employees of the chocolate factory sang snd danced each time the greedy children was dropped out their singing and dancing are very ironical it is one of the most interesting points of this movie     in the chocolate factory we can see a lot of colorful and beautiful scenes and sense of tim burton it may be fun to watch not only the story but also the vivid representation this movie also contains elements of family loves or morals you should watch it  you must be able to enjoy this movie with your family or friends
Nov 30 2014,positive,good  but the original is better

Nov 6 2014,negative,was liking it then it went downhill so fast i switched it  over
Nov 2 2014,positive,a kids movie tim burton style really magical in a gloriously weird way
Oct 26 2014,negative,37    i know some people enjoy this film but i just found it a gross and scary retelling of the 1971 original which i am not a fan of and every character is an unlikeable little bitch the only saving grace is the visuals which do look very nice but this is to be expected for a tim burton film
Oct 24 2014,negative,remake of the original
Oct 21 2014,positive,i feel no one understands between a adaptation and a remake tim burton is not remaking the same movie from 1971 hes making a movie that  im sad to say this but sorry actually following and respects the book even roald dahl hated the 1971 for many reasons this is a better adaptation then other but hey dont take my word read the book or look into yourself
Oct 18 2014,positive,this movie is magical for families tim burton and johnny depp equally wow the audience once again the comedy and family heart take the film to the next level of cinema
Oct 11 2014,positive,i love the classic willy wonka 1971 but this was also nice  great cast darker tone and music due to tim burton and danny elfman but that is to be expected  a decent remake but nothing can replace the original  this is a good addition
Oct 10 2014,positive,the film did good for a remake but lacks the talents of the original in this tim burton film which is a more darker mood of the plotline
Oct 10 2014,negative,the true magic in this film are freddie highmore and johnny depp because all the rest is annoying predictable boring and with an horrible script
Oct 6 2014,positive,do yourself a favor and forget the gripes about depp as wonka the standard for the role is that you should be intrigued i believe i was
Oct 2 2014,positive,childhood memories
Sep 30 2014,positive,same story retold only good bit was johnny depp acting
Sep 20 2014,positive,far superior to the original and not just visually  depp was perfect for the role not dark and creepy like the original  freddie highmore was brilliant as charlie  the flashbacks to wonkas childhood made the movie for me
Sep 18 2014,positive,good grific funny but not as good as the orignal
Sep 16 2014,positive,you know ever since i was a kid ive always been entranced by otherworldly and unorthodox childrens movies and this one was no exception i really like this movie despite its misunderstanding of the tone in the original thats just tim burtons style though he takes the bright happy ideas and adds in a dark undertone to them im such fan of his so you bet ill eat that up
Sep 14 2014,neutral,it bounces between an enjoyable dark twist and tim burton selfindulgence
Sep 9 2014,positive,the movie boils down to a really well done johnny depp character and a serviceable child actor despite depps excellent comedic timing and the suspense created by the dark tones their isnt too much to hold you in had the story continued down its early darker tones i might have enjoyed it even more
Sep 8 2014,positive,i love this movie because i like chocolatethis stormy give me a lesson not to be arrogant and greedy like two little girl my favorite character is the character of a boy named charlie bucket who have properties such as baikcerita imagination in a dream thats why i imagined how exciting it is when they are in place the most frightening character is willy wonka i love that story

Aug 10 2014,positive,johnny depps fantastic performance as willy wonka makes you forget that condescending wonka even exists
Aug 10 2014,negative,this movie is an abomination its an insult to the original film terrible acting by everyone including depp cant imagine a much poorer portrayal of wonka ridiculously bad
Aug 8 2014,positive,first time you watch it its great but then it just gets old
Aug 3 2014,negative,very poor remake of a classic

Jul 28 2014,positive,so so but still creepy but not as creepy as the old one
Jul 27 2014,positive,charlie and the chocolate factory is the book come to life love it
Jul 24 2014,negative,this movie was an absolute peice of fucking shit the original was one of my favourite and my childhood revolved around it  now the studio fucking releases this rushed peice of crap just to pinch a few notes from your pockets
Jul 24 2014,negative,the true magic in this film are freddie highmore and johnny depp because all the rest is annoying predictable boring and with an horrible script
Jul 23 2014,neutral,this movie was just weird for me i didnt really enjoy it like i get the classic
Jul 23 2014,positive,i never liked the original at all and people always have an immediate reaction that a remake must be worse than the original how dare they remake a classic the classic was not good to me even though gene wilder was great in it but johnny depp is a better willy wonka as always depp portrays an eccentric character with mysterious values and knocks it out of the park most of the time he is initially unrecognizable with is boblike chocolate hair and his high pitched voice and pale skin he is a risky actor and he delves deep into the style of his characters in fact pretty much any role he gets this isnt burtons best but he adds his usual touch of dark quirkiness and creativity       the film is much closer to the book than the original so why people dislike this film i have no idea
Jul 21 2014,neutral,510  movie so fucked up its entertaining
Jul 20 2014,positive,i love charlie and the chocolate factory love the first movie and love the book this version is better than old version good movie
Jul 20 2014,positive,depps performance as usual as an actor always please me the factory of chocolate ended sweet and funny
Jul 20 2014,positive,tim burton and his vision in this great adaptation is one of the most joyful films ive ever seen in my life the great cast the wonderful crew tim burton impresses and entertains us again in his new film
Jul 18 2014,positive,people are silly for disliking this film simply because it is not the original in fact its much closer to the source material and one cannot argue how gorgeous it is to look at
Jul 14 2014,positive,truly fascinating but not all that glitters is gold it has gold in it surely butlike in the movie not in every bar
Jul 13 2014,positive,a darkly comical and visually stunning adaptation that does its best to try and make the 1971 adaptation look like childs playand that is where it trips up
Jul 8 2014,negative,tim burton has only made a couple of decent movies in his life and this is not one of them dear god was this just pathetic it was creepy terrible acted and boarder line pycotic the original to me is very good movie and this seems to take a gigantic shit on it tim burton fucks up again and is one of the worst directors of all time 1110
Jul 6 2014,negative,hated it ruined the first movie
Jun 29 2014,positive,this was an interesting take on the classic story i do like the original better do to some of the darker moments
Jun 27 2014,neutral,visually stunning well acted and more faithful to the book but charlie and the chocolate factory suffers from characters that are either too perfect charlie or too unlikeable willy wonka forgettable songs numbers and johnny depps uncomfortably creepy performance
Jun 26 2014,positive,depps wonka is too creepy and he constantly mugs for the camera hes not all that memorable though he does shine in some moments hes also given a bad and unnecessary backstory the design of the world inside the chocolate factory is pretty good and certainly imaginativeits just also a bit scary as well everything feels a bit off and a bit wrong but this is a tim burton film this unnecessary reimagining clocks in at around 2 hours long and is ultimately bloated i do like that this version is somewhat more faithful to the original source material and its certainly still entertaining when its not too busy being creepy and weird although its not a classic and certainly cant hold a candle to the original i say its still worth a peek
Jun 25 2014,negative,willy wonka was the only redeeming value in this movie and even at that even he seemed off key this remake is missing most of the iconic scene of the original films  incorporated some backstory that i really didnt give two shts about
Jun 21 2014,positive,johnny depp rocks as willy wonka
Jun 15 2014,positive,honestly i think this one is better than the 70s one the visuals have improved charlie is likable and in a very strange way i kinda sympathize with willy wonka even though he can be a bit uncomfortable and uncaring sometimes but i just find this one much better
Jun 15 2014,positive,it may not have gene wilders charm or the classic songs that enhanced the original but tim burtons adaptation is still a fun watch
Jun 12 2014,negative,i deeply admire the wonderful production design and even the child actors are an improvement from the original but johnny depp is no gene wilder
Jun 9 2014,negative,dont bother depps awful remake ages 8
Jun 8 2014,positive,very good kids movie all the actors were good
Jun 7 2014,positive,a freaky fantasy that only could be a creation of tim burton and yet remarkably familyfriendly charlie and the chocolate factory is a brilliantly imagined story that fascinates with its simplicity awkwardness splendid performances and unforgettable timburtonian style already a classic it is a movie which is far from being perfect but has managed to please the old fans of the story as well as to earn new ones  the funny and heartwarming adventure of charlie freddie highmore who receives the unique chance to enter the mysterious chocolate factory of willy wonka  johnny depp and compete for the opportunity to become willys right hand in the chocolate manufacturing a wellknown story this adaptation would not have been that remarkable without the influence of tim burton and his unique directing style visually stunning much darker than a normal familyfriendly story and with quite awkward performance of depp as willy wonka burtons version of the book impresses not with its content but with its overall concept   the huge impact of burtons visual and performances concept on the audience has partially negative effect on the audience as the attention is director much more towards his direction of the movie than the story itself the level of awkwardness and eccentricity coming especially from johnny depp might be too much for some but for the fans of tim burton that would be a reason to feel delighted   stylish and bold charlie and the chocolate factory could have been the perfect family movie if it was not for its eccentricity nevertheless it delivers a sweet and funny adventure that could be considered to be one of burton and depps greatest successes
Jun 6 2014,neutral,i like this choclate factory mmm i like the movie
Jun 6 2014,positive,this is my favorite movie of all time as it follows the book perfectly and updates all the characters to modern day
Jun 4 2014,positive,overall this movie works burton and depp make a good movie just as with the original the third act starts to suffer but the first two are a marvel there is enough creepy and surreal moments here to satisfy burtons fans the set design is marvelous as usual
Jun 3 2014,negative,once again tim burton thinks a creepy take on a classic movie is always the solution burton sucks any charm and wonder with this tainted remake complete with a creepy michael jackson like johnny depp
Jun 2 2014,positive,dark full of pretty good special effects and silly fun depp is magnificent in changing into whoever he wants to create a world outside the norm a good story added makes this a decent outing that is better than the original in my opinion
May 31 2014,negative,tim i thought i asked you not to do another crappie d
May 31 2014,positive,solid kid comedy film really stuck true to the book
May 30 2014,positive,comparing this version with the 1971 gene wilder adaptation is definitely not needed while both films had the same purpose its clear that this version is not a remake of the first film but a loyal and less commercialized adaptation of a beloved story to me these two movies are like apples and oranges you really shouldnt compare them because they are very different and both have their own strengths and flawsyes this version of charlie might be a bit too perfect and in my opinion johnny depps performance is a bit too awkward for a character like willy wonka but it succeeds better in giving wonka character having a more consistent tone and of course a style so faithful to the original book that it would have made mr dahl himself proud
May 24 2014,positive,lovely visual and characters it stays true to the book most of the time the oompa loompas will forever disturb me
May 23 2014,positive,i thought that it was a interesting take on the classic
May 17 2014,positive,its a good remake and its very tim burtony
May 11 2014,negative,closer to the book but yeah i prefer the older one its not as overly cheesy as this one johnny depp annoyed the hell out of me also those were not the oompaloompas and the songs were so forgettable at that there were some funny moments though
May 9 2014,positive,while not up to the excellence of its predecessor willy wonka and the chocolate factory charlie and the chocolate factory still provides colorful visuals and bite thanks to a solid performance from johnny depp as willy wonka  after i watched this one i did not understand why so many people have decided to hate it  just because its not as good as the 1971 adaptation it does not mean that it is a bad film  it is closer to its source material has different but charming performances from the cast and gives us a nice modern twist  freddie highmore charms as young charlie  he is characteristically upstanding and gentle and even surpasses charlie from the 1971 version of the film  this factor is not too important in my final evaluation of the film but it provides another reason why charlie and the chocolate factory is a solid movie
May 7 2014,positive,still the most fantastic movie set ive ever seen depp is incredibly quirky eccentric  nicely menacing  amazing throughout love them squirrels
May 5 2014,positive,not as good as the original
May 4 2014,negative,its quite obvious that the 1971 film was better and this movie focuses on visual effects rather than the heart and spirit of the source material
May 4 2014,positive,matches the book more and you can definitely feel tim burtons dark vibe
Apr 30 2014,negative,id have a kid like me im 10 and i read the book and i have watched the movies   you should add a girl turning in to a pumpkin
Apr 29 2014,negative,terrible way worse then the first one
Apr 26 2014,positive,as with many tim burton films the visuals and editing are breathtaking most other things are kinda mediocre
Apr 22 2014,negative,wow how bad does one movie have to be its just ugh how could someone like this crap
Apr 19 2014,positive,its much better than the 1971 version because it is stranger more entertaining and the depiction of the characters are more satisfying johnny depp fit his role perfectly but there are definitely some flaws in the movie for example you never know how certain things happen normally someone would tell you if a piece of their gum turns you blue anyway this movie isnt terrible but its far from great
Apr 18 2014,positive,johnny at his best what an actor and the whole film is like teaching a lesson to many 
Apr 18 2014,positive,although not as good as willy wonka and the chocolate factoryit is still a wonderfully whimsical film
Apr 17 2014,positive,charlie and the chocolate factory was directed by tim burton in 2005 it is very wellknow film because it is drawn of history original of book  it is a comedy film this is a family movie  starring actors and characters are johnny depp he plays a willy wonka freddie highmore who plays charlie bucket he has the leading role and david kelly he plays grandpa joe who he is the supporting character  the film tells a story of a poor little boy who wants visit the chocolate factory and for that he will buy several chocolate tablet in order to find the golden ticket for visit the chocolate factory and become successor of willy wonka but  in first time charlie refuses because he wants stay with his family finally charlie accept the proposition at the condition his family comes live with it  for my the plot seems to be absorbing and riveting the special effects are stunning and staggering the photography is impressive and the performance actors are natural believable and script is contrived  generally i find this film goodthis is a film that view by young public
Apr 15 2014,negative,i love tim burtons films but this was horrible and an insult to a classic kids movie which i grew up on
Apr 14 2014,negative,some movies shouldnt be remade
Apr 13 2014,positive,i thought this movie was hilarious
Apr 13 2014,negative,a shocking misfire by both burton and depp charlie and the chocolate factory certainly can look interesting but its bizarre awkward reimagining of wonka and bland overly perfect take on charlie snuff the whimsy and wonder of the magical original classic
Apr 11 2014,positive,65  its visuals may overshadow the characters but charlie succeeds as a film adaptation thats pretty close to the book
Apr 8 2014,negative,it was kind of nice pintoresque until the damn oompa loompas showed up and ruined everything with dumb forgettable songs i like burton a lot but this is far from his best films
Apr 2 2014,negative,tim burtons version of roald dahls classic work is pretty a copy of the 1971 film starring gene wilder and it just doesnt deliver in fact i found this to be among the worst of tim burtons films in the lead role of willy wonka is johnny depp who is always great in very off the wall eccentric characters but here he is out of place and just doesnt cut i found this be a dull boring film one that tried too hard at putting new life into a classic story the end result is a train wreck of a film one that just doesnt offer anything new or exciting i guess you can say that this is a remake and in that regards its a horrible one and it joining countless other movies that have been butchered by remakes burton has made some great films but charlie and the chocolate factory ranks among his worst with planet of the apes i thought that this film relied more on visuals and effects to try and entertain while the original grabbed your attention with memorable performances well executed storytelling and charm this tries too hard at delivering an entertaining ride by cramming way too much into the film and overdoing everything the finished film just doesnt deliver anything memorable and it ends up being a waste of time dont expect anything good with this film stick with the 1971 film it is a far superior picture and it has a much better cast and it doesnt overdo anything like this one did this one just has nothing to really grab your attention tim burton is talented but he just doesnt pull off anything fun entertaining and ultimately memorable with his version of charlie and the chocolate factory
Mar 31 2014,positive,yes the remake was not the best one ever but it still was magical funny and portrayed the great chocolate maker in a different light
Mar 24 2014,positive,badly underrated if you ask me some of the cgi is a little questionable but for the most part the visuals are a delight and the script strong the oompaloompa songs are very enjoyable and catchy and this is a worthwhile update why johnny depp chose to channel michael jackson for his role is a bit beyond me but the net result is a success
Mar 22 2014,positive,good movie seen it on itunes sd cost 749
Mar 17 2014,positive,i love this movie so much
Mar 11 2014,positive,it was ok but not burtons best
Mar 10 2014,positive,i really love what burton did with the willy wonka remake he took what we knew about the original and made it his own and lets not forget johnny depps performace in this movie which was excellent
Mar 9 2014,positive,not as good as the old one
Mar 7 2014,positive,in its quirky and fun ways chocolate factory succeeds especially with depp as its leading man playing his usual kooky but fun character depp amazes you as willy wonka
Mar 7 2014,negative,first one is way better
Mar 6 2014,positive,if it wasnt for the cleverness and the dark approach this adaptation of roald dahls book will melt
Mar 4 2014,positive,the johnny depp version if this film is simply a very modern remake to the original willy wonka and the chocolate factory with gene wilder
Mar 3 2014,positive,5 golden tickets to visit wonkas chocolate factory       the second adaptation of the famous book by roald dahl and remake to the film willy wonka  the chocolate factory starring gene wilder is this 2005 version charlie and the chocolate factory by tim burton edward scissorhands corpse bride this colorful and slightly more sinister version brings one of the best children stories ever written filled with candy and moral lessons i like the fact we get to know more about willy wonkas past where the oompaloompas come from and what happens to charlie and his family after the visit starring burtons personal favorites johnny depp edward scissorhands from hell helena boham carter fight club les misérables and christopher lee lord of the rings trilogy and introducing freddie highmore as charlie a remake worthy of a golden ticket     after industrial espionage willy wonkas johnny depp chocolate factory had fired all his employers and closed the doors now candy is still made in all secrecy five children can have the opportunity to visit the factory guided by an adult relative they only need to find a golden ticket that has been enclosed in the popular chocolate bars the first ticket is found by the gluttonous augustus gloop from düsseldorf the second by the spoiled veruca salt from london the third by the competitive violet beauregarde from atlanta and the forth by arrogant gamer mike teavee from denver the last ticket is found by charlie buckethighmore a poor boy who lives with his parents and grandparents in a small shack just across the chocolate factory when the day of the visit breaks the ten guests find themselves in a colorful world of candy and learn that not everything is as harmless as it seems
Mar 2 2014,neutral,what a creepy remake its good but the back story of willy wonka is very throwaway give me the all singing all dancing original any day
Feb 26 2014,positive,as good as the 1971 rendition but juiced up on steroids an eyepopping adventure
Feb 24 2014,negative,once again tim burton remakes an untouchable classic by deciding that the movie is good but needs more johnny depp this only sought to cement the original as a timeless classic
Feb 19 2014,positive,its a family friendly movie and very weird funny and full of action
Feb 16 2014,positive,its fine but there was no reason to remake what was already brilliant
Feb 14 2014,positive,a dark comedy for kids 8110
Feb 14 2014,positive,an ok remake thats more closer to the novel but still delivers thanks to johnny depps crazy performance as willy wonka
Feb 11 2014,negative,i really dont like this movie
Feb 6 2014,positive,while a lot of fun and sticking closer to the book its just not near as fun due to its lack of great performances and pathetic musical numbers try the original first then the remake and youll see what i mean
Feb 2 2014,positive,there are very few films that are so recognised that they cannot be remade this remake is full of flaws and doesnt even hit the standards of the orignal classic the visuals on certain characters is unbelieveably poorits completely obvious the songs are not very clever and are no way near as iconic as the original
Jan 30 2014,positive,you will sit there in utter shock at how fucking bad this is youll be stunned that this is indeed an actual movie not just a figment of your imagination and you may wonder how this got made and who saw it and said yeah this is a good idea youll also wonder how a good director like tim burton agreed to direct this after reading the script and said to himself yeah i like this im going to make this alas this is my guilty pleasure but im not happy to admit that
Jan 24 2014,positive,not sure what critics saw the original was clever and really great but this was too creepy and weird
Jan 17 2014,positive,i got that one it is good
Jan 14 2014,negative,so bad i wanted to claw my eyes out
Jan 5 2014,positive,the inventive visuals make up for its flaws
Jan 5 2014,positive,its a great movie and stay true to the source material of the book
Jan 4 2014,positive,personally i liked willy wonka and the chocolate factory better but this adaptation is still decent now johnny depp plays willi wonka here and unfortunately he doesnt fit there quite well
Dec 29 2013,negative,what the flying heck was that this is one of the worst junkheaps ive ever seen the characters were bland the acting was terrible the editing was screwed and it was just hard to get invested to the film in the first place
Dec 25 2013,neutral,way to ruin an original idea by a film 
Dec 21 2013,negative,why was this film made no idea  johnny depp is no gene wilder
Dec 18 2013,neutral,it is a good adaptation of the book with fine visuals but no real character development
Dec 18 2013,positive,tim burtons quirky sensibilities and johnny depps oddball acting style lend extremely well to the film which feels like a much more accomplished and respectful adaptation of roald dahls classic tale
Dec 13 2013,positive,tim burton i love you only you could spin a childrens film into a creepy dark genre and pull it off
Dec 11 2013,negative,for what it was worth i will give the film credit for trying to make a film closer to the classic novel but that does not excuse the fact that this film was completely unnecessary
Dec 9 2013,negative,no where near as good as the original  more faithful to the source does not mean better
Dec 7 2013,negative,its a good little film to watch but johnny depp isnt as good as gene wilder its just way too creepy and it just doesnt do justice to the book stick to the original for the real experience
Dec 7 2013,neutral,highly flawed rendition of the timeless story fails to recapture the original 70s masterpiece and is filled with many major issues but the sets look nice and the musical numbers are strong
Dec 4 2013,negative,original way better
Dec 1 2013,negative,what a slap in the face to gene wilder
Nov 30 2013,positive,at moments this movie is enjoyable but the rest of it is very dull
Nov 26 2013,positive,though it can be fun at times tim burtons new look at the classic character of willy wonka is similar to a whatchamacallit bar you really dont know what you should call it
Nov 25 2013,positive,incredibly incredible
Nov 22 2013,positive,i love this movie i will watch it over and over again
Nov 20 2013,positive,aggressively bizarre but visually stylish tim burtons charlie and the chocolate factory is not for everyone but tim burton and johnny depp show their skill in their respective capacities
Nov 11 2013,positive,a remake that has tons of swag
Nov 9 2013,neutral,this movie that is a okay movie the performances are okey the directing by tim burton is good score and specail effects is excellent
Nov 3 2013,positive, decent but just not quite as magic as the originalwould of got another half a star for some decent oompa loompa songs
Oct 30 2013,positive,super good and really funny this movie is awesome a 92 by aidan
Oct 27 2013,positive,johnny depp at his finest
Oct 24 2013,negative,even though this is a more faithful adaptation 1971 feels more like roald dahl and is just a superior film
Oct 22 2013,negative,tim burton spins rohl dahls tale into nothing we wanted to see
Oct 22 2013,positive,although it cant even try to be at the level of gene wilders philosophical and timeless classic burton has made a very entertaining and fun film if you watch this movie without comparing it to the original version youre bound to have a good time
Oct 21 2013,negative,not as good as willie wonka and the chocolate factory
Oct 20 2013,positive,one of my favorite movies of all time
Oct 19 2013,positive,dont understand all the hate for this one either it has some great visuals odd characters and a nice exploration into the background of willy wonka
Oct 16 2013,negative,not a very good remake
Oct 13 2013,positive,this is a good movie its not the movies fault that its stained by johnny depps ridiculous performance
Oct 5 2013,positive,honestly i liked it better than the original the story wasnt meant to be told as a musical except for the oompa loompas which was re created perfectly here
Oct 5 2013,positive,id definitely want to visit the chocolate factory if it was real
Oct 4 2013,positive,awesome a really cool movie the chocolate looks deliciousi give it a 90
Sep 29 2013,positive,though johnny depps performance is problematic charlie succeeds thanks to great special effects and memorable songs from composer danny elfman
Sep 22 2013,negative,johnny depp only reason i saw it
Sep 20 2013,positive,10  acting  75  writing  7  dialogue  75  plot  characterization  8  cinematography  editing  8  soundtrackscore  set design  85  how much i enjoyed it personally  75
Sep 16 2013,positive,so much better than the original
Sep 9 2013,positive,good way better than the original one 89
Sep 8 2013,positive,with a darker tone better visuals and a great deal of witty humor i consider this an improvement upon the 1971 version
Sep 8 2013,positive,this movie catches a lot of flak for those who prefer the 1971 version however i really prefer this version and so does the dahl estate the book authors family who had control over this production after being unhappy with the original  by no means am i saying i didnt like the other version this one is just better and i dont consider it to be a true remake  although it can trail a little off course here and there in order to give willy a backstory it overall has better story and characters deep roy as an oompa loompa is just freaking awesome  my daughter hasnt seen the 1971 version but loves this one so it probably will happen over time where the nostalgia will wear off although both will remain classics
Sep 4 2013,negative,the beginning was ok but when depp showed up on screen this movie annoyed me to death
Sep 3 2013,negative,my problem here is simple this is not my kind of movie  johnny depp give a wonderfully weird performance  fun enough to watch but i just could not get into it  i prefer the original and it still is not my  kind of film
Sep 1 2013,positive,johnny depp is one of my favorite hilariously funny in any movie
Aug 30 2013,positive,good to watch with the kids
Aug 28 2013,positive,type of character depp always does well
Aug 27 2013,positive,tim burtons reimagined concoction of roald dahls classic is darker yet visually appealing and provides both familyfriendly and cautionary tale for kids however the only ingredient which induced the tooth decay was johnny depps outlandish and freaky dressup as willy wonka
Aug 27 2013,negative,it has burtons signature touch but its a meanspirited rehash of the original that has depps weirdest performance yet
Aug 25 2013,negative,tim burtons charlie and the chocolate factory is proof that closer to the book does not always mean better movie the films overblown distractingly odd style is only overpowered by johnny depps bizarre and unfitting michael jackson impersonation
Aug 23 2013,positive,it was a great family adventure it had great cinematography great cast very exciting adventure very excellent special effects very well done costumes really great makeup great characters great music and a great storyline its one of the best family movies of 2005 i think johnny depp did a great job by playing willy wonka i definitely recommend this movie to both kids and adults
Aug 20 2013,positive,goodbut i was expecting a lot more from the first onei agree not the best movie remake but i got a few giggles out of it
Aug 16 2013,positive,willy wonka was certainly a role that johnny depp was meant to play on some levels i believe it is just as good if not better than its 1971 predecessor charlie and the chocolate factory is quirky clever and entertaining for pretty much all age groups
Aug 15 2013,positive,liked this movie could be a bit funny good for the family though 
Aug 10 2013,positive,not even close as good as willy wonka
Aug 8 2013,positive,charlie and the chocolate factory may lack the heart of the 1971 original but it is closer to the book and adds more to the story in a darker but satisfying way it is visually fantastic and is able to keep the morals of the story
Aug 7 2013,positive,great movie i absolutely love it
Aug 7 2013,positive,this adaptation of roald dahls book fell short of my expectations  the whimsy i hoped to catch was a bit too cynical
Aug 4 2013,positive,better than the origional
Aug 3 2013,positive,as it doesnt have quite the charm as the original this remake can be a fun movie
Jul 27 2013,positive,i love the movie but i love epic to
Jul 27 2013,neutral,you hardly ever see a movie get too much and not enough criticism i guess this would make this a rare movie
Jul 24 2013,positive,my impression on this movie has been ambiguous since the first time i watched it i absolutely love the scenes set outside the factory especially the first 30 minutes or so which were focused on charlies family and the golden tickets that were being found around the world those scenes were beautiful and exciting once they went to the factory and johnny depps willy wonka appears the movie changed completely and all the factory scenes were not very appealing to me and one of the reasons is probably the fact that they were too colorful for my eyes and another reason might be the fact that i hated those damn oompa loompas    the storys conclusion was excellently done and i really liked it but the movie as a whole did not fulfill all my expectations in general i must say it was another solid work by tim burton but it lacked a bit of the magic his films usually have by the way i enjoyed very much christopher lees small role as wonkas father
Jul 24 2013,negative,an atrocity beyond imagination is what awaits anyone who watches charlie and the chocolate factory  in the hands of tim burton this beloved childrens tale becomes a demented psychopathic maze of sh  the one highlight of the film is danny elfmans music but it doesnt compare to the classic songs of the original  charlie and the chocolate factory is a soulless family comedy thats bereft of joy and wonder
Jul 24 2013,positive,i still have an immense amount of respect for tim burton but this adaption cant even compare to the gene wilder original this is a fun movie that im obviously not the target audience for i will say though that the visuals are incredible and the performance by johnny depp was fantastic
Jul 24 2013,negative,i love tim burton hes a great director for the most part with clever ideas and a unique style that can definitely work  i also love johnny depp for his charismatic acting and his unique style as well which goes so well with burton  but the classic 1971 willy wonka and the chocolate factory is a great film without a doubt  when i heard that they were remaking it i had no problems with itbut that was before i saw this piece of shit movie    firstlyit was around the time of this movie when i realized that depp was getting old in his acting  it seems like he created an eccentric and creepy character in fear  loathing and developed it further in the potc franchise falling in love with that performance so much that he hardly used any other  and thats a shame because hes done so many various roles before still the sparrow character is used here and it just doesnt work  its like jack sparrow walked into the set and wouldnt leave so burton just decided to make the movie about him  secondthat kid who plays charlie is bland as shit hes not compelling not emotional like the 71 charlie was and he does not work the way a normal kid of that age would which is what the original charlie was supposed to be minus of course that hes poor  this highmore kid tries to be a kid jesus and that doesnt work now the scenery in the movie is alright and to be honest kinda intelligent but it stops being about charlie and becomes what the book and original movie werent about willy wonka himself  doesnt it seem odd that the original entitled by wonkas name as both advertisement and because charlie was a stereotypical term for the viet cong at the time was actually about the main character and the film named for charlie was about the man who was meant to be a mystery it just seems like both burton and depp didnt understand the book or the original movie at all  thankfully it wouldnt be long 2 years before depp would actually play a character unlike sparrow in sweeney todd then go right back to sparrow and seems to still use this wornout cloak of a style to this day
Jul 20 2013,positive,it was another tim burton version of the movie
Jul 19 2013,positive,this version is just as good as the classic there were some differences and similarities but i looked beyond them what made the johnny depp version more enjoyable is the music of renowned composer danny elfman johnny depp really surprised me with his take on willy wonka and the kids including freddie highmore and annasophia robb were a great support as well its hard to decide which version of author roald dahls classic book adaptation is better if i had to choose between the two i think theyre both equally terrific
Jul 18 2013,positive,a wondrous adaptation of roald dahls imaginative childrens book burton reinvents the original movies dullness into a darker glossier and more thrilling film but spares too much in the way of entertainment indulging more for children than adults
Jul 18 2013,positive,this is hilarious man i like this one so much better than the first  compelling review from the docto
Jul 17 2013,positive,a kind of creepy dark twist to the original willy wonka and the chocolate factory but what else would you expect from the great tim burton i enjoyed the film and the quirkiness of johnny depp as wonka
Jul 13 2013,negative,its good then johnny depp comes in and is the gayest of any gay thing ever but it is visually striking as are all burton films
Jul 12 2013,positive,it was interesting ill give you that
Jul 11 2013,neutral,wouldve been a worthy remake if they hadnt butchered the musical numbers 
Jul 10 2013,negative,far worse than the movie it attempts to remake
Jul 10 2013,positive,to adapt roald dahls beloved story is a difficult task and i am very pleased   that tim burtons adaption was nothing short of excellent the characters are   well portraid and the setting has that tim burton charm to it but still holds true   to the source material the acting is solid and the special effects are near   perfect i also have to give a big applause to the people behind the script and   screenplay now there is one big shortcoming in this movie that holds it back   from being one of the greatest remakes in recent memory and that is the   ompalompas the lack the charm and singing ability sometimes they are even   a bit creepy every time the ompalompas begin to sing its truly a pain to sit   through overall an excellent movie but it could be even better if not for the   ompalompas
Jul 8 2013,positive,tim barton is the man when he and johnny dep do something together its always a super big awesome movie
Jul 7 2013,positive,i liked it as a kid but frankly its too much charlie is uninteresting wonka is exaggeratedly goofy and thus unsympathetic and the whole universe is too damn dark and bombastic remember those singing dollrobots that sing that unbearable willy wonka song in the beginning the image of them melting was imprinted in my impressionable mind and still haunts me but its still very funny and visually excellent its tim burton duhr herpderp and so i consider it an okay aboveaverage childrens movie very creativebut a little too creative
Jul 4 2013,negative,as disrespectful remakes go this takes the cake
Jul 4 2013,negative,an abomination in every way except visually
Jul 1 2013,positive,very interesting not as good as the original i enjoyed this film  like the unique  thoughtful scenery  clever writing
Jul 1 2013,positive,not so good for many reasons such like the movie focusing more on wonka than charlie then why was it called charlie and the chocolate factory and the weirdness of depp being a bit too hard to take on here but the visuals and the songs are enough to keep us in our seats entertained
Jun 30 2013,positive,johnny depp is the best
Jun 30 2013,positive,a good movie and an interesting take on the original both the old movie and the novel but by this point in time seeing johnny depp playing a weird character is an aging concept
Jun 24 2013,negative,original is always better especially here
Jun 23 2013,neutral,not magical but rather bizarre and annoying an assault on the senses roald dahls book was great but this sucked probably one of my least favorite tim burton movies
Jun 22 2013,negative,worst than the original thanks a lot tim burton
Jun 21 2013,neutral,a massacre compared to the original
Jun 19 2013,neutral,overly childish this movie is not for everyone
Jun 14 2013,neutral,the original with gene wilder was better
Jun 12 2013,positive,love tim burton and johnny depp they make great movies
Jun 12 2013,positive,not the original but still okay
Jun 11 2013,positive,great movie even for adults
Jun 11 2013,positive,a little bit weirder than the first depp goes a good job a wonka
Jun 11 2013,neutral,tim burtons weird adaption of roald dahls novel is a partly hilarious movie that stars a fantastic johnny depp as the maverick chocolatier and freddie highmore as the eponymous boy who is allowed to pay a visit to the formers mysterious chocolate factory while the funny yet not at all musically complex musical numbers are a welcome and amusing gimmick and depp provides allagesentertainment at its best very little of this movie stays in memory the production design and the costumes are impressive but its the 21st century and a creative director like mr burton couldve really made more out of the source material furthermore most of the movies cast is miserable and extremely overacts their parts the bad performances are also bred by the utterly silly screenplay that may contain good laughs for preschool kids however is oftentimes boring and really cheaply written i cant help myself but think that mr burton didnt even utilize half of the potential that the original story has but besides that its a very enjoyable family movie that has truly humorous scenes for both kids and adults
Jun 9 2013,positive,i love this show movie
Jun 8 2013,positive,willie wonka kinda scares me in this one
Jun 7 2013,positive,still prefer the original
Jun 6 2013,negative,i think you need a ton of drugs for this one  i never saw the originally until recently but this was downright awful
Jun 5 2013,negative,willy wonka much better
Jun 5 2013,negative,although johnny depp was great i have to say it wasnt as good as the original
Jun 4 2013,positive,thought it was going to suck as bad as tim burtons remake of planet of the apes but actually liked it more than the original
Jun 4 2013,negative,not as good as the original
Jun 3 2013,positive,i have to say that i actually enjoyed this film i enjoyed the fact that tim burton decided to have it be closer to the source material but also because the film moved at a good pace the 1971 version with gene wilder is great but i found that this film was slightly better the film is also typical tim burton its crazy very gothic and also strongly dark the casting is perfect especially with johnny depp as willy wonka who i feel did a good job freddie highmore is also perfectly cast as charlie buckett as are the four other child actors who depict the other kids brought to the chocolate factory the cinematography is also very beautiful while danny elfmans score is jazzy and perfectly moves the film along the film is definitely a different feel but is still wonderful to watch
Jun 2 2013,negative,orignal why do remakes
Jun 2 2013,negative,original is a bit boring
Jun 1 2013,positive,it felt closer to the original book minus the daddy issues
Jun 1 2013,negative,as much as i love tim burton and love johnny depp i have to say that gene wilder was a much better willy wonka johnny depp just made him seem as some high strung damaged man that was stuck in a world of dreams and sugar the original movie was just so much more tasteful
May 30 2013,positive,its also one of my faveret moves to watch
May 30 2013,positive,the first one is better
May 29 2013,positive,tim burton did well this movie is much better than burtons planet of the apes and alice in wonderland
May 27 2013,negative,cant compare to the original
May 27 2013,positive,roald dahl is weird
May 26 2013,positive,i still like the original

May 25 2013,negative,not intrested it looked kl but u no
May 24 2013,positive,creepy movie and i dont know why people fall head over heels for johnny depp
May 24 2013,positive,not ur same ol charlie factory
May 23 2013,positive,a somewhat creepy film charlie and the chocolate factory is led by johnny depps best acting job to date and five amazing performances from the children this version of roald dahls acclaimed novel stays truer to its source material focusing more on back story and less on singing
May 23 2013,positive,oh johnny why must you be so creepy in this movie
May 22 2013,positive,slightly better than the original in my opinion with the same warm moral feelings and somewhat superior acting due to its budget and slicker appearance
May 22 2013,positive,for once an original attempt at a remake
May 21 2013,negative,willy wonka is creepy
May 21 2013,positive,way better than origional

May 20 2013,negative,i liked the original better
May 19 2013,positive,very good version but why in the world did they use the glass elevator the way they did at the end very accurate adaptation until the very end where they decide just to go and be wierd jhnny depp is excellent though
May 19 2013,positive,while not necessarily a bad movie and closer to the original book dahls original intentions are skewed by the exploration of darker themes the eerie design of the chocolate factory and depps positively unnerving portrayal of willy wonka
May 19 2013,negative,i felt this film was just to dark
May 18 2013,positive,iloved the original but johnny depp really captured willy wonka
May 18 2013,positive,the first version had quaint charm this version has jokes about cannibalism you be the judge
May 18 2013,positive,kinda wierd but liked the way they ploted it out
May 18 2013,positive,good filmjohnny depp n0t as hot but oh well
May 16 2013,negative,has its good moments
May 16 2013,neutral,good or terrible i just dont know
May 16 2013,positive,a young boy freddie highmore wins a tour through the most magnificent chocolate factory in the world led by the worlds most unusual candy maker johnny depp    also stars helena bonham carter noah taylor david kelly missi pyle james fox deep roy and christopher lee    directed by tim burton
May 15 2013,positive,either you like it or you dont i didnt hate it but it was an unneccessary film
May 15 2013,positive,it turns out that charlie and the chocolate factory is half goofygreat and half just a goof burton is as always a brilliant creator of atmosphere when you see the listing hovel inhabited by the bucket family you can almost hear the groan of the collapsing ceiling and feel the greasy slickness of the bedsâtm dirty sheets when charlie unwraps a wonka chocolate bar burton makes the outer paper wrapper crackle and its tinfoil lining crinkle palpably when anyone bites into the sweet food you can feel the collapse of the dusky cocoa confection between your own teeth and while you and the kiddies surrender to this candyland board game come to life youâtmll also chuckle at the zippy little homages to everything from busby berkeley musicals to psycho
May 15 2013,positive,not johnnys best but its watchable i guess
May 14 2013,positive,better than the 1971 version film director tim burton makes it look realistic
May 13 2013,positive,not as good as original
May 13 2013,positive,lol a pretty decent remake should watch it at least once 
May 13 2013,neutral,not one of johnny depps best performances i felt it was over played and too much  computer generation was used
May 12 2013,negative,this movie did not feel necessary or comfortable and all i could think about while viewing this was how much better the 1971 gene wilder version was
May 12 2013,positive,the old was cuz wanker was clewa da new 1 is badass cuz
May 12 2013,positive,doesnt match up to the willy wonka and the chocolate factory but its still a good movie
May 11 2013,negative,original was way better
May 11 2013,positive,good interpretation of the book
May 9 2013,negative,johnny depp gives a very creepy performance as willy wonka i much prefer gene wilder in the role
May 9 2013,negative,bad to the point where its almost unwatchable
May 8 2013,positive,nice twist on the original which was the first movie i ever saw in a theater  teaches you about the 7 deadly sins
May 8 2013,positive,johnny depp is class in it
May 7 2013,positive,not as good as willy wonka and the chocolate factory but its got its own twists and turns that make it another film entirely
May 6 2013,positive,awesome johnny depp kicks major oompa loompa butt
May 6 2013,negative,not one of my favorite johnny depp movies
May 5 2013,neutral,not as good as original orlando bloom acts like he should be in a pyciatric ward
May 5 2013,positive,loved the original film as a child the new version i was sceptical about until i saw willy wonka johnny depp is one of my fav actors and he really made this role his own would recommend this to everyone good family film with some nostalgia for the parents remembering the original top depp performance as always 
May 5 2013,positive,this is such a good film kids love it
May 5 2013,negative,so gay compared to the original
May 5 2013,positive,72  you could either consider this film as extremely irritating and obnoxious or as a stupid funny film that does not take itself seriously i prefer the second thing though it is not bad to follow the other idea  willy wonka is the craziest and the most ludicrous of all the funny characters that depp had done before it even surpasses his role in pirates of the car series but this is from the team of the famous depp burton duo i liked almost every single film they made though i dont wish to see dark shadows2012               helena bonham carter is also there in a role as in almost all burton  films the main problem with this film is that the character of charlie is underdeveloped and both the film and the novel try to prove his worthiness by showing the unworthiness of the other 4 charlie value is only shown when he stays behind for his family which is actually a cliched plot element this film is passable other ways the  oompa loompas are often irritating but their songs are really funny
May 4 2013,positive,not too much like the original but it was ok
May 4 2013,positive,oompa loompa doppity doo  ive got a great suggestion for you  this is a pretty entertaining flick  on your next chance make sure it gets picked
May 3 2013,positive,not bad for the most part but i prefer the original
May 3 2013,negative,expected more from the lovely tim
May 3 2013,negative,the first one is way better
May 3 2013,positive,johnny depp is so freaky in this but is funny at the same time
May 3 2013,positive,depp and chocolate heaven
May 2 2013,positive,a bit more grownup and enjoyable than the willy wonka version
May 2 2013,positive,i was surprised how funny this movie was i thought it was just a kids movie
May 2 2013,positive,i love chocolate and this move was good
May 2 2013,positive,it seems that even with pretty horrible kids johnny depp is a great star if they act in the same movie the fact is if he was in the latest king kong movie he would have made king kong look a bit low on i q and people would not have imagined that great emotion gives great power and king kong was not responsible with any power the fact that natural kids cannot make depp sober makes him a non pareil actor and i hope i have the meaning right the horrible little girl has also acted in a horror movie and should have been wonka williams in the movie instead of depp being willie wonka it seems unusual that mr quentin tarantino isnt the director but very usual that tim burton is being the first batman the movie is along the inglorious basterds line the children are gold guineas rodents who buy the chocolatiers factory finished goods and are also test creatures hence they are weighted in imaginary gold because the gold standard doesnt exist
May 1 2013,negative,a boring film to watch but visually its good
May 1 2013,positive,good but the original is better
May 1 2013,positive,i still liked the gene wilder version better
Apr 28 2013,positive,still love this even though im older
Apr 28 2013,positive,hannahs all time favorite
Apr 27 2013,negative,depp is great but everything else is just all around awful  this version is garbage  charlie is just so damn nice i truly wish i could have punched him in the face and tell him to be force full damn it  the other characters fail in comparison to the original and so does the film  no where close to the 71 film and doesnt add anything new creative original or interesting  this film just sucked and failed miserably
Apr 26 2013,positive,i have seen this and it is a good movie
Apr 25 2013,negative,boring and a big let down
Apr 25 2013,positive,excellent fx original was better movie

Apr 24 2013,positive,it was a very his movie
Apr 24 2013,positive,good but too much tim burton for my liking
Apr 22 2013,positive,creepy johnny depp and a classic raold dahl story even though roald dahl never wanted his films to be made into movies this is a testament that he might not have been to sad about it
Apr 22 2013,negative,this version made you feel sorry for wonka which is hard to do in itself  the original had charm and a heartwarming ending with a moral and a feeling of justice  this version completely missed the point
Apr 19 2013,positive,this probably isnt a fivestar film but im giving it five for the pure entertainment quality visual marvel and dark quirky humor are two of my favorite secondary qualities in movies this combines the two and does it in brilliant fashion tim burton is often hit or miss but this is definitely one of his hits
Apr 18 2013,negative,if youre looking for the same whimsy and childhood awe that the original film inspired then this remake will fall well short burtons odd rendition of this hollywood classic seems far from what author dahl would have wanted
Apr 18 2013,positive,again with the johnny thing 
Apr 18 2013,positive,tim burtons directing proves to be whimsical and quirky enough to respectably stand out amongst its predecessor
Apr 17 2013,positive,a good twist on a great classic
Apr 17 2013,neutral,nothin beats the first version but jonny depp makes a good willy wonka
Apr 16 2013,positive,ok love the umper lumpers

Apr 11 2013,positive,ruined and reinvented all in one
Apr 11 2013,positive,not bad at all almost as good as the original and johnny depp is excellent once again
Apr 10 2013,negative,its visually great and slightly closer to the book than the original film but its also too dark for a story of its type and has a painfully annoying performance by johnny depp
Apr 10 2013,positive,again i like johnny depp he he
Apr 10 2013,positive,nothing special just average good acting meh movie
Apr 9 2013,positive,johnny depp did freak me out a bit but i love this movie lol
Apr 9 2013,negative,not a patch on the original
Apr 9 2013,positive,average original ws better
Apr 9 2013,neutral,old one was more fun better fantasy for kids
Apr 8 2013,positive,let down by that god awful umpa lumpa and the rubbish up to date songs mr depp saved this alot
Apr 7 2013,positive,this is my favorite movie of all time besides the swan princess and willy wonka and the chocolate factory so it is third
Apr 7 2013,negative,i know im in the minority here but i wasnt jumping up and down about this movie i loved the original film with gene wilder for its own original contributionsperhaps im biased still i have always admired tim burton and johnny depps work and had been looking forward to this new interpretation of roald dahls book    this film was indeed more true to the book than the 1971 versionthe squirrel room the jungle scene the children leaving the factory perhaps a little wiser for the wear however the character development of the 1971 version was much better than hereyou were actually given an opportunity to like or dislike each character including willy wonka i did think that johnny depps portrayal of wonka was more true to the book than gene wilderswilly wonka is supposed to be quite childish and eccentric however i thought that this films preoccupation with being true to the book caused it to overlook what is more important which is to establish the intentions of each character     its true that the oompa loompas are physically portrayed accurately here more so than in the 1971 version however though the songs they sing here are true to the book they are less charismatic than those of the 1971 film and sometimes seem over the top    finally i was appalled with the ending it changed the whole idea behind the story itself which is supposed to be that people can overcome their hardships to have a happy and prosperous ending as long as theyre honest selfless and generous this movie changes the whole theme of the story to one that emphasizes the importance of family over any kind of material wealth or prosperity both are perfectly good and legitimate themes but my reading of the book left me with an impression that roald dahl was more concerned with the former theme than the latter
Apr 6 2013,positive,more accurate to the book then that stupid musical made in the 70s
Apr 5 2013,positive,a good childrens movie
Apr 5 2013,positive,featuring a typically excellent performance from depp and burtons signature style this new adaptation is dark well acted faithful and generally good fun mostly due to the vibrant heart of the original source material
Apr 5 2013,negative,creeeeepy johnny dep as michael jackson
Apr 4 2013,positive,burton creates a surreal environment and depp is fantastic

Apr 2 2013,negative,only the original with gene wilder
Apr 1 2013,positive,i wanted to like this more i like depp and lee but the shoes are just too big to fill by itself the movie is ok but it pales in comparison to the original wilders wonka is just too disturbing even if hes more subtle
Apr 1 2013,positive,watched it over and over   classic

Mar 27 2013,negative,takes far too many liberties with the original story no mention of his brothers and we dont get to see him recording thriller
Mar 27 2013,positive,not as bad as you might think should have burtoned it up more though
Mar 27 2013,negative,gene wilder is willy wonka  not jonny depp  plus those new oompa loompa songs were terrible

Mar 23 2013,positive,it is good you have to see it
Mar 23 2013,positive,while it is a bit overlong it really brings a lot of great layers to some characters  interesting concepts that the original film didnt have and overall just feels like a very focused vision of the classic story also depp is fantastic  burtons direction is phenomenal one of burtons very best
Mar 22 2013,positive,the direction was a campy refreshing revision of the franchise
Mar 22 2013,negative,good effort but not so good
Mar 22 2013,neutral,70s gene wilder version is superior

Mar 21 2013,positive,creeoy but chloe loves it
Mar 21 2013,negative,horrible and creepy  willy wonka is not a child molester mr depp
Mar 21 2013,positive,tim burton adapting a roald dahl book it is like a dream came true it met my every expectation it was dark emotional and the visuals are great it also features wonderful performances by freddie highmore and johnny depp

Mar 18 2013,positive,the kids will love this
Mar 17 2013,positive,more true to the source material then the 1971 version tim burton gives a modern retelling of roald dahls classic johnny depp is just a bonus
Mar 17 2013,positive,oh man johnny depp amazes me with every movie he does he is an all around amazing actor
Mar 16 2013,positive,cycles between being unique and unnecessary charlie and the chocolate factory is flawed but potentially entertaining for those wanting a quirky showcase  for johnny depps talent
Mar 15 2013,positive,the old one not the new one
Mar 13 2013,positive,great addition to the classic willy wonka not often that i enjoy a remake just as much as original

Mar 11 2013,positive,love this movie very entertaining
Mar 11 2013,positive,incredibly stunning visuals and great story performances are flawless one of tim burtons best
Mar 10 2013,negative,johnny depp as willy wonka is really a disservice to the entire story but the real problem here is that it didnt need to be redone some day tim burton should just make a movie called johnny depp plot twist johnny depp is played by helena bonham carter
Mar 10 2013,positive,one of my fave films
Mar 8 2013,positive,great movie for adults as well as kids
Mar 8 2013,positive,this was crazy lol even my dad was watching it

Mar 6 2013,positive,its certainly not a horrible film however it does not compare to the classic 1971 film willy wonka and the chocolate factory the film certainly stays true to the darker atmosphere of the writings of roald dahl however the 1971 version remains a childhood classic for most people

Feb 27 2013,positive,really enjoyed this one too
Feb 27 2013,positive,burtons film is good but doe snot outdo the origonal
Feb 27 2013,positive,to adapt roald dahls beloved story is a difficult task and i am very pleased that tim burtons adaption was nothing short of excellent the characters are well portraid and the setting has that tim burton charm to it but still holds true to the source material the acting is solid and the special effects are near perfect i also have to give a big applause  to the people behind the script and screenplay now there is one big shortcoming in this movie that holds it back from being one of the greatest remakes in recent memory and that is the ompalompas the lack the charm and singing ability sometimes they are even a bit creepy every time the ompalompas begin to sing its truly a pain to sit through overall an excellent movie but it could be even better if not for the ompalompas
Feb 26 2013,negative,no johnny deppyou cant beat the original
Feb 26 2013,positive,not as good as the old one but good
Feb 25 2013,negative,can i give this zero stars horrible waste of two hours of your life the original is one of the best movies ever watch that instead tim burton really shines when he creates movies from his own ideas batman being the trend bucker

Feb 24 2013,negative,overated but at least not as bad as the original
Feb 23 2013,negative,michael jackson was scary johnny depp in this movie was equally as freaky
Feb 23 2013,positive,i really loved the original 70s version with gene wilder one of my all time favorite fantasy movies along with the wizard of oz  but depp did a twist on the character and might resemble the original character from the book by roald dahl
Feb 22 2013,positive,much better than the 1st johnny depp works his magic once again
Feb 21 2013,positive,good movie great for kids
Feb 21 2013,positive,doesnt do the original movie justice but it does the book justice hence why i only put three stars if it had the stuff just shorter then i would put five
Feb 21 2013,neutral,no where near as good as the original
Feb 21 2013,negative,jonny depp is crap in this film only good bit was the umpa lumpas
Feb 21 2013,positive,not as gd as the first

Feb 17 2013,negative,i love johhny but he was a freak in this one
Feb 16 2013,positive,the classic written by roald dahl is well visualized in tim burtons film more than it is in 1971s willy wonka  the chocolate factory the audience are introduced to the amazing world of chocolate where the fantasy never ends all people from all ages will enjoy this one
Feb 15 2013,negative,not as good as the originial
Feb 15 2013,positive,a fairly faithful adaptation but since when does willy wonka have daddy issues

Feb 12 2013,positive,not as good as the original
Feb 12 2013,positive,umm kinda weird but nostalgic and neat
Feb 11 2013,neutral,charlie and the chocolate factory starts out as an extremely surprising and enjoyable improvement from the beloved classic however as soon as the talented johnny depp enters the screen and we step into the fantastical world of the chocolate factory the movie takes a turn for the worse this is mainly due to depps extremely bizarre portrayal of willy wonka that comes off as a little too  rapey
Feb 11 2013,positive,i love it and own it
Feb 10 2013,negative,i like some of the added parts to the story but you just cant beat a classic
Feb 10 2013,negative,somewhere between this and the  wilder adaptation lies the perfect balance tim burton induces seizures with this mildly amusing childrens tale

Feb 3 2013,positive,roald dahls classic tale about lovable charlie buckets adventures in the eccentric willy wonkas mysterious chocolate factory had previously been filmed as willy wonka and the chocolate factory in 1971 with gene wilder in the title role and its pleasing to see that tim burton as offered his own take on the beloved bestselling book     this highly imaginative colourful and visually stimulating film is as delightful from beginning to end as any chocolate bar willy wonka could ever dream of johnny depp is perfect as the oddball factory owner channeling michael jackson and freddie highmore is superb as the goldhearted charlie     burton and team ensure that theres plenty of fun to be had here

Jan 6 2013,negative,tim burton should stay away from remaking movies because his versions of sleepy hollow planet of the apes and this suck still burton is one of my old faves so i had to check outand i was pissed cool set design is the only thing going for it the normally great danny elfman has a weak score and the oompa loompa songs suck johnny depp is at his most uninspired as wonka gene wilder is rolling in his grave and he isnt even dead yet not the worst thing that i ever saw but the original is so dear to my heart that this piece of shit should go on walkabout and never come back the kids are lameyou know whati cant go on with this because i really have nothing good to saygood to see christopher lee but wonkas back story is bad

Dec 7 2012,negative,wilder was a better wonka
Dec 7 2012,negative,not burtons best but at least in the vein unlike some of his other film in the 21st century ive always kind of preferred burtons movies over a lot of others in spite of the fact that when it comes right down to it he really is more style over substance  still i think his films particularly edward scissorhands demonstrate how fantasies can sometimes represent and elicit real everyday emotions better even than a film that tries hard to stay ensconced in the real world
Dec 7 2012,positive,i am a huge fan of tim burton and thought that although it wasnt necessarily originial his vision for the film was unique the film stays true to the book while giving it that goofy burtonesque style fun ill add that im not a huge fan of the original and that i get a weird vibe from that movie

Nov 23 2012,positive,johnny depp is so hot
Nov 23 2012,neutral,visual appeal and slightly improved accuracy to the novel aside what is most dissapointing here is the characters freddie highmores performance of charlie bares no resemblance to that of the novels character and becomes infuriatingly stubborn and naive as much as i admire johnny depp the willy wonka that the script gave him to portray is just wrong  too immature camp and offputting
Nov 23 2012,neutral,its more faithful to the book but it cant beat the nostalgia even if the story could use some of the great visuals and updated songs
Nov 23 2012,positive,loved the original  good update of the same story

Nov 21 2012,positive,i personally enjoy anything johnny depp does his way with humour is amazing and any he has just a broad range of characters i think the original movie is a classic but burton does a great job with the visual effects of this movie and sticks to the original dark sense that the book actually had  this is a more accurate depiction i laugh at this movie and am amazed at the visuals and it still retains a great moral in the end

Nov 16 2012,positive,charlie and the chocolate factorydirected by  tim burtonstarring  johnny deppwilly wonka                    freddie highmore charlie bucket                  david kelly grandpa joegenre  sffantasy the production year  2005 production country  americadistributed by  warner bros picturesoutline a poor child charlie is looking forward to eating the chocolate with his family on his birthday and the chocolate is made by willy wonka the factory owner willy wonka invites the children who drew one of the five golden tickets enclosed with the chocolate sold all over the world to a factory tour a child called augustus got ticket no 1 he likes to eat chocolate and he is a german overweight boy then veluka also got a ticket and she is a large rich persons selfish daughter then violet is not satisfied unless she takes no 1 the fourth person mike is a game nerd then charlie got the last ticket from this strange event charlie will begin to visit to a factory tour with his grandfather and will meet the factory manager willy wonka the five children met with various happenings inside the factory and one by one they dropped outfinally charlie remained safely in fact wonka was looking for his successor so he proposed that charlie become his successor once charlie rejected his proposal but in the end he accepted the conditionsreview tim burton made this movie as a screen version of juvenile literature secret of a chocolate factory while seeing inside the factory i thought it was exciting because inside the factory looks very colorful and looks very sweet so we can be pleased by the special effects heremoreover the characters which work at the factory were created by the clever and dark direction of tim burton this is a very effective point of the filmthe scene that is impressive is where the oompaloompas were dancing and singing after the child encountered a terrible experience that song and dance has wittiness and humorthe characters were individual except for charlie in the story although children other than charlie encountered terrible experiences it is very didactic and interesting the eccentric role of johnny depp is also a highlight of the filmas a result i think this movie can be enjoyed both by adults and children

Nov 6 2012,negative,what have you done to willy wonka you miserable bastards
Nov 6 2012,positive,grade a    johnny depp is brilliant as the dark and eccentric willy wonka in this i thought that the cast was great especially the kids little freddie highmore gives a terrific performance as charlie bucket charlie and the chocolate factory based on the novel by roald dahl is about a poverty stricken young boy named charlie whose wins a rare golden ticket to visit willy wonkas chocolate factory amongst him joining the visit of the chocolate factory are the other ticket winners a group of rude and spoilt children i think that at times the film is too dark creepy and malicious especially for much younger children i would probably say its not really suitable for kids under the age of nine or ten however the film does project some important lessons that kids and adults alike can learn from     i did think the film was a bit too morose at times but it gets its point across and the acting and the story are great i also thought that the visuals were amazing i thought that the chocolate factory looked out of this world technology has come far since the first charlie and the chocolate factory film where the chocolate factory looked awful i loved the use of colour and vibrancy in the film made it visually spectacular to watch charlie and the chocolate factory is definitely a film that hardcore chocaholics will love this film will have you dreaming about chocolate

Oct 28 2012,positive,not as good as the original
Oct 28 2012,positive,not normally my cup of tea but must admit enjoyed the bright and brash remake with a super performance by johnny depp captures the atmosphere of days gone by and a dark charm that seemed to be gone from films forever
Oct 27 2012,positive,pretty great remake from burton his only good one charlie and the chocolate factory is a wonderful and visually dazzling film for the decade
Oct 27 2012,positive,i loved this vivid visual feast for the eyes as well as depps portrayal of the zany yet lovable willy wonka  mumbler
Oct 27 2012,positive,the visions of dahl and burton perfectly complement each other please see wes andersons fantastic mr fox as a point of direct contrast here and the film is therefore faithful to the book in a modern transposition for instance the updating of violet beauregarde and mike teevee are prefect and fully faithful to dahls characters it is acerbic funny unsettling with a good fondant centre immeasurably superior to the gene wilde version i grew up with  however the british accents referring to candy grates massively please choose one or the other
Oct 27 2012,negative,almost unwatchable at times  if i had a kid who enjoyed this i would be concerned  stick to shows like superfriends if looking for good childrens entertainment
Oct 26 2012,positive,seen it when i was a kid the origanl one
Oct 25 2012,neutral,johnny depp is really creepy it kind of ruined the rest of the movie for me
Oct 25 2012,positive,thought it was really funny but they dident show parts from the origanal in it
Oct 25 2012,positive,each childparent set in charlie and the chocolate factory reveals its dysfunction portrayed in broad cartoonist strokes the kids cruelties serve as comedy though theyre not always funny indeed the noncharlie children are so loathsome that their various punishments seem deserved these are staged as songanddance numbers by the oompa loompas modelled after scenes that some parents will recall from other venues

Oct 23 2012,positive,true to the spirit of roald dahl and that is exactly how i felt when i left the theater and i feel exactly how i feel now
Oct 23 2012,neutral,while tim burtons vision is excellent this film holds no candle to the original willy wonka and the chocolate factory while the imagery is good and the same themes are there johnny depps wonka comes across more as creepy than whimsical and eccentric introducing a subplot about wonka and his father that lead to his obsession with candy feels forced at best and distracting from the main plot at worst
Oct 23 2012,positive,for tim burton i was a little dissapointed
Oct 23 2012,positive,i loved this movie when i was younger
Oct 23 2012,positive,not a bad remake but the original is still better
Oct 22 2012,positive,i loved this movie i like how depp plays willy wonka like an eccentric child the script which stays close to roald dahls style than the first movie and tim burtons iconic visuals
Oct 21 2012,positive,really good didnt like that they added willy wonkas childhood due to the fact that it was never in the original movie nor in the book all in all awesome movie but it will never top the original

Oct 17 2012,negative,johnny depp is just creepy in this movie
Oct 16 2012,negative,i dont care if roald dahl would have preferred this version nor do i care that there are burton fans who will swear on their lives that this version is superior to the 1971 version and insult you for preferring the earlier version i think this version sucks its not particularly charming there annoying jokes inappropriate innuendos which are also annoying bad acting this film makes johnny depp seem like a pedophile and overall its just annoying and boring its not a horrible film but i still think its a bad film
Oct 16 2012,positive,haha johnny is so funny in this movie it still makes me laugh and ive seen it so many times
Oct 15 2012,positive,own it  the part fits johnny depp

Oct 9 2012,positive,although i know very little about the background when it comes to willy wonka and the chocolate factory i was still able to thoroughly enjoy this excellent film i especially loved how there seemed to be quite a few messages behind what was happening and it was gratifying seeing kids get what they deserve for being repulsive johnny depp is fantastic in his portrayal he is always able to give such a great performance when he plays characters that are over the top he is incredibly amusing and his bluntness towards the children is absolutely hilarious very visually appealing along with danny elfmans genius music this movie is great entertainment for all ages
Oct 9 2012,positive,i think that the ending could have been better

Sep 20 2012,positive,tim burtons adaptation of the roald dahl book has some promising elements to it but you end up feeling more couldve been accomplished whilst ill give credit to the visuals and deep roys portrayal of the oompaloompas johnny depp is uncomfortably creepy and meanspirited as willy wonka and even if it follows the book more closely than the original adaptation the original is still the definitive version

Aug 27 2012,negative,interesting but the original is way better

Aug 25 2012,positive,my kids love this movie
Aug 25 2012,positive,while there are some things different than the 1971 classic version charlie and the chocolate factory is still a decent version of the willy wonka story thanks to an interesting script premise and dialogue a wonderful performance by johnny depp as willy wonka brilliant directing by tim burton weird songs by danny elfman burtons long time composer collaborator beautiful sets and locations inside the factory and amazing visual effects that all children and aduls will enjoy
Aug 25 2012,positive,though i love johnny depp the original with gene wilder still reigns supreme but that being said this not only stayed faithful to its source material it updated somethings along the way such as two of the kids being updated to a winner with soccer mom and a kid completely desensitized by society by logic and video games there is still this sweet presence to it to not have that wouldve made this movie fail miserably
Aug 25 2012,positive,loved th7s movie the 1st time around  still love it the 2nd johnny depp is perfect for this role

Aug 24 2012,negative,great another dark and exorbitant burton adaption crackingopen to a story that doesnt need to be cracked open it seems like nothing classic can be left alone it needs to be picked up turned upside down and shaken up and down to see if any loose change falls out regardless if it looks pretty i couldnt get over the modernization of a great classic

Aug 19 2012,positive,i dont care what anyone says this was a cool interpretation
Aug 19 2012,negative,a dull overdone poor interpretation of fantasy which is difficult to say about a tim burton piece
Aug 19 2012,negative,an insult to the original a 100 close ups of the overrated depp pulling strange faces doesnt save it
Aug 19 2012,positive,i thought it was a lot of fun
Aug 18 2012,negative,freaky movie not very good dont really like musicals
Aug 18 2012,neutral,weird  couldnt get what some scenes tones in voices or actions were suppose to be telling us  it seemed almost plasticky fake  not innocent but devilish
Aug 18 2012,neutral,not as good as the original

Aug 15 2012,positive,good film just like the willy wonka 1971 they modernized everything and johnny depp portraying ww is superb another good tim burtonjohnny depp film
Aug 15 2012,negative,prefer the proginal but this one had johnny depp
Aug 15 2012,positive,charlie and the chocolate factory may capture the dark humor of the original book and can be entertaining at times but it overstays its welcome by a good half hour and johnny depps performance is more distracting than whimsical
Aug 15 2012,positive,funny just interesting
Aug 13 2012,positive,entertaining not only for kids but for adults as well  love this remake 
Aug 13 2012,negative,it was really odd
Aug 13 2012,negative,unfortunately its not the best depp movie
Aug 12 2012,positive,johnny depp although creepy is still hot
Aug 11 2012,positive,a strange but semi enjoyable viewing experience while i do appreciate burtons artistic style towards this film and i do like johnny depp i found the movie to be a bit too dark for its own good and sometimes being free from some humor or heart that made the original a class this is by no means a bad remake but sometimes the visuals can overshadow the heart and soul of the original
Aug 10 2012,negative,i wish gene wilder had played him in stead of johny
Aug 10 2012,positive,like the original with more to enjoy
Aug 10 2012,negative,the old one is better
Aug 9 2012,negative,it is assumed that better special effects and new talent would have to renew the film but actually it was more silly and preposterous totally different from the 70s film
Aug 9 2012,positive,tim burton at his best and awesome adaptation from the novel
Aug 9 2012,positive,quite impressive overall  im not a huge burton fan but his style seems wellsuited to the source material here  there are a few minor issues i have the largest of which is that the tunnel scene wasnt dark and scary enough
Aug 8 2012,positive,very amusingkids were love it i know i did
Aug 8 2012,positive,a movie about a poor boy who ends up owning a chocolate factory willy wonkas factory that is
Aug 8 2012,negative,the original was why better even if it is from the 70s
Aug 8 2012,negative,the first movie with gene wilder is better
Aug 7 2012,positive,i liked this ok it was closer to the original story by roald dahl but kinda fell flat in places
Aug 7 2012,positive,there he is again love johnny depp
Aug 7 2012,positive,not as good as the original but still excellent   i also really liked that they developed willy wonkas character more in this one
Aug 7 2012,negative,lacks the magic and warmth of the 1971 film losing itself in special effects perhaps in tailoring itself to a more american audience
Aug 7 2012,negative,how can johnny depp replace the original
Aug 7 2012,positive,not as good as the original
Aug 6 2012,neutral,again depp saves this clunker
Aug 6 2012,positive,prefered the originalmmmm
Aug 6 2012,neutral,i still like the original
Aug 6 2012,positive,fun dark but johnny depps performance i did not like
Aug 5 2012,positive,sweetly acted tim burtons remake is a stirring achievement nice and chocolatey gooey and lovely
Aug 5 2012,neutral,the rodents are scary
Aug 5 2012,positive,an interesting look at roald dahls classic
Aug 4 2012,negative,made me mad  i thought it was going to be a story of charlie growing up so why the remake  yuck
Aug 4 2012,positive,depps role is eccentric but very delectable
Aug 4 2012,positive,theres somethin about a tim burton flick  oh why didnt you do the last two batman movies
Aug 4 2012,negative,i like the original too much
Aug 3 2012,positive,it may not be the original but the original isnt this either
Aug 3 2012,positive,i want some chocolate now tt haha
Aug 2 2012,positive,good morning starshine the earth says hello
Aug 2 2012,positive,johnny depp was perfect in this movie  he completely nailed the personality that willy wonka needed to have
Aug 2 2012,positive,good songs but so damn scary  shiver
Aug 1 2012,negative,compared to the old one the kids now would like this one but it was okay
Aug 1 2012,positive,i love this one because it is so random and funny
Aug 1 2012,neutral,freakishly great movie
Aug 1 2012,positive,i think that it is a good remake the acting was good its perfect for kids and for adults i think that over all it was a medium film that was not great but good
Jul 31 2012,positive,i think johnny depp is real sexy in this movie lolz
Jul 30 2012,negative,i like the original better
Jul 30 2012,negative,im not sure why i end up seeing every film that tim burton churns out  most of them end up being somewhat sloppy  burtons darker more faithful adaptation of roald dahls classic novel is visually stunning and features another classic performance by johnny depp but its quirks and zaniness feel hollow  was this movie made for kids  adults  none of the above  i couldnt really figure it out  however it is nice to see an homage not only to the novel itself but the original film adaptation as well  im the first to admit that the first film is extremely twisted and unlike this one im pretty sure those kids get slaughtered when they screw up in the factory but there was something magical about the bizarre nature of the original film that this one fails to capture
Jul 30 2012,positive,odd rather trippy but a great movie nonetheless more movies need to have characters such as this
Jul 30 2012,positive,charlie and the chocolate factory has a great cast impressive special effects dark tone and a closer touch to the book
Jul 30 2012,positive,real weird but it was good
Jul 30 2012,negative,sucked  the original is so much better  oompa loompas were the best part of the movie and they werent the same in this version  kind of a darker version of the original
Jul 30 2012,positive,this movie does so much right yet so much wrong i think with a great visionary director like burton these movie could have been fantastic but the movie fails to capture you with its immense sillyness putrid soundtrack and annoying backstories that take away the mystery and imagination of willy wonka overall i still enjoyed watching the movie and it isnt a bad film just not very good either
Jul 29 2012,negative,kind of good  i saw the old version a long time ago
Jul 29 2012,positive,weird yet not terrifyingly so like the gene wilder one
Jul 29 2012,positive,parodies and jokes are all great  tims craziness met johnnys craziness again    the only drawback you could say is that people might think this is for their child but its not they can watch of course but they wouldnt catch the movies  and it often mislead people to think they are watching something that was supposed to be a family movie i think that contributed on this low rating this and tims distinctive style i think its a shame    but since when tims movies are for children anyway  its really great
Jul 29 2012,positive,this one is waaaaaaaaaaayyyyyy better than the first
Jul 29 2012,positive,good movie  not like the original
Jul 29 2012,positive,burtons devious humour and depps neurotic wonka is a delight but this version feels a bit like a flashy goodlooking but rather hollow adaptation
Jul 28 2012,positive,it was good for awhile
Jul 28 2012,positive,way better than willy wonka in the sense that tim burtons version actually follows the book johnny depp is hilarious and adds his odd charm to this film a must see if youre a fan of the book if you like willy wonka youll probably want to skip
Jul 28 2012,positive,great movie family movie
Jul 28 2012,neutral,you cant beat the original
Jul 28 2012,negative,its not even worth the half a starjust horrible
Jul 27 2012,positive,anything with depp in it is good

Jul 27 2012,positive,old version awesome new one yet to watch
Jul 27 2012,positive,really good remake johnny was wicked playing mr wonker but can never beat originals
Jul 26 2012,neutral,charlie and the chocolate factory is a decent interpretation of the childrens classic thats also unappealing dull and predictable
Jul 26 2012,positive,a good attempt in a remake
Jul 25 2012,negative,ugh dear god i hate this movie it certainly has some good parts in it but overall a very bad movie i almost hated it how can you take out the oompa loompas signature song
Jul 25 2012,negative,i thought this movie was just straight up terrible so much that i just couldnt finish it
Jul 25 2012,negative,i am a fan of the original and this movie was just too creepy  i couldnt get through it

Jul 15 2012,neutral,beautiful to look at and jd again takes a chance this time playing an unlikable nonsympathetic lead  unfortunately its not that good  it did give us freddie highmore though
Jul 14 2012,positive,is it as good or memorable as willy wonka probably not but i love the music atmosphere casting and i think this movie works pretty well while i prefer freddie highmore as charlie over peter ostrum gene wilder will always be wonka johnny depp often came across as creepy almost a michael jacksontype

Jul 9 2012,positive,good attempt but it doesnt live up to the charm and lovability of the original version  an interesting new interpretation of wonka by johnny depp

Jul 4 2012,positive,it was a reasonably entertaining piece by common pair burton and depp and probably better embraced by the modern people than the first rendition depps performance is a little uncomfortable to watch at times however and the oompa loompas could be a little insensitive or racist
Jul 4 2012,positive,this one sucks i like the original story  plus johnny depp looks girly in this
Jul 4 2012,positive,nice story and  nice performances
Jul 4 2012,positive,really good liked this one better than original

Jul 1 2012,positive,not bad as far as crappy remakes come
Jul 1 2012,positive,one of my favorite kids movies burton did a great job with this i think
Jun 30 2012,positive,good interpretation of the book
Jun 29 2012,positive,a classic that will love on forever
Jun 29 2012,positive,burtons mover is definitely a closer adaption of the novel than the original and to me it was a much better film all round as i was never a fan of the original burton recruits his friend and frequent collaborator johnny depp to play willy wonka and depp is fun and weird as wonka but sometimes he strays a little bit to much towards the dark side and the tale of his relationship with his father is definitely something that should have been left out of the movie     the plot is the same as the original adaption of the film but burton stays truer to the book disappointly the songs the oompaloompas sing arent the same as the original film but they are the ones from the book and danny elfman is on the very top of his game in composing the songs each with their own distinctive genre depps portrayal of wonka while a little too dark at times is more in line with the wonka in dahls book and his creepy mannerisms are thoroughly enjoyable to watch the movie however is made so sweet and brilliant by the casting of freddie highmore as the titular charlie highmore makes this movie by playing the sweet loving kindhearted charlie exactly the way the book portrays him and that was one of the main appeals of this film to me and burtons overall direction of the young cast is fantastic    as per usual with burtons film its beautiful visually and has elements of darkness throughout which as aforementioned should probably be left out and there was no need for the inclusion of wonkas father as it is not in the book and it felt like christopher lee was cast in the role to give depp some more screen time nevertheless burtons charlie is a brilliant film but i feel that due to most peoples love of the original it will never get the credit it deserves
Jun 29 2012,positive,i still like the original a lot better depp feels really out of place but the tim burton look and the elfman sound is not at all amiss
Jun 28 2012,positive,johnny depp can make any movie amazing
Jun 28 2012,positive,kewl dont think he was a gay guy tho
Jun 28 2012,negative,not his best i thought michel jackdson was iin the movie
Jun 27 2012,positive,interesting
Jun 27 2012,positive,hoped it was alittle better than it was
Jun 27 2012,negative,there are very few films that are so recognised that they cannot be remade this remake is full of flaws and doesnt even hit the standards of the orignal classic the visuals on certain characters is unbelieveably poorits completely obvious the songs are not very clever and are no way near as iconic as the original the biggest problem was johnny depp unfortunately he just didnt fit the role of willy wonka espescially compared to gene wilder people keep claiming that this remake has a darker atmosphere this i completely disagree with the originals nightmare tunnel scene is more iconic and terrifying than anything this film could come up with
Jun 26 2012,positive,pretty good  i loved the original but this version is not too bad
Jun 26 2012,neutral,the damn oompa loompas were extrememly annoying
Jun 26 2012,positive,i loved this movielittle girl when i saw it

Jun 24 2012,positive,not as good as the original but still good
Jun 24 2012,negative,when doing remakes doing it differently to be different is not always the best the ending gave a little bit more of a cap willy i did not believe had to be such an open book of emotions let the audience put two and two together
Jun 24 2012,positive,willy wonka is better but this is still good
Jun 24 2012,negative,the new show is retarded
Jun 23 2012,positive,enertaining but had a bit too much spectacular sights than spectacular story though more accurate than the 70s version
Jun 22 2012,positive,wonkas motiv is to murder all the children

Jun 19 2012,positive,fantastic it is tim burton at his best johnny depp is almost as good as gene wilder in the role of the worlds most famous chocolatier
Jun 19 2012,negative,this is where the burtondepp thing became unbearable
Jun 18 2012,negative,seriously did tim burton have family audiences in mind when he made this film nothing about this film is familyfriendly opening credits that are spooky rather than whimsical puppets that look like corpses when they melt characters who are creepy instead of funny graphic references to psycho mr burton what were you thinking
Jun 18 2012,negative,not big on the director  it was well made johnny depp is the only thing that made it worth watching the oompa lumpas were just weird not as good as the original
Jun 18 2012,positive,what a wonderful imaginative fun ride

Jun 18 2012,positive,i liked the original a bit better but johnny depp simply cant fail in a movie
Jun 18 2012,positive,i find it ironic that this film is more about wonka and the wonka entitled film is more about charlie although this film does follow the book while this doesnt come close to being as good as the original because the other film seemed more family sunday afternoon and this seems friday evening if the movie so happens to be on the tv just watch it youll probably get more enjoyment then i did the visuals and thematic tone are very good as was the music the oompa loompa songs were creative as each one took on an era of time the acting was good besides freddie highmore as the script for him was one of holier then thou and a kid who doesnt do anything wrong that could be the point but it reaches levels of absurdity and his acting was wooden
Jun 18 2012,positive,just right for children silly and fun
Jun 18 2012,positive,mi man is in this 1 2
Jun 18 2012,positive,not the best played out movie i have seen but it is defiantly worth a watch

Jun 12 2012,positive,a great reimagining by tim burton
Jun 12 2012,negative,cg umpalompasthats all i have to say
Jun 12 2012,negative,a dissapointment that doesnt even compare to the original  who cares about which was closer to the book  as a movie this was a falure
Jun 12 2012,positive,kind of almost scarybut i was afraid of the original too

Jun 11 2012,negative,every actor has a bad acting moment johnny depp this is yours
Jun 11 2012,positive,again tim burton is a freakin genius
Jun 11 2012,positive,it was very colorful and depp was adequately creepy but i think it was a little heavy handed with the message  i actually wanted it to be a little more dark chocolaty fun but it was good for what it was even though it will always be compared to the original film instead of the book it came from  but as long as burton and depp keep making movies ill go see them
Jun 10 2012,negative,doesnt live up to the original
Jun 10 2012,positive,like the first one better but johnny was good
Jun 10 2012,positive,we are the dreamers of dreams
Jun 10 2012,positive,it possesses a far creepier tone than the 1971 film willy wonka and the chocolate factory but it sticks to the book a bit better
Jun 10 2012,positive,yeah ok i know this doesnt really deserve a 5 star but johnnys in it so therefore its a possibility
Jun 10 2012,negative,doesnt even come close to touching gene wilder
Jun 10 2012,positive,i love how creepy willy wonka is in this version and charlie is perfect
Jun 10 2012,positive,nice visuals and interesting characters
Jun 10 2012,negative,hated it  the original is so much better

Jun 9 2012,positive,ompa lompa was creepy but johny depp was funny
Jun 9 2012,positive,me and the kids love this movie   its weird   candy is dandy but licker is quicker
Jun 9 2012,negative,i expected it to be more like the first
Jun 9 2012,negative,only saved by johnny depps weirdness
Jun 8 2012,positive,i didnt grow up with the 1971 version so i didnt watch this comparing it during the entire movie id only seen it once prior to seeing this version this is much darker that the original which i like as it stuck to the dark nature of the novel i have seen the original and while i do like it its pretty stupid this film while creepy is undeniably clever i have mixed feelings about depps performance but freddie highmore gives a wonderful performance as charlie the rest of the cast does well too the visuals are stunning especially the chocolate river special mention goes out to danny elfmans music    a lot of people hate this movie and id be lying if i said i didnt understand why its dark its strange often unnervingly creepy and its just so different from the original that it could change the views that some may of it id say that youll have a better chance of liking this film if you didnt grow up with willy wonka being your childhood classic or if youve read roald dahls works and appreciate how dark they are
Jun 8 2012,positive,loved loved loved it  more than the original i believe  johnny depp was compelling and creepy in a likable way
Jun 7 2012,neutral,this one was true to the book not as interesting though
Jun 7 2012,positive,i enjoyed the older version more but johnny depp and tim burton never fail to make me happy the songs are all catchy and the acting is great
Jun 7 2012,negative,like charlie and the chocolate factory but johhny depp scaress me in this movie but hes so hot in other films
Jun 7 2012,positive,i thought it was much better than the old version
Jun 7 2012,positive,i saw the original 60s version so im comparing it to that as well as its own merits  the movie is good expecially depp and that guy who played the ompaloompas  the film is really a morality lesson appropriate for kids teaching them lessons like not to be greedy or impatient  depps michael jacksonlike wonka is a bit creepy but in a cool kinda way  the film is a bit short in time but it overall a wonderful film
Jun 7 2012,positive,the original was a lot better to me but johnny depp did an excellent job
Jun 7 2012,positive,this movie was funnypaula
Jun 7 2012,positive,as with usual tim burton and johnny depp collaborations its as weird as heck creepy and somewhat disturbing but depp is charming enough to forgive most of it
Jun 7 2012,positive,somewhat interesting but was disappointed overall
Jun 7 2012,negative,i loved freddie highmore and anna sophia robb thats all i have to say about it doesnt even compare to the original i dont think tim burton has the right eye for childrens films because everything that ive seen that is meant for children that is directed by him falls flat every time maybe its that i dont see what others do but this disappointed me considering the fact that i love tim burtons films sorry but i dont like this one
Jun 7 2012,negative,the only part i liked was the fire
Jun 6 2012,positive,kinda creepy in a funny way
Jun 6 2012,positive,although i love johnny he was kinda wierdbut still hot
Jun 6 2012,positive,a fantastic adaptation of a fantastic book the additions that strengthen wonkas back story seem to fit right in with the original story unlike the annoying additions in the 1971 film
Jun 6 2012,positive,burton developed an innovative smart catchy film with charlie and the chocolate factory
Jun 5 2012,negative,diassapointing when compared to the original had high hopes that were quickly dashed among the rubble with this one
Jun 5 2012,positive,eeek johnny depp plays it so well in tim burtons version of this movie i love watching all his expressions
Jun 5 2012,negative,why did they mess with this movie  though i like johnny deppi really did not like him in this movie

Jun 1 2012,negative,a really bad remake i generally dislike remakes but this one left more than a bad taste in my mouth depp couldnt save this one nor could burton who seemed to flounder with the material he tried to make it dark ala burton style but it felt contrived and poorly realized

May 31 2012,positive,its not as good as the gene wilder one but still very good  almost everything in the movie was well done and that includes danny elfmans oompaloompa songs  even the child actors and actresses were good at their parts  my personal favorite was the little girl who played veruca salt  they really got the right girl for that role  there were only two problems with the movie  the worst problem is willy wonka  though johnny depp did excellent on his role this wonka is not the wonka from the book  hes selfish a bit gay which was unneeded and disturbingly childish in the nick jrpbs kids kind of way  he was funny though  but the back story about wonkas childhood was extremely unneeded  the movie wouldve done just fine without it  the second problem though not big enough to dumb down the movie was the oompaloompas language  but everything else in the movie is put together very well

May 24 2012,positive,it was never going to be better than the original but enjoyable
May 24 2012,negative,gone is the magic wonder and charm of the original hear now is a film stylized modernized and ultimately very forgettable film it may be closer to the original but it is far from a smart film sometimes changing a book for a move is a good thing this film is proof this is just tim burton putting his stamp on a classic if you were to ask me he was the wrong choice someone like chris columbus would have been better suited to direct this then again did we really need a remake of this film i leave you with those thoughts
May 24 2012,positive,johnny depp once again does a good acting job   he plays an incredible willy wonka

May 16 2012,negative,do not remake classics  especially you tim burton
May 16 2012,positive,a display of johnny depps versatility as an actor  particularly if taken into retrospect with his portrayal of captain jack sparrow virtually night and day  however the multitude of singing and dancing midgets tends to slow it down a bit

May 14 2012,positive,the original as well
May 14 2012,negative,i remember reading somewhere that roald rahl never liked the 1971 adaptation of his book because too much emphasis was placed on the willy wonka character even if this version uses the novels actual title the film is too much in love with depp who does no justice to wilders much earlier performance
May 14 2012,positive,the original was better
May 14 2012,negative,the original is much much better
May 13 2012,negative,the orginal was better
May 13 2012,positive,more of a dissapointment but overall not a bad movie nothing like the original
May 13 2012,positive,i grew up with gene wilder as wonka i loved the quirky creepy man i am thrilled that burton depp and carter created their own completely reimagined chocolate factory and differently creepy wonka an old story for new times i would add for those who say that it does not keep to the original read the book this version is truer to dahls novel
May 13 2012,positive,another depp classic
May 13 2012,negative,couldnt rate it any lower but wish i could take stars away
May 12 2012,positive,i like this film a lot and it had me smiling giggling and laughing all the way through it seems like a lot of people have problems with this adaptation frankly i dont get it this may not be one of johnny depps best or finest performances but certainly one of his wackiest ones and hes real good at it its directed by tim burton and there are burton stamps all over the film it is immeasurably colorful and yet gleefully twisted and dark but at the heart of it is a touching story about family love freddie highmore does a good job playing a sweet and goodhearted kid charlie and the rest of the cast does a solid job loved the visuals loved burtons direction and i thoroughly enjoyed all the musical numbers sang by ooompaloompas charlie and the chocolate factory is a delightful movie

May 12 2012,positive,i loved this movie with a sweet passion seeing as how i think johnny depp is the most sexiest man alive and him playing in this movie and the role he had to play as willy wonka made me want to watch the dvd over and over again the way he did those 4 children was not right but each one of them deserved their just desserts

Apr 30 2012,neutral,it is more faithful to roald dahls creation in terms of visuals songs and oompaloompas plus the chosen cast of child actors are clearly suited to their roles yet burton seems to lose track of good storytelling focusing too much of highstake visuals and complete ignoring of the laws of physics also elfmans take on dahls lyrics are creepy and unmemorable unlike those of the first films

Apr 10 2012,positive,im writing this review very late i watched it a few years ago but the movie turned out better than expected  my first impression was that of horror but after watching the whole thing i was pleasantly surprised with how enjoyable it was  i like the added back story to willy wonkas character though he looks um kind of creepy  but i found myself getting used to the pale strange look the makeup artists gave depp  but the oompa loompas were horrible terrible computerized and all sorts of wrong  those guys were ruined  they should have stuck with the original songs got multiple actors and avoided computers for the oompa loompas  but overall id recommend the movie  its similar to the original but not at all the same theyre both good in their own ways
Apr 10 2012,positive,a great remake of a classic film however some classics should remain untouched like the original movie it had just the right amount of magic that cannot be recreated in any type of technology

Apr 10 2012,positive,not as cool as the first one but its ok
Apr 10 2012,positive,in 1971 hollywood made a film adaptation of charlie and the chocolate factory by roald dahl as willy wonka and the chocolate factory needless to say that the film has become somewhat of a classic amongst families everywhere unfortunately if one does look at the movie now it clearly shows signs of age so in 2005 warner bros decided to remake this movie as charlie and the chocolate factory under the direction of tim burton now the criticism for this version has been mixed at best but if one takes a closer look at this film he or she will find that charlie and the chocolate factory is surprisingly better than willy wonka and the chocolate factory with a few exceptions the 2005 remake is a faithful adaptation of the book that entertains viewers up to the last minute    the story centers on a candy maker named willy wonka johnny depp one day mr wonka agrees to let five children into his factory five children find the tickets including a young boy named charlie bucket freddie highmore and are given a tour they will never forget    charlie and the chocolate factory is not a bad upgrade the supporting cast is much more modernized by giving the audience a look at what kids are like in todays society the adult supporting cast does a fine job as well tim burton seems like the natural choice to direct the film as there are a lot of zany moments happening on the screen danny elfmans music sets the tone for a kids movie as well as taking lyrics for the songs from the actual book speaking of the book the story actually follows the book closely there are scenes that are in the book like the nut room scene that are not in the original version this is because the original film was made on a somewhat constricted budget    speaking of the budget with the advancement of digital technology the visual and special effects look fantastic sometimes you cant tell whats real and whats fake it keeps you interested in whats going to happen next and when it does youre still amazed at how they did it charlie and the chocolate factory stays true to the source material as well as giving audiences some newer images to look at    with that being said there are two things that do not work for the movie one is a major complaint and the other is a minor complaint the minor complaint is the johnny depp is not willy wonka yes we get it that hes trying something new and original but it just doesnt work the major complaint is that there is a subplot in the story that focuses on wonkas past this feels forced and unnecessary and should not have been included in the final print    in conclusion charlie and the chocolate factory will satisfy those who life visual movies and fans of the original book there are some flaws with the film that could have easily been improved the original 1971 version may be a classic some peoples mind but for those looking for a true adaptation of the roald dahl book then you might want to check this one out
Apr 10 2012,positive,liked it enough to buy the dvd  
Apr 10 2012,positive,slightly creepy movie

Apr 4 2012,positive,i watched this again tonight and i realized that i like almost all of it i like the dark fantasy atmosphere i like all of the characters especially depps bizarre take on willy wonka the sets are fabulous the two things that i could do without are the obnoxious overblown songanddance numbers from the oompaloompas and the oddball outofleftfield additional back story for wonka himself what could he possibly need with a back story hes just fine being his eccentric mysterious self and they totally blew their chance for a sequel movie based on the sequel book but its a fun movie based on a fun book and i enjoy it whenever i watch it

Apr 4 2012,positive,not one of my favorite johnny depp movies but its good
Apr 4 2012,positive,expands on the horror of the original film without giving it away thats its a horror story charlie and the chocolate factory is a fantastic remake by making the world by it self seeming strange and unnerving the chocolate factory makes much more since as wankas insane world being the only sane place in the movie johhny depp does a great job making wanka childlike yet his death trap once again never feels forced my only 2 complains are the lompas looking far less like slaves like intended and seeing the kids effects in the original they were assumed to be dead and while one could argue that there side effects are a fate worse then death it leaves nothing to the imagination like in the original still a fantastic film that you have to walk into with the right mind to enjoy i just wish they added 2 more kids to round out the 7 deadly sins

Mar 31 2012,positive,anything with depp is good
Mar 31 2012,negative,the original was much better
Mar 31 2012,negative,willy wonka and the chocolate factory is an alltime classic that i watched countless times as a child this is simply a terrible remake nothing new to the storyline but the changes burton does make are for the worse taking out some key scenes of the original and adding in some more than unnecessary scenes in this darker toned abomination want something to brighten up your day watch the original want something that gets the plot but provides horridly forgettable alternative takes of it watch this
Mar 30 2012,positive,one of tim burtons best to this day
Mar 30 2012,positive,johnny depp  most versatile actor ever
Mar 30 2012,positive,xd i love johnny in this hahaha good morning sunshine the earth says hello 3
Mar 30 2012,neutral,it was ok but i like the original better
Mar 30 2012,positive,really one of the biggest problems with this film is the portrayal of wonka  hes turned from an intelligent snide mysterious and yet goodhearted man into a complete manchild and it completely detracts from the character
Mar 30 2012,positive,avoid thinking of the original film and you can have a lot of fun deep is magnificent in his bizarre take on the lead role and the children fulfill their roles well the shame is you feel burtons style is there on screen and yet it could have been so much more less restraint and braver choices with sets could have made this something special
Mar 29 2012,negative,i have a 9 year old bear with me
Mar 29 2012,negative,cannot even compare with the original  johnny depp should be ashamed
Mar 29 2012,negative,original only for me

Mar 23 2012,negative,terrible and creepy
Mar 23 2012,positive,i thought i would hate it but it was actually okay probly wouldnt have liked it as much if not for johnny depp it was a ton better than the original
Mar 22 2012,positive,great movie d johnny depps acting as willy wonka is brilliant p
Mar 19 2012,positive,nice remake of the classic novel by dahl and of course of the first willy wonka and the chocolate factory the special effects makes the movie really worth watching and even though the oompa loompas arent that weird as in the first movie they are quite funny but theres no doubt that the main reason to watch this movie is the following johnny depp he suits perfectly in the eccentric as usual for johnny character that is willy wonka
Mar 18 2012,positive,not as good as the gene wilder version but a good movie and this one is a lot closer to the book
Mar 18 2012,positive,yet again if u know me
Mar 18 2012,negative,this movie had its good moments here and there but not much to actually be called a movie overall this movie was a big insult to the original willy wonka was annoying and creepy the kind of guy you wouldnt want your kids around the kids personalities didnt feel genuine charlie wasnt sweet and innocent like in the original hes sad and deeply depressed the movie was quite still cold and boring but of course hollywood tries to distract its simpleminded audience with overrated computer graphics glitz and pop culture this movie was such a slap in the face but im pretty sure little kids like it and probably dont even know that the original exist
Mar 18 2012,neutral,nothing on the original
Mar 18 2012,neutral,not my thing really
Mar 17 2012,positive,tim burton is perfect for this sort of material wacky curious colorful and a lot of fun with a hint of darkness a visually appealing film which is thankfully more faithful to the book than the lessthanstellar original film johnny depp is fantastic in this
Mar 16 2012,negative,i was disappointed in johnny
Mar 15 2012,positive,its pretty gooda lot darker thatn the original but thats a good thing in this case
Mar 15 2012,negative,not really bad but the original is so much better
Mar 14 2012,positive,i love love this movie it is the best movie ever you should wach it
Mar 13 2012,negative,everything is wrong with this film and this story is too happy and cheerful to be directed by tim burton see the original 1971 version if you want the real story of willy wonka
Mar 13 2012,negative,this movie sucked it completly took away the imagination of the original like all movies theses days it was done to high tech and lost alot of the madic us older people remember as children
Mar 12 2012,negative,first one was better
Mar 11 2012,positive,those look alike oompa loompas were freakier than the original ones
Mar 11 2012,positive,johnny depp gives it his all in this bizarre but fairly accurate adaptation of the roald dahl classic
Mar 9 2012,positive,funny movie johnny depp was perfect as willie
Mar 9 2012,positive,johnny depp is better than any chocolate
Mar 9 2012,positive,a lot better then i thought it was watch it with low expectation and wait to be blown away
Mar 9 2012,positive,if johnny depp wast in it it would be starless
Mar 8 2012,positive,keeps closer to actual story line from the book and fewer stupid songs than the original
Mar 7 2012,positive,eh definitely not one of burtons best entries the main attraction here is the visual eye candy but depps portrayal of wonka is rather strained the supporting cast does a pretty good job and the defeat of each child is horrific as it is delightful ultimately the movie could have been better had depps character been a lot less airyfairy and indifferent to the children
Mar 7 2012,positive,quite a good film and quite funny
Mar 7 2012,positive,although it is nothing like the original i still liked it thought it was pretty good
Mar 7 2012,negative,go watch the original
Mar 6 2012,positive,better the willy wonka and the chocolate factory
Mar 6 2012,positive,its better then the old one
Mar 4 2012,neutral,havent seen all of it yet
Mar 4 2012,negative,not as good as the original
Mar 4 2012,positive,visually this is an amazing filmeasily one of the best ive ever scene film wiseits also not bad granted its not as good as the 1980s film but its still good i think burtons usual flair of taking a story and adding his little twist on it was good i always like how he can take a film like this and make it slightly darkgranted he didnt do as good a job on it as say batman or sleepy hollow but this is done well    deeps performance is also quite well donei would say its on par with wilders performance and i loved how burton put the bigger emphases on willy as a character then the other film it was interesting to me to see burton go deeper into the character and give him an actual back story    now all that aside though i still dont think its as good as the original but not by much its still an impressive film and fun to watch but i think the one downsidemaybe even a positive depending on how you look at it was the emphases of willy in the other one it was more on charlie but this one it was different and as i said it worked and made the film great but i think some people that saw the original maybe turned off by this film because of the emphasis on the willy character i personally wasnt and still found the film enjoyable and visual great but i think the original has a better story at the root at least this one is great to but unless your going into the film looking to see more of a back story on willy wonkawhich if i remember right the book did then dont see this you may get bored by it but if you want to see a visually great film with interesting characters see this
Mar 4 2012,negative,to me it ruins willy wonka and the chocolate factory   it is no where near where willy wonka and the chocolate factory is   just so you know im 13 not someone who grew up with it
Mar 4 2012,positive,with the release of frankenweenie in the near future i am going to  take a look at the last few tim burton movies to see his fall from  grace i will not be reviewing sweeney todd as i have not seen it yet  lets begin with what many people consider a bad movie charlie and the  chocolate factory charlie and the chocolate factory is a movie i dont understand all the hate for the movie is slightly less inventive then the 1971 versionbut that was a very tough act to follow the good things in this movie outweigh the bad and the bad things are problems in most to all tim burton movies but are just more noticeable here the story of this movie is one everyone knows the great candy man willy wonka puts out five golden tickets to take a tour of his until now closed factory the tickets go to augustus gloop the glutton of a boy violet beauregarde the competitive girl veruca salt the spoiled one mike teevee a smart but mean gamer and charlie bucket the poor little boy the story is of course timeless and we discover the factory along with the kids great story the good parts outshine the bad the acting is good grandpa joe is pretty funny and so are mr salt and willy wonka the kids are ok nothing special even charlie himself is only average i like the oompa loompas the effects are amazing and the songs while not as good as the original are great i do enjoy the factory it is very cool and colorful and some other sets are nice overall good stuff   the bad in this movie are noticeable but are bad things in almost  every tim burton some sets do kind of twist around each otherwhile  not as annoying as it was in batman it is still very distracting the  movie also has way to many characters the other grandparents mrs  gloop mr teevee and mrs beauregarde are all just there and have  absolutely no importance to the story there is also a side story about  wonkas past which is just dumb and it has a very disappointing payoff  and the endingwow the ending is just terrible but these are  problems for most burton movies so yeah they are bad but not  distinctly to this movie overall i like this movie it has a great story good acting and fairly good sets the problems are very noticeable but these problems are used in every tim burton movie i enjoy this movie and is defiantly on my list of movies i like that everyone else hates roald dahl would be satisfied
Mar 4 2012,negative,watchable but no one could play willie wonka as well as gene wilder did see potc review about johnny depp
Mar 3 2012,negative,this movie is very bad
Mar 3 2012,positive,i seen charlie and the choclate factory and realy thought it was a really funny and good movie
Mar 3 2012,positive,i loved the original film but there is a finesse about this one that really shines through   deep at his very best with some great humour along the way
Mar 3 2012,positive,certainly a visual feast and a delight to watch with the special extended storyline and imagination it makes you want to go into willy wonkas chocolate factory and see it for yourself    willy wonka is definitely a complex character and johnny depp gave us a refreshing portrait of this familyless chocolatier this tying in with charlie a familyoriented boy sparked an interesting twist of reuniting willy and his dentist father    tim burton had made it more difficult to any successor wishing to make a remake in the future burtons interpretation of the original story and the reference to the original the chocolate factory movie was subtle yet reminiscent
Mar 3 2012,positive,not as good as gene wilder but ok
Mar 2 2012,negative,sucks compared to 1st one
Mar 2 2012,positive,probably one of the best spot on remakes ive seen obviously there were things i didnt like as much about it like some of the songs in the original that  werent in the factory witch wasnt that big of a deal but some things i loved were getting to see willy wonkas  back story and the fact that even successful people can even have problems also i loved some of the things they added like the puppet show at the begging of the tour of the factory also i think    jhonney depp plays an exceptional willy wonka but the effects were just amaseing in just about every way i think that the original and the remake are equally good because there were things that one movie has that the other didnt and some things that neather movie had so equally grate movies i reccomend them both
Mar 1 2012,positive,great adaptation is it safe to say i liked it more than the gene wilder version which i am also a big fan of
Mar 1 2012,positive,johnny depp though a great actor put me off on this one i felt that gene wilder did a much better job in his film
Mar 1 2012,positive,i personally liked this one better to me it answered more things and was abit more on the funny side probably because of johnny p
Feb 29 2012,positive,very strange would not recommend it for children too much dark humor
Feb 29 2012,negative,before i tell how bad this movie is i have to get this off my chest why the hell would you choose johny depp someone who usually plays dark roles for charlie and the chocolate factory hes probably the worst person for this role but with that being said the movie does not even come close to comparing to the original it was just a bad movie i thought
Feb 28 2012,positive,scared meliked the midget man though
Feb 28 2012,positive,smilex the toothpaste company mr bucket works in is the grocery store poison in batman awesome move burton
Feb 28 2012,positive,not as good as the original
Feb 28 2012,negative,ugh in someways stayed truer to book however not enough charlielets see it suceeded in maken me have seizure pretty quickly so only saw maybe one third then woke up at ending seen i think the message sticks better when dont see them leave factory and that weirdness of wonka going to charlies house screams pedo to me
Feb 28 2012,positive,johnny depp again  love it though gene wilder will always be classic
Feb 27 2012,neutral,i liked the first one better
Feb 27 2012,positive,depps freaky as ever
Feb 27 2012,positive,i think some of the casting was weird but all around it was great deep roy was amazing as the oompa loompas also danny elfmans music never fails to amaze and yet again another great burtondepp film
Feb 27 2012,positive,the original contains more warmth and charm but burtons makeover of dahls classic story is visually sumptuous and features an array of well rounded and oddball performances particularly from depp who is no gene wilder but enormously fun all the same the songs are not quite as good but not bad nontheless a good remake
Feb 26 2012,positive,johnny depp is still cool
Feb 25 2012,negative,never really a fan of original either
Feb 25 2012,positive,neogothic fantasist tim burton and writer john august big fish play it strictly by the book for this darker but far more faithful adaptation of roald dahls cautionary 1964 youngadult novel and who can forget the willy wonkas welcome songs
Feb 25 2012,positive,still like the first one best
Feb 25 2012,positive,good morning starshine the earth say hellolol
Feb 25 2012,positive,like the old movie better then the new one
Feb 24 2012,positive,the original was better but i love johnny depp
Feb 24 2012,positive,not as good as the original but i like johnny depp
Feb 24 2012,positive,never liked the original so i guess im not a true fan but i found this movie to be very fun johnny depp was good as always
Feb 24 2012,positive,the movie was almost exactly the same as the first which makes it clear how great gene wylder was in this role  johnny depp was a joke  it was a cool remake overall but the lead role prevented it from being great
Feb 23 2012,neutral,not as good as the first
Feb 22 2012,positive,faithfully captures roald dahls magic thankfully foregoing the mawkish sentimentality of willy wonka and the chocolate factory
Feb 22 2012,positive,it was good but it was bad it was silly a lot of places and the original is the best with gene wilder this one was just silly and gave it a twist in some parts overall though it was okay and a go but not a must go i reccommend it to anyone
Feb 22 2012,positive,heh lol producers on amphetemines
Feb 21 2012,positive,in my opinion this film needed more magic and less confusing ideas musicals yet is still an entertaining film and a better version of willy wonka also it has depp so thats a guarantee
Feb 21 2012,positive,the new one kinda stinks
Feb 21 2012,positive,there were a few spots in here that made me laugh literally out loud darker than the original but funnier because of that
Feb 21 2012,positive,great movie alot darker than the original but still enjoy the original more
Feb 21 2012,positive,i love johnny depp in this movie hes crazy
Feb 19 2012,positive,dude its johnny deppits all good
Feb 18 2012,positive,so much better than the original johnny depp will just never stop amazing me
Feb 18 2012,positive,i love tim burtons style but nothing beats the 1971 version
Feb 17 2012,positive,better than the original
Feb 17 2012,negative,while this movies visually appealing and has been updated to a newer century its not nearly as memorable as willy wonka  the chocolate factory also johnny depp is a horrible willy wonka as he tries to act whimsical and just comes off as annoying
Feb 17 2012,negative,garbage almost ruins the original for me
Feb 16 2012,positive,besides the fact that johney depp is creepy in this movie it was good
Feb 16 2012,negative,terrible sucks out all the wonder of roald dahls original story and uses special effects and potty humor as a way of sucking in children to watching this this movie is visually appealing ill give it that but that doesnt make up for its overall badness
Feb 15 2012,negative,a sad remake of a wonderful movie
Feb 15 2012,positive,falls a good bit short of the mark especially when stacked up next to the gene wilder original whereas the original had an interesting group dynamic going amongst all the kids and parents and willy wonka himself this 2005 version just remains awkward throughout without much heart or energy to balance it out its definitely not all bad by any means as there are some great sets and zany burtonesque atmosphere alongside some charming performances from the bucket family and pretty much from only them as far as im concerned overall id recommend seeing it if you have the curiosity sparked from the getgo otherwise its just kind of a meh from me
Feb 15 2012,negative,the remake doesnt hold a candle to the original
Feb 15 2012,positive,creepy but good the new ompa songs are aweeeesome
Feb 15 2012,positive,fun movie a little dark at times but its tim burton what would you expect
Feb 15 2012,positive,definitely a tim burton movie this film takes a closer look at the relationship to wonkas father giving depps character more of a motive than the gene wilder movie although i must say gene wilder is still a great man
Feb 15 2012,positive,i loved this one  johnny depp rocks
Feb 14 2012,positive,i went into this film expecting to hate it because of my distaste for the original but by the time it was over i didnt want it to end  the music was delightful the songs eased the pain delivered by the atrocious classic numbers the visuals were beautiful and burton spared no expense to capture the light and dark elements of the book  so to anyone out there who thinks that burton just made a gothic emo version of a classic musical and johnny depp was just goofing around instead of playing it straight im going to say this once and for all read the bloody book
Feb 14 2012,positive,my man johnnys in it and this movies really cute
Feb 14 2012,positive,honestly it was hard for me to separate this film from the gene wilder version and i felt like johnny depp was doing a weird parody of michael jackson however the story of willy wonka is certainly one of the more timeless and creative ones
Feb 13 2012,positive,willy wonka had a bit too much of the michael jacksonclown look going on for me but otherwise tim burtons touches on this modern day update on a classic are well done
Feb 13 2012,neutral,first one was better
Feb 12 2012,positive,not as good as the original but great indepth character study of willy wonka himself in this remake that of course was something that was not done in the first film the chocolate factory was more colorful and the characters especially the kids seemed more bratty than the original very dark and not as comedic but tim burton and johnny depp did wonderful solid work by freddie highmore although this would not be considered a career highlight for him same goes for burton and depp despite their great efforts as much as i love helena bonham carter i think she was out of her element playing someone who wasnt psycho or had other inner issues solid film but did not have the same impact as the original
Feb 12 2012,negative,meh  it seems like it was weird for the sakes of being weird without a whole lot to redeem it  depth was lacking where it was needed and depth was added in areas that could have been left alone  i did read the book btw a long time ago  the whole charlies dad angle could have been left out
Feb 12 2012,neutral,the only memory i have for this movie was just we have this dub thing for the movie in front of my school and we did an amazing job so many years past i still remember those lines
Feb 12 2012,negative,if i could give it less than half a star i would fuck this movie its a horrible remake original was the best
Feb 12 2012,negative,original was much better
Feb 11 2012,positive,oompa loompas all the way
Feb 10 2012,positive,i prefer this ending to the storys original
Feb 9 2012,positive,intensely underrated adaptation of the dahl classic bests the 1971 take on the same material in almost all ways though gene wilders vaguely hysterical willy wonka will always occupy a special place in the pantheon of screen lunatics
Feb 9 2012,negative,terrible and unsettling remake of an otherwise flawless original
Feb 9 2012,positive,its one of the most unjustifiably maligned films and the best reason that i can figure for the condemnation is nostalgic sentiment as well as the detractors that any film no matter how good has  clearly its the victim of harsh comparisons to the original mel stuart adaptation but the only one that seem justifiable is the gene wilder vs johnny depp argument  i think depps creepy manchildthing makes more sense than the more benign wilder his performance is another charismatic oddball familiar to depps colorful repertoire  however wilders had a wonderfully devilish sense of wry humor and an overall better design  for me though thats where the negative comparisons to the 1971 end  freddie highmore fits the ordinary boy role whos ordinary earnestness results in serendipitous fortune while peter ostrum in comparison was irritating bordering on a variation of hammy cuteness  david kellys nebbish interpretation of grandpa joe is also so very preferable to the robust and frankly unlikable jack albertson performance as well  the characters are better developed the emotions are better represented and the humor is still present but with a pleasantly psychotic edge  maybe it isnt a great movie but it sure is a very good movie which although it maybe an unpopular opinion despite the fresh rating is much better than what i can say for the original which may be funny and memorable but is dragged down by a couple of very annoying main characters that ought to be sympathetic
Feb 9 2012,neutral,a moderately satisfying film that unfortunately falls short of the potential it could have achieved thats also why i say the 1971 version is the superior one at least their changes to the story didnt involve frequent timeconsuming flashbacks
Feb 9 2012,negative,this by far is the worst movie ive have ever seen omg it was bad they fucked the story line up and they made wonka into a fag please god save your time and never watch this movie again i reather shot myself in the head then watch this movie again
Feb 9 2012,positive,awesome as and it makes me feel hungry
Feb 8 2012,positive,again the first one was better
Feb 7 2012,positive,original definitely better but i like what johnny depp brought to the role
Feb 6 2012,negative,johnny depp does not make a good willy wonka
Feb 5 2012,negative,i like the older one better
Feb 5 2012,positive,johnny depp did are really good jobtaking a role and definitely making it his own
Feb 5 2012,positive,johnny depp is a nut in this movie love it
Feb 5 2012,negative,youd definitely be better off watching the original 1971 movie than this
Feb 5 2012,positive,i really dont know what peoples problem was with this film it is much truer to the book than the other version and is much darker like roald dahls books i do really like the other one as well before you explode
Feb 4 2012,negative,tim burton said that he didnt like willy wonka and the chocolate factory because it took too many liberties with the novel he then decided to make a movie that has almost nothing to do with the style tone or story structure of roald dahls classic at all this movie is a chore to watch espcially with johnny depps uptight vocal mannerisms ruining every scene hes in
Feb 4 2012,positive,good movie johnny depp really can play any role
Feb 2 2012,positive,it was entertaining at first but it doesnt beat the 1971 classic
Feb 2 2012,positive,amazing johnny depp is the man i loved it so much however it seemed a bit more adult oriented than the original
Feb 2 2012,positive,entertaining a little kookie
Feb 2 2012,negative,while i love deep he is no wilder
Feb 1 2012,negative,not as good as the original
Feb 1 2012,negative,ok realy creapy willy wonka seams like a rapist
Jan 31 2012,positive,johnny depp is so funny in this movie
Jan 31 2012,positive,johnny depp is the most versatile actor ever
Jan 31 2012,positive,the visual goods are there to please the eyes but compared to the classic original its terrible
Jan 30 2012,negative,excuse me what the hell is this stupid crap in other words this movie sucks on so many levels great cast horrible story absolutely terrible
Jan 30 2012,positive,theres just something about it
Jan 29 2012,positive,like the old one better
Jan 29 2012,negative,it is a remake that i cannot stand cause there is no creativity or great acting that bring the magic of the 1971 film to life
Jan 29 2012,neutral,johnny depp is odd but he gets 2 n a half just becuz i love potc 13i didnt much like this movie
Jan 28 2012,positive,i liked it but i think the original movie with gene wilder as willy wonka was better
Jan 28 2012,positive,not as great as the original 1970s film
Jan 28 2012,positive,not as bad as everyone says but depp sadly cant hold a candle to gene wilder a perfectly split tim burton film definitely not one of his best but not one of his worst by any stretch my only real complaint is the fact that this one is far more about wonka than it is about charlie which does bring the ride down a little but not as heavily for me as it does for a lot of others
Jan 28 2012,positive,johnny depp was not the right man for the job
Jan 28 2012,negative,i guess it was an ok film but the original will always be much better this was just a little on the creepy side
Jan 27 2012,positive,this film reads tim burton all over it not a bad attempt but unfortunately to burton cant help it to compare it with the first one now i know it aint the same story so it aint fair but the first film is such a masterpiece it just takes away the glow this film couldve had
Jan 27 2012,neutral,johnny depp doesnt compare to gene wilder
Jan 26 2012,neutral,it was weird but funny
Jan 26 2012,positive,i love both the original and this remake the same
Jan 25 2012,positive,alright charlie and the chocolate factory the remake of a film made in the 70s and actually takes the real name of the book so does the film live up to the original and the book it almost lives up to the original but it is still a good film and it does live up to the book there were some additional things in this movie added by tim burton with some lines scenes props and anything else tim burton adds in to make the film a little creepy but its still a good movie now willy wonka and the chocolate factory is the best this film does live up to the original but again it almost lives up to the original now i have to say the actors were good charlie was good danny elfman is still burtons main composer helen b c is still in any tim burton movies including johnny depp oh and count dooku makes a cameo as will wonkas father in this movie now johnny depp is the perfect actor to make willy wonka more creepy and likable it seems that whenever tim burton puts johnny depp in his movies johnny always seems to act out his role perfectly there was a lot of cgi in this movie and it was alright but what was really stunning about this movie was that actors really knew how to act out their roles this is close to being a perfect movie but it will never be better than the original my final tomatoemeter rating is 86
Jan 25 2012,neutral,not as good as the original
Jan 25 2012,positive,im not very surprised that only 52 of the people enjoyed this movie this movie is good it was good to me at least i dont know if youll like it but i thought it was a very good and inspiring movie
Jan 24 2012,positive,funny with a mix of good acting and setting
Jan 23 2012,negative,havent seen the whole thing yet
Jan 23 2012,positive,i like this movie but wouldnt want to watch it again
Jan 23 2012,positive,76    loved the original its like a sore pecker it cant be beat im 5050 with tim burton half are good the greats batman beetlejuice edward scissorhands ed wood mars attacks and the ledgend of sleepy hallow and half not the not so great planet of the apes big fish corpse bride and alice in wonderland but his remakes always suck fortunately burtons charlie and the chocalate factory falls in the middle if i had children i wouldnt want them anywhere near depps willy wonka
Jan 23 2012,positive,fun but i didnt like the new oompa loompas or their songs
Jan 23 2012,positive,nothing compared to the charm of the original and johnny depp although colourful and quirky does not have the same qualities which gave gene wilder his best performance    the new umpa loompas look digital and unconvincing  however still a great story which is closer to the original novel and some wonderful performances throughout    35 stars
Jan 22 2012,positive,johnny depp did a really good job really goofy movie
Jan 22 2012,negative,there is only one willy wonka gene wilder is amazing in the original
Jan 22 2012,positive,there needed to be different oompas not just the same guy
Jan 21 2012,negative,the first time i saw it was in spanish it burned
Jan 21 2012,positive,kind of disapointed by it reallyit wasmeh
Jan 20 2012,negative,like the original better
Jan 20 2012,positive,i love chocolate and this movie
Jan 19 2012,positive,total copy off the original with stupid twist
Jan 19 2012,negative,i dont understand critics the original was a timeless classic while this hunk of dribble was something they pulled out of a chocolate starfish none of the acting is believable the oompa loompas arent orange nor do they sing any half decent songs and most obvious willy wonka looks like a chick fayul p
Jan 19 2012,positive,so much better than the original
Jan 19 2012,neutral,not as good as i hoped
Jan 19 2012,positive,weird for the sake of being weird  gene wilder is still wonka in my eyes
Jan 18 2012,positive,great in a creepy way but doesnt come close to the original p
Jan 18 2012,positive,johnny deep was awesome in tis movie
Jan 18 2012,negative,did not like this move at all
Jan 18 2012,positive,while i prefer the original i still really enjoyed this one  especially johnny depp and the little boy that was also in finding neverland
Jan 18 2012,negative,not as gd as older one
Jan 18 2012,negative,original much much much better
Jan 17 2012,positive,the original is better  period  depp was a poor choice  so was his hair
Jan 17 2012,positive,not as good as the first one but awsome
Jan 17 2012,neutral,first one was better
Jan 17 2012,negative,this movie was queer
Jan 17 2012,positive,i know a lot of people said they felt disturbed watching this but johnny depp i felt did a good job because he always does a great job
Jan 16 2012,negative,every director except christopher nolan is going to make at least one bad movie this is tim burtons its a remake of the classic childrens film willy wonka and the chocolate factory based off the book by roald dahl tim burton likes to put focus on characters considered outcasts to society the thing is  willy wonka isnt an outcast just a secretive and mysterious man so i knew burton would find a way to screw up the character one way or another and he did by casting johnny depp i dont hate depp hes ok but hes overrated my first complaint is the potrayal of willy wonka the original with gene wilder as wonka i believe was better theres more mystery behind him and his unassuming manner is what makes him likable and funny wonka in this version though is potrayed as if he just escaped from an asylum another problem this movie has is the other characters for one thing charlie in this movie is incredibly bland the way he reads his lines just doesnt have any flow they couldve casted someone better another thing with this charlie is hes always saying a bunch of preachy lines hes like the second coming of christ seriously when he was breaking up the chocolate to share with his family i was waiting for him to say something like eat this in rememberance of me the other children i feel that their personalities were stretched out too far but thats something you have to watch the movie for to understand this version is more faithful to the book so i was impressed with that also the songs sung by the oompa loompas were really catchy and not as redundant as the ones in the original the art direction of this movie was also really neat to look at it was almost all eyecandy literally this version was also darker in tone i didnt like that especially when you try to read the book with the same darkness surrounding the environment my biggest complaint however is the added backstory to the estrangement between wonka and his father seriously that was totally unnecessaryi know tim burton is trying to be original but he hasnt had a unique idea since 1988s beetlejuice it was cool seeing christopher lee with a cameo though he played a real vampire not the sparkly vegetarian one stephenie meyer pulled from her ass making this movie couldve gone differently they couldve added a lighter tone better comedic timing and casted better actors instead we got an ok average film i guess its ok
Jan 16 2012,positive,very crazy cool movie johnny depp is the best
Jan 16 2012,positive,hello starshinethe earth says hellooooooooo
Jan 16 2012,positive,its johnny deep and tim burton the are my favorite team
Jan 16 2012,positive,twisted version but you must watch it with a wacky sense of humor
Jan 15 2012,negative,it technically follows the original book more closely but all of the magic and imagination is somehow lost in the second rendition of roald dahls novel
Jan 15 2012,positive,i have to write a paper on thisugh but its an ok movie
Jan 15 2012,positive,funny what depp does to the role but it is a werid movie not as fun as the original
Jan 15 2012,positive,the original is better
Jan 15 2012,positive,i love johnny depps view on the story a little morbid at times but good
Jan 15 2012,negative,i liked the original willy wonka and the chocolate factory better

Jan 12 2012,negative,old one wayyyyy better
Jan 11 2012,neutral,doesnt hold a candle to the amazing original and has many cringe worthy moments throughout but ends up not being completely terrible
Jan 11 2012,negative,still prefer the film with gene wilder that film just had more appeal to me
Jan 11 2012,positive,a marilyn manson inspired willy wonka could never go wrong

Jan 8 2012,negative,the original was way better
Jan 8 2012,neutral,johnny depp is always a pleasure to watch but this movie felt flat an uncomfortable not horrible but not good
Jan 8 2012,positive,another typical burtondepp flick johnny was interesting but not enough
Jan 8 2012,positive,in no way an improvement on the gene wilder one 5 stars
Jan 8 2012,positive,a less creepy and more entertaining for me at least movie this is a fun and updated version of the movie one i enjoyed way more than the original
Jan 8 2012,positive,i like the first one more that this one
Jan 8 2012,positive,almost as good as the original  interesting

Jan 7 2012,positive,a good rendition but nothing
Jan 7 2012,positive,makes me want to go get a candy bar
Jan 7 2012,positive,its good but the gene wilder one is better
Jan 7 2012,positive,one or two good parts
Jan 7 2012,negative,raised on the original
Jan 7 2012,positive,hilarious though johnny depp was kinda scary lokin oo
Jan 7 2012,positive,couldnt really beat the old one  but it had really good graphics in it
Jan 7 2012,neutral,this just seems like a forched attempt to make this film cleaner then the original but in cleaning it you lose some of it charms
Jan 7 2012,positive,the veruca salt song is so damn catchy
Jan 6 2012,negative,the original was better
Jan 6 2012,positive,umokay  i still have nightmares about the original willy wonka and the chocolate factory   i find gene wilders wonka to be one of the creepiest characters on film  he scares me like the grinch scares my daugther  so i didnt need a remake  the new film is as twisted as youd expect from burton  for me this new film is actually less creepy even though it contains burtons warped world view and a johnny depp performance that channels michael jackson  amusingly odd and brightly colorful but not necessarily necessary
Jan 6 2012,negative,original much better love kids movies where chickens get their heads cut off
Jan 6 2012,positive,i didnt really enjoy it but it had some good moments and pretty colors
Jan 6 2012,negative,creepy movie only charlie is cute he saves it a little for me

Jan 4 2012,positive,it isnt often that i rate a newer version higher than the original but the reason for this is johnny depps absolutely amazing performance as willy wonka and whoever wrote this script was a genius nothing but belly laughs all the way through a really great adaptation of one of my favourite novels

Dec 28 2011,positive,this one is so much better then willy wonka and the chocolate factory
Dec 28 2011,negative,cant beat the original
Dec 28 2011,positive,a far more faithful adaptation than the original free of the needless filler songs and no pointlessly shoehorned in subplot on the contrary johnny depp demonstrates perfectly the effects living the way willie does can truly have on a man and the added backstory makes it all the more clear kudos also go out to deep roy for probably doing more in this film alone than some actors do in 10 true eye candy abounds in this highly colorful and atmospheric piece of work
Dec 27 2011,positive,good reimagining of willy wonkas factory
Dec 27 2011,negative,first was better  but johnny depp is funny

Dec 25 2011,neutral,original was so much better
Dec 24 2011,neutral,a respectable effort that is visually interesting as per tim burtons supreme stylization but the fact remains the original is superior in every right way gene wilders performance is immortal and johnny depp turns wonka into a baffoon and all around creepy guy

Dec 20 2011,negative,willy wonka was so much better
Dec 19 2011,positive,a strange and fun adaptation of the classic novel if you enjoy tim burton and johnny depps quirky collaborations youll find enjoyment here it adds more story elements than the book had but it works for the movie i think its a very nice looking movie that captures the spirit of the book while also putting a new spin on it
Dec 19 2011,neutral,the film deserves praise for being closer and more faithful to the classic childrens novel but its too dark for its own good considering the audience its aiming at and its just plain creepy and this ruins its chance at being something magical
Dec 18 2011,positive,not as good as the original

Dec 12 2011,negative,eww ruined the moviestick to the original
Dec 10 2011,positive,i prefer the original
Dec 10 2011,negative,tim burton is one of the imaginative and creative directories of our time but what he does not excel in at all is remakes planet of the apes was a disaster and this attempt to to recreate charlie and the chocolate factory is not too far behind it depps interpretation of wonka is more bizarre and off putting and nowhere matches the charm of wilders original the songs are much worse and the there the burtonesque touches just do not work for this type of film fans of the book will also find that this movie also takes a bit more liberties so only i believe the only ones who will enjoy this movie are huge fans of tim burton who have not read the book or seen the original film
Dec 10 2011,negative,the original was so much better
Dec 9 2011,positive,this movie was ok    not as good as the original

Dec 6 2011,positive,could have been better
Dec 4 2011,positive,amazing and johnny depp is in it
Dec 4 2011,negative,too strange seems to try too hard to make it somewhat funny with raw talent from the kids it makes it even more annoying to me i say it ruins the classic for me we needed someone like wilder in this one depp tries his best on being him but is still way off
Dec 4 2011,positive,its fun to watch this and the gene wilder version  both great tellings  and the oompa loompas in this one freak me out
Dec 3 2011,negative,why remake a movie when the original is timeless and perfect as it is
Dec 3 2011,negative,effects are cool the sets are creative the lighting is pretty good  terrible acting the story is a joke and johnny depp im a fan of johnny depp but this is one of his worst performances

Dec 1 2011,positive,johnny depp is fantastic as always
Nov 30 2011,positive,this movie is great when it comes to the story roald daul would be proud for this adaptationburton gives it the right mix of style that hit a good spot with me depp was good however he still cant match gene wilder and the kid actors for the most part are pretty good some better then others but still good what makes the movie however is wonkas backstory and the ending which i find better than the ending for even the original
Nov 30 2011,negative,completely ruined the purity and innocence of the first movie remakes should be just that remakes not redos
Nov 29 2011,positive,an old tale retold and remastered

Nov 26 2011,neutral,can u say kind of creepy
Nov 25 2011,neutral,a decent movie off a book
Nov 25 2011,negative,i was excited to see this then i saw it i was more annoyed by it than anything else the music parts were decent but then they just ended like the writers used up their budget and abruptly finished the song then instead of increasing their budget they put the rest of the money to graphically reproducingediting the same one person over and over for the oompa loompas the original was so much better id rather give this a 12 star but thats not possible
Nov 25 2011,positive,not as good as the old one
Nov 25 2011,positive,good movie about chocolate factory and it was really cool to actually see that in the end the factory belonged to a little boy instead of any other rich people

Nov 24 2011,positive,this movie was just lovley3 i love johnny depp
Nov 24 2011,positive,again liked the original better
Nov 24 2011,positive,a far more faithful adaptation of the story than the original movie tim burtons charlie and the chocolate factory is a strange wonderfully endearing film fans of the 1971 movie may not enjoy it as much but then again the majority of them havent read the book
Nov 23 2011,positive,oh the many faces of johnny depp
Nov 22 2011,negative,creepy its like the book but my god tim burton has gone off the depp end    pun intended
Nov 22 2011,positive,better than original
Nov 22 2011,positive,my favorite movie from when i was a kid
Nov 21 2011,neutral,the original again way better
Nov 20 2011,positive,more of depp but this time it was bc he was so wierd
Nov 20 2011,positive,liked the first one more
Nov 20 2011,positive,funny great and heartwarming
Nov 19 2011,positive,though the only two reasons i remember tim burton are for trying to resuscitate batman after the poor black guy underwent the joel schumacher treatment and nearly succeeding and for having the audacity to call mars attacks a movie this director gives me another reason to do with charlie and the chocolate factory while it isnt an exceptional movie it will always remain close to my heart for nearly just like he nearly succeeded in bringing batman back to life doing justice in bringing one of my all time favourite childhood stories from paper to reel     if you havent read the book by roald dahl i encourage you to do so unless you want to be born in your next lifetime as a tapeworm in a gastritic digestive tract anyway ill save you the effort charlie bucket freddie highmore is an innocent familyfirst ideally raised really poor kid living in a really poor family with his really poor father noah taylor mother helena bonham carter and his maternal and paternal grandparents all of whom love chocolate they live close to a chocolate factory owned by the elusive and eccentric mr willy wonka johnny depp who makes the best candies and chocolates in the world  forget your mars bars  were talking about nonmelting ice cream chocolate castles giant bubble blowing gum and everlasting gobstoppers among a plethora of other things that will make your salivary glands have a seizure mr wonkas eccentricity crosses the line when he declares that he has concealed five golden tickets within five of wonkas chocolate bars those five lucky recepients will be given a tour of mr wonkas factory who gates have remained closed since a mass espionage operation nearly jeopardised his secrets and sent home with a lifelasting supply of chocolates and while the world goes crazy finally lady luck smiles on charlie     whats so exceptional about this nothing of course but the childhood memories attached to this story the idea of fulfilling your wildest chocolate fantasies the way in which mr dahl lets his imagination fly like a whirlwind and the endearing characters are things that make the film so special it is the kind of film that fills your insides with an inexplicable warmth and that is what i love it for     not love actually i would say like because parts of it which ill deal will later are absolutely detestable however here are some good things all the characters know what their purpose on the set is and accomplish it well depp as wonka reminds you slightly of michael jackson and his oddball idiosyncrasies which merely adds to his to mysterious persona his behaviour also makes it obvious that it is a facade a mask to conceal some deeprooted emotions within him after descending from the pedestal of a pirate johhny depp takes this role on with ease and blends well with his character the kids too know what their role is especially young freddie highmore as the protagonist theres no way you cannot love that kid and call yourself human     the story though spellbinding originally has been toyed with in the film considering that it is primarily meant to be a childrens movie it seems like an appropriate thing to do it adds another dimension to the awkward behaviour of mr willy wonka and even tries to justify it from being a mere entertainer as in the book it also comes printed with a message for the kids chocolates are good be kind be good follow your heart dentists are evil that kind of a thing yknow     the film managed to horrify me more than most horror movies have done in the past decade and that is with the oompa loompas the thing is deep roy completely screws the oompa loompas up its like a brown elf had a rompy night with a giant beetle and out popped the oompa loompas far from being adorable they strike a nightmarish balance between creepy and disgusting all of them look the same the females included which makes it all the more worse    tim burton deserves no extra credit for his directorial efforts of which we see very little it plays out just as you would expect it to play out with mr burton making very little attempts to make it more entertaining more creative or more of anything for that matter its merely roald dahl and his storytelling abilities that make the movie worth a watch     though i just cannot forgive the movie for the oompadisaster if you can ignore that one bit you may as well end up enjoying it with nothing much in terms of intellect or intrigue to offer charlie and the chocolate factory knows that it is a childrens movie and sticks to it as swear words are muted out moral values are exemplified and everyone is left happy and content in the end
Nov 19 2011,positive,well besides the odd oompa loompas i still think the first version is better it was alright
Nov 19 2011,positive,liked the origanal better
Nov 19 2011,positive,no real point to the film it just reprises the old film and adds nothing particularly new burtons set is stylish but doesnt have the charm of the first film depp is a bit too perverse even for wonka its a fine film if you havent seen the original but was hoping for something more
Nov 18 2011,negative,i absolutely hated it why not watch the original it is creepy for young ages
Nov 17 2011,positive,it was ok to watch as a child that is simply its not for grown menwomen

Nov 12 2011,positive,i love this movie great acting
Nov 12 2011,positive,the remake of the original willy wonka did a average job at recreating the first film with nice effects and visuals the factory had more of a futuristic feel i enjoyed johnny depps character with his enthusiastic personality the rest of the cast isnt nearly as good as the first as they are boring and dull as well as the odd oompa loompa most kids will enjoy but parents today will be scratching their heads

Nov 8 2011,negative,why remake a classic
Nov 5 2011,negative,not as good as the first one
Nov 4 2011,positive,the first ones waaay better but its still good
Nov 4 2011,positive,no one can match good old johnny boy
Nov 3 2011,positive,im giving it a 55 because not only did i love the movie but im entitled to my opinion classic fanboys cry me a river
Nov 3 2011,positive,burton is as artistic as ever but depps performance is not as iconic as his previous works any actor could have done the same thing or perhaps even better
Nov 2 2011,positive,much better than the original in my opinion depp fits the part better than wilder ever could have hoped to and tim burton well need i say more
Nov 2 2011,positive,johnny depp is sooo cool would watch him blowdry his sair
Nov 2 2011,positive,could use some improvement but good overall
Nov 2 2011,negative,it was just weird  see what happens when you throw good money at a hohum script
Oct 30 2011,neutral,well made visuals and creative setscostumes storyline did not live up to dahl
Oct 30 2011,positive,such a beautiful film and an even more excellent message four out of five stars
Oct 30 2011,positive,not as good as original but it grows on you over time
Oct 29 2011,negative,stupid but good at some parts
Oct 28 2011,positive,tim burton is a great director there is no question i just dont like his style sometimes
Oct 27 2011,positive,johnny depp was just really creepy in this
Oct 27 2011,positive,probably not one of johnny depps best movies but its still harmless and funny at times the musical numbers are a bit cheesy the visuals are pretty great though still not as great as the original and one of johnnys weaker films 67
Oct 27 2011,positive,funnyand little crazy
Oct 27 2011,positive,great take on a old story
Oct 26 2011,positive,better than the gene wilder version
Oct 25 2011,negative,the original is so much better i do not like johnny depps willy wonka gene wilder had a brilliant madness about him i just do not like the changes they made to this new installment nothing was up to par for me
Oct 25 2011,neutral,i love you tim burton but it just doesnt the magic and charm of the original
Oct 25 2011,negative,the place of my childhood dreams from the original was tarnished by tim burtons unusually stale vision and direction
Oct 25 2011,positive,this does not come close to the original movie but it still manages to entertain with the quirky imagery and humor
Oct 24 2011,negative,orignal was far superior
Oct 24 2011,neutral,like the original better johnny depp is so creepy
Oct 24 2011,neutral,not as good as the original film
Oct 23 2011,negative,this movie was simply strange and painful to sit through
Oct 23 2011,positive,i saw this movie for the first time tonight it was truer to the book with some added parts that improved the story i highly recommend it
Oct 23 2011,positive,yet again johnny depp proves he can do just about anything and tim burtons gothic edge to the roald dahl classic makes this film more interesting and less tedious than the original
Oct 22 2011,positive,on its own merits charlie and the chocolate factory is a pretty good adaptation of the books  tim burton does a nice job directing the acting is solid and the movie looks nice and polished  however when compared to the original movie it doesnt hold up at all mostly because the music isnt as memorable
Oct 22 2011,positive,i have only seen the original a handful of times and ive never read the book none the less i prefer this film to the original maybe its because of my generation or because im partial to tim burton but i like the darker and more mischievous side that this film has compared to the original i also like depps wacky version of wonka making him a little zanier and harder to figure finally i like the added dimension of family to this film primarily in wonkas confusion of it
Oct 22 2011,negative,in what ways is this remake different from the original film well it stars johnny depp doing an impersonation of michael jackson and making wonka thoroughly unlikeable
Oct 22 2011,negative,not really my cup of tea
Oct 22 2011,positive,it feels a little looser than the original but its good tim burton gives a nice touch along with johnny depp
Oct 22 2011,positive,johnny depps wonka is so strange and yet i cant help but want to be his best friend i loved david kelly as grandpa joe and it was nice to see mr lee as wonkas father i cant express how much i adore the oompa loompa songs sang by danny elfman oh god danny elfman theres lots of great style here courtesy of tim burton i still dont understand all the bad words said against him yes johnny depp is in several of his movies but a lot of other directors do the same thing so whats the point i guess people just like to pick on him because he has a certain style but thats why hes described as an auteur anyway this isnt meant to be a rant but i always liked this and i used to quote it a lot all the acting is pretty good but i still dont understand why its in britain and theyre using dollars
Oct 21 2011,negative,old one is way better
Oct 21 2011,negative,johnny depp is scary 
Oct 20 2011,positive,better than the original imo
Oct 20 2011,positive,more faithful to the book and nearly wordforword but johnny depps portrayal of willy wonka is what really kills this flick
Oct 20 2011,positive,love the original hate the new one sorry mr depp
Oct 20 2011,positive,full of weird imagination but that makes this film very enjoyable
Oct 18 2011,negative,soooo not the original and soooooooo not good
Oct 17 2011,positive,scary as all get out
Oct 16 2011,positive,while many prefer the old willy wonka i find myself caught up in the splendor of jonny depps wonka and burtons vision
Oct 16 2011,positive,though i dont enjoy this adaptation of roald dahls novel of the same name as much as the 1971 classic i respect its goal to follow the source material more faithfully and differentiate itself from the other adaptation as much as possible great art direction and some catchy songs make this movie sufficiently entertaining though depps performance as willy wonka is overly creepy and unpleasant made worse by the films focus on his character    respectable in being a remake thats not unnecessary this film is kept from greatness by the forgettable characterization of charlie and depps dreadful performance which in no way comes close to comparing to that of gene wilders masterful interpretation of the character
Oct 15 2011,positive,beautiful but overimagined
Oct 15 2011,positive,i really like it but for me it seems the first one was a bit more magical
Oct 14 2011,positive,not too bad but not the original
Oct 13 2011,positive,i liked the very first one that came out 
Oct 13 2011,negative,visually thrilling but lacks the soul and magic of willy wonka and the chocolate factory
Oct 12 2011,positive,not quite five not even jd could get it there
Oct 12 2011,negative,what were they thinking the burtondepp match up is getting stale

Oct 12 2011,positive,the original is better but this is good
Oct 11 2011,positive,a little bit more like it was orginally written and visually a treat for your eyes
Oct 10 2011,positive,like the original better
Oct 10 2011,positive,i love this version better than the original just because i love johnny depp haha 
Oct 8 2011,positive,funny strong and with a very talented cast tim burton could mix his dark surrealist world into this magic dahls classic
Oct 8 2011,negative,good director and  gifted actor  a very good combination
Oct 7 2011,positive,in this remake of a childhood favorite johnny depp brings his eccentric talent to this classic vibrant narrative
Oct 7 2011,positive,slightly better than the original in my opinion with the same warm moral feelings and somewhat superior acting due to its budget and slicker appearance
Oct 6 2011,neutral,those who think this is as good as or better than the original they should slap the stupid out of them
Oct 6 2011,positive,so we traded gene wilder for michael jackson  depp made the lead creepyand not in a good way
Oct 6 2011,positive,its quite a bit different from the original one this doesnt mean its not as good just different
Oct 6 2011,positive,coooldude it is nice
Oct 5 2011,positive,sweeny todd with johnny depp was better
Oct 5 2011,positive,this film is much more faithful to the original novel that the original classic this film is packed with humor and stunning visual effects this film stands on its own as a brilliant movie johnny depp show in this film that he is one of the greatest actors who ever lived with his role as willy wonka the only shortcoming of this film is the addition of tim burton regular christopher lee as willy wonkas father tim butons style fit this movie perfectly making this one of my favorite movies of all time
Oct 4 2011,positive,this was a pretty good remake
Oct 4 2011,positive,burtons quirky style works well here he should make more family films
Oct 4 2011,negative,not crazy about this one
Oct 3 2011,neutral,johnny depp was not meant for this role the kid pulled charlie off perfectly probably even better than the last kid it lacks a certain charm of the originals oldschool vibe now if david tennet who plays the 10th doctor had been will wonka this movie just might have been better
Oct 2 2011,positive,tim burton always takes risks and he took another one here to challenge the classic first willy wonka film he tackled it and did a very good job in my opinion he kept it original but added his own twist and flavor to it
Oct 2 2011,positive,ultimately cool as a kid
Oct 1 2011,positive,watch them every year
Oct 1 2011,positive,i was not disappointed by this remake  it was darker than the first version which was the perfect role for johnny depp
Sep 30 2011,positive,oh willy wonka what an amazing character you were to be played by the incredible johnny depp   a performance thats worth a big round of applause for a tremendous picture with lots and lots of colors music chocolate candy and excitement that are all beautifully mixed up together making you wish to be a part of it all in your own live version of the chocolate factory
Sep 29 2011,positive,i liked it at the time
Sep 27 2011,negative,johnny depp does creepy well but i loved the original with gene wilder better
Sep 27 2011,positive,cool crush johnny depp
Sep 26 2011,negative,butchered a classic movie
Sep 26 2011,negative,is this movie about willy wonka or michael jackson
Sep 25 2011,positive,depps efforts are commendable  hes always bringing something new to a movie makes you wonder how many he has left in him movies take their toll as shared with mr depp by hollywood heavyweight marlon brando    personally i still give the nod to the original which i saw when i was ten you have to love the fact that gene wilder took the role for willy wonka on the sole condition that he be allowed to do a somersault on his grand entrance    a roll for the role
Sep 24 2011,negative,liked the first one way better
Sep 22 2011,positive,mmm candydid not care for acting just the candy lol
Sep 22 2011,positive,johnny depp was bomb in this movie
Sep 21 2011,negative,i have no desire to watch this movie again its weird the older one is 10 times better
Sep 20 2011,positive,not as good as the original
Sep 19 2011,positive,the one with jd is the best
Sep 19 2011,negative,this movie is really gross and i dont like it this crap needs to explode and go away forever cause its so bad i hate this dumb version stupid tim burton and johnny depp killed a perfectly fine classic movie
Sep 19 2011,negative,i didnt like it as much as the orignal
Sep 17 2011,positive,a succulent extravaganza the chocolate factory is a vibrant and colorful spectacle but also mysterious and dark eccentric and certainly delightful this film is centered around a few types of children and their guardians and criticizes the spoiling of youngsters anyone though can find escape and entertainment in this title enjoying the sights the fine music and johnny depps unique performance of the lord of sweets
Sep 17 2011,negative,gene wilder was much creepier the orignal was heaps darker than this this one tried to be dark and weird i love johnny reply but gene wilder is and always will be willy wonker
Sep 16 2011,neutral,some movies are so perfect that remakes should never be made i know im not judging it fairly by comparing it to the original but i cant help it
Sep 16 2011,positive,tim burtons simple straight to the point characters make this an excellent children movie but for people looking for something a little more in depth it was ok
Sep 16 2011,positive,johnny depp is phenomenal
Sep 15 2011,neutral,the best kind of a prize is a surprize hahahaha
Sep 15 2011,positive,like the original better
Sep 14 2011,positive,pretty great remake its so good i love both movies equally
Sep 13 2011,neutral,visually epic but the plot was not as great as the first
Sep 13 2011,positive,a dark and oddly made remake that shines brighter that it was meant to be johnny depp is at his oddest role of his career and somehow one of the best also without tim burtons dark imaginative mind this wouldnt have been a perfect remake charlie and the chocolate factory stands tall from the beginning and ends with happiness that can make even the grinch smile
Sep 11 2011,positive,many lamented this film annoyed that someone would remake a film many consider to be a classic  i actually like both versionsboth have their up and downs but neither is a 100 adaptation of the wonderful book  this one gets the oompa loompas perfect just as they are described in the book along with the original song lyrics from the novel as well for their songs  if they did one thing wrong in this one it was the addition of wonkas backstory  i also preferred wilder to depp as wonka  still this film had plenty of enjoyable moments not as bad an adaptation as some would claim
Sep 10 2011,positive,i have this movie and i think its really cute i really would love to be on the place where everything was edible
Sep 7 2011,negative,willy wonka and the chocolate factory was better
Sep 7 2011,positive,lets boogie    charlie and the chocolate factory was a movie i saw when it was first released i was 9 at the time so of course i loved it in fact while i was in elementary school i read the novel of the same name by roald dahl and as the rt consensus states this film is closer to that book than the original 1971 movie is for that reason i always preferred to watch this version the first thing i will say that i appreciate the title the book was titled charlie and the chocolate factory but the original film was not i never saw the logic in that while yes i have seen willy wonka and the chocolate factory i just dont understand why it would be titled as such the story is charlies journey and the title should reflect that    that being said heres my review i was starting to distance myself from tim burtons films i felt i didnt really like them all that much for whatever reason but i remember liking this one in particular so this year i decided to give tim burton a chance by going to see his latest film frankenweenie in theaters i loved it so i thought id do myself another service and rewatch the movie of his that i said i enjoyed im 17 now and i gotta say i still really love this movie    the childhood nostalgic vibe i got from watching this movie again was just unprecedented i tip my hat to tim burton he really crafted an excellent film despite what the rt audience consensus indicates whatever thats all about this movie is just filled with imagination and sweet little moments which are appropriate considering the plot revolves around candy    lets talk about the first of two central characters charlie bucket is shown to be a boy down on his luck in a poor family however his spirits are always held high and he still just appreciates being with his family above all else not a bad trait to have this immediately struck me as a great role model for children since they are guaranteed to watch this movie but also for just anyone    the other four kids on the contrary demonstrate qualities that children should not have listing them off  augustus gloop indulgent  veruca salt spoiled   violet beauregarde arrogant  mike teavee violent pretentious    this movie is great to show to children because it shows in beautiful and hilarious detail what happens when qualities like these dont get anyone anywhere and why an attitude like charlies is key it can be seen there that this movie actually has a point other than just being eye candy hehe see what i did there    but lets talk about the big guns the scenestealer johnny depp as willy wonka over the past few years hearing that johnny depp was in yet another movie by tim burton would eventually just sound cheesy but i gotta tell you depp is a great actor and it goes to show here i swear his performance here compared to his portrayal of jack sparrow in pirates of the caribbean and i wouldve thought it was two different people this guy has some serious range the reason i say hes so great is because hes just flat out hilarious he hits and nails every single possible moment for comedic effect bringing the movie to a broader audience and one not exclusively for children and whats even greater about that is the other characters reactions to him they always have the look on their face like wtf only adding to the hilarity    aside from comedic relief the character of wonka is interesting in this film because there is a subplot detailing how this guy became who he is some may call it unnecessary but i think it is appropriate and makes sense why a guy would act ridiculous and isolate himself from the world the story is allaround a great visual feast and an entertaining fun time for children but also a funny and maybe even relatable time for the older crowd charlie and the chocolate factory at least for me has not lost any of its shine despite my inevitable maturation strong 5 out of 5
Sep 7 2011,negative,definitely subpar remake of classic willy wonka and the chocolate factory no reason for this to be made
Sep 7 2011,positive,tim burtons remake was certainly welldone and johnny depp played and excellent willy wonka
Sep 6 2011,positive,depp is dented in this one but very interesting

Aug 28 2011,negative,the visuals are great and the kids are great actors however wonka is creepy and freaky and the oompa loompas songs are annoying and forgettable
Aug 27 2011,positive,passably good i was pleased
Aug 27 2011,positive,although it may be deeper and stranger that the original charlie and the chocolate factory just doesnt compare to it
Aug 27 2011,positive,im still sticking with the 71 original as my favorite  the 2005 remake is yet indeed entertaining  closer to the book but it didnt have that fun family feel to it  it didnt make me want to watch it every time i wanted to feel happy coming from burton its very well done visually  acting to me it just didnt have that classic feel to it its darker not as dark as burton can be for me it just passed the line between rotten  fresh
Aug 26 2011,positive,good movie still like the old one better but johnny depp as wonka was great love all the visuals in this movie
Aug 26 2011,negative,this movie is screwed up in so many ways i cant explain sorry burton this doesnt pass
Aug 24 2011,neutral,better in some ways than the original but not in the ways that count
Aug 24 2011,positive,edited    director tim burton brings his unique vision and sensibility to roald dahls classic childrens story in this lavish screen interpretation willy wonka johnny depp is the secretive and wildly imaginative man behind the worlds most celebrated candy company and while the wonka factory is famously closed to visitors the reclusive candy man decides to give five lucky children a chance to see the inside of his operation by placing golden tickets in five randomly selected chocolate bars charlie bucket freddie highmore whose poor but loving family lives literally in the shadow of the wonka factory is lucky enough to obtain one of the tickets and charlie escorted by his grandpa joe david kelly is in for the ride of a lifetime as he tours the strange and remarkable world of wonka with fellow winners mediaobsessed mike teavee jordan fry harsh and greedy veruca salt julia winter gluttonous augustus gloop philip wiegratz and ultracompetitive violet beauregarde annasophia robb over the course of the day some of the children will learn difficult lessons about themselves and one will go on to become wonkas new right hand charlie and the chocolate factory also stars christopher lee james fox and noah taylor the book was famously adapted to the screen before in 1971 under the title willy wonka and the chocolate factory with gene wilder as the eccentric candy tycoon     starring johnny depp freddie highmore david kelly helena bonham carter noah taylor  missi pyle  james fox  deep roy  christopher lee  adam godley  franziska troegner  annasophia robb  julia winter  jordan fry  philip wiegratz  blair dunlop  annette badland    directed by the wonderful tim burton i dont need to list down his movies since they are so many and you already know him    nominated for 1 oscar best costume design    i seriously dont remember how many times i have seen this movie i have no idea why people dont like it so much people literally have negative things about this movie but i really like it i am quite satisfied with this film and what tim burton made it to be i may have complaints with some of his movies like alice in wonderland but this was really lovable good movie this may not be flawless but still good i havent seen the original movie and i have heard so many times that it is much more accurate to the book and also much more visually appealing    this is a very fun filled dark creepy weird musical fantasy adventure movie for kids and families that you will love to watch over and over again this is one of tims best i loved the special effects though much of it was original but i like some of the effects also the costumes make up was good art direction and cinematography was spectacular songs werent memorable but score was good    johnny depp as willy wonka may not be very likable to me but he was just fun i am not gonna criticize or say bad things about his performance but it wasnt impressive he looked good and did a fine job but it just was not working for me though i like to see him in these kind of parts freddie highmore was really good and lovable he gave a nice performance other children were nice too every actor did a fine job and i liked how tim showed each and every characters    plot is nice and screenplay have bit of weak points but its very visually appealing and quite adventures not very fast paced or something    story is about this child charlie bucket who is very poor and everything willy wonka who has this biggest chocolate factory arranges a visit of 5 random children who find these 5 golden tickets and will visit his factory charlies luck is very strong since he out of nowhere accidently finds one they visit this factory but the bad and disobeying children one by one faces certain consequences and the end one will receive a special prize and the story goes on    movie is funny and very silly too but that makes it so good not a classic but a good movie to watch
Aug 23 2011,negative,when i was eight and and i saw the trailer for this movie i knew it was going to suck you cant top the original  even though i love johnny depp i hated this performance i mean my god this guy is annoying johnny you can do better thanthat  another thing i hated was what the did with charlie this kid behaves like a freaking boy scout in the original charlie got upset at some points that isnt bad its realistic this charlie on the other hand is just bbbbbllllaaaannnddd  and the songs in the new versions are pretty forgettable except for one that tormented so many people including me months after seeing this movie  so stick to the original and save your sanity
Aug 23 2011,positive,ah brings back the childhood memories 
Aug 23 2011,positive,i 3 love this movieeee 
Aug 22 2011,positive,a decent if unnecessary remake burton once again delivers in the visual department but people who are attached to the original version may not enjoy this twisted darker adaptation quite as much
Aug 21 2011,negative,i have a very weird place in my heart for this film one on hand i hate it with every fiber of my being it is one of the worst films ive seen in my entire life a disgrace to the book the original film and cinema in general on the other hand i watch it a lot its a travesty but a vastly entertaining one i have to give it points for that
Aug 21 2011,positive,3 stars for johnnys presencebut the first was so much better

Aug 6 2011,positive,i like a lot of johnny depps movies
Aug 5 2011,positive,the origin story of willy wonka kind of cooled my ardor towards this film  its still visually impressive though
Aug 5 2011,positive,a remake of the original great for kids nd the whole family
Aug 3 2011,positive,i want it all those chocolate in there
Aug 3 2011,negative,the original was very goofy and silly but had heart this one tries to have heart but it just comes off as a stupid and annoying

Aug 2 2011,positive,loved it being a johnny depp fan i might like it a bit more than the original
Aug 2 2011,positive,the original was bettter depp did an excellent job though
Aug 1 2011,positive,johnny depps performance seems to be a love it or hate it thing i think that johnny depp did a great job in keeping with tim burtons darker vision for the film and differentiating himself from the 1971 movie having read the book this movie was also closer to the source and i def appreciate that i guess that some people just cant get over that its a tim burton movie so yes its going to be dark and yes johnny depp is going to be weird
Aug 1 2011,positive,the original move was better johnny depp did make this character his own
Aug 1 2011,positive,ver interesting with good messages
Jul 31 2011,negative,not as gud as the frist one
Jul 31 2011,positive,a somewhat failed attempt at a remake of one of the best films ever

Jul 27 2011,neutral,the original was way better
Jul 27 2011,negative,johnny depp was a little odd in this  movie
Jul 26 2011,negative,the tim burton version isnt great at all
Jul 25 2011,negative,there are some films that are made with such a beautiful touch with such grandiose that they should never be remade one film that fits this mold is the gene wilder classic charlie and the chocolate factory yes author of the book roald dahl publicly bashed the original film adaptation claiming that it was not the book i wrote sure it certainly strays away from the source material in some scenes but it has an overwhelming warmth to it and gene wilder gives a dazzling performance as willy wonka tim burtons adaptation on the other hand is more loyal to the text in the literal sense but it completely misses in the atmosphere category as the film feels like any other tim burton film dark creepy basically a 90s goth teens bedroom johnny depp is treacherously miscast as wonka instead of an ambiguously cynical mastermind with a good heart and a warm aura depp portrays wonka as a cynical meanspirited candy tycoon with no real positive traits to admire the children in both films save for charlie of course are wretched unforgivable little brats who make the audience cringe in disgust at their antics burtons cast of children are indeed vile but arent as effective in persuading  the audience that they are getting their just desserts both charlies are played with warmth and compassion but peter ostrums performance in the original is far more believable and superior in every way sure burton may select to remain true to the book in most cases although he does stray away in some instances but he completely misses the warmth and undeniable likeability within the main cast it turns into an awful misfire as burton adds his trademark touch to the film and it is most certainly out of place
Jul 25 2011,positive,i like the one with gene wilder better
Jul 24 2011,negative,johnny deep  tim burton have turned willy wonka into an emo faggot wonderland
Jul 24 2011,negative,update its been two years since the review i made when i was a young teen and i got to say i rewatched the charlie film and i really hate it its a good attempt but it fails haters gonna hate when i say im not a big fan of johnny depp nor tim burton both are stranger than fiction and for some reason always makestar in dark weird films i think the worst flaw of the film is johnny depps annoying capture of willy wonka its pretty much an immature child trapped in a grown mans body who always says weird things ha ha youre really weird and makes girlygaysounding giggles he also makes lame jokes from time to time that are never really that funny god is he annoying however i must say that i found the children to be better in the film i think august violet veruca and mike are all fine but i found charlie to be kinda annoying with his poor kid boo hoo routine i think the newer grandpa joe doesnt capture the fine kind old man that the previous grandpa joe was in the original  and oh shall i go on about tim burton like my other wretched reviews about his films tim burton has got to be the strangest director on the face of the planet im serious why does tim burton have to add dark in every thing he makes he even just had to put some dark in a childrens film classic so of course make a terrible remake i dunno i have a thing against burton that not many other people do if you hear me then thanks so much make less tim burton and replace him with better directors instead like robert zemeckis or somebody else  amen
Jul 24 2011,positive,johnny depp worth it
Jul 24 2011,positive,tim burtons shiny update of the roald dahl story is actually very entertaining
Jul 24 2011,negative,creepy  the old one is better
Jul 24 2011,positive,a perfect adaptation of roald dahls excellent book
Jul 23 2011,neutral,i never understood this is this a dark comedy because i think it aims for that but ends up looking like a kids movie with rather questionable motifs this movies just bizarre and not even in a psychedelic cool way
Jul 22 2011,positive,again johnny comes thru w originality
Jul 22 2011,positive,this movie does a good job of sticking to the source material and even though jonny depp is not the best willy wonka he is still good
Jul 22 2011,positive,i love the original so much more
Jul 22 2011,positive,i prefer the other movie with gene wilder

Jul 16 2011,positive,this why my favorite color is purple and green
Jul 16 2011,negative, i didnt get it one main thing i dont understand is why they remade the movie in the first place it was perfectly fine the way it was the original was fun and had a lot of depth to it this one is just so weird instead of being fun this one takes a darker approach that really doesnt work
Jul 16 2011,negative,cant agree this belongs on the list production values and musical performances aside johnny depps over the top self indulgent take on willy wonka was deeply offputting by his own admission  depp modeled the characters mannerisms on the behavior of a 16year old girl a creative choice that left him so bloated with chewed scenery that he was unable to project anything but dramatic gas while crudely executed compared to burtons version the original film interpretation outshines its successor thanks to gene wilders performance as the owner of the fabled chocolate factory that was sweet on the surface but dark under the surface
Jul 16 2011,positive,there were some parts i enjoyed but some i wished they hadnt included like that unnecessary musical number that reminded me of one from ella enchanted

Jul 11 2011,neutral,the original is superior the songs are fun and i liked seeing what happened to the bad kids but all the extra story elements are weird or boring i also johnny depp was awful as wonka
Jul 11 2011,positive,in burtons hands charlie  the chocolate factory is darker and visually splendid  though theres nothing which really makes the movie its own
Jul 11 2011,neutral,only movie i didnt like with johnny in it

Jul 8 2011,positive,crazy characters great visuals and a great score
Jul 7 2011,positive,have not seen this one only bits and pcsstill need to watch it all but the original is the best for sure
Jul 7 2011,positive,i love chocolates it made charlies hard heart soft
Jul 7 2011,positive,a movie that cant be compared to the 1971 classic but something to be watched on its own for its attacks was surely uniquely tim burtonthough i gotta say i loved this better than the original special effects aside and though gene wilder was a gem i loved the dark eccentricity depp gave wonka in this film both films are wonderful but i preferred this one more because of its witty darkness but if you prefer a real musical film then you better watch the original 
Jul 6 2011,negative,will never beat the original

Jul 5 2011,negative,wasnt really that good
Jul 4 2011,positive,very uneccessary remake
Jul 3 2011,negative,is johnny depps channeling michael jackson in his performance as willy wonka
Jul 3 2011,positive,a bit weird but what do you expect from tim burton i love the casting and i love how it stuck to both books tim burton can do no wrong in my opinion
Jul 3 2011,neutral,ok remakes make you want to see the original
Jul 2 2011,positive,not quite as good as the original but enjoyable regardless but any who say this is more faithful to its source material than the original need to be slapped as it deviates from the original story even more
Jul 2 2011,positive,meh in comparison to the first
Jul 2 2011,negative,blasphemy   i wouldnt even give it a star if i could   i love burton endlessly and depp is one of my favs but this is not a movie that should have been redone not at all
Jul 2 2011,negative,terrible just awful johnny depp you cant even scrape the shit off of gene wilders shoes
Jul 2 2011,negative,awkward  with way too many special effects distracting from the underlying story
Jul 1 2011,positive,not like the original but its funny
Jul 1 2011,positive,johnny depp makes the movie
Jun 30 2011,negative,this movie was creepy and boring  i would much rather watch the original
Jun 30 2011,positive,well i guess i cant talk about charlie and the chocolate factory without talking more about the original fans of the original version typically are disgusted at this version they ridicule it for being a terrible representation of their childhood and overall decide they dont like it that my dear friends is the effect of rose colored glasses i honestly dont care what others say i really like this version too from where im sitting this version works in ways just as good and dare i say even better in other ways then the first one this film has undeniably the better visuals along with more clever songs from the oompa loompas rather than wise words from the oompa loompa doopity doo there are more clever lyrics along with successfully tackling a decade of music by each kid 50s mambo for augustus 60s disco for violet 70s soft rock for veruca and 80s hard rock for mike teavee the kids themselves are mostly better in this version too while no one can top the hilarious veruca of old i got more into this augustus mike and anna sophia robbs violet beauregarde johnny depp admittedly is not such an iconic image of wonka that gene wilder was but it works for what they were trying to do i did much enjoy the backstory they gave him along with the plot twists to add to a very simple story to summarize it was more modern which may be why i enjoyed it really these are two different movies the first is a family musical film this one is more of a full length novel story of course the latter is credited to tim burton who really does tell good stories and like many of his others i like this one
Jun 29 2011,negative,i liked the original one better
Jun 29 2011,positive,who knew there was a river of chocolate
Jun 29 2011,neutral,tim burton had a good go never beat the 1st install
Jun 28 2011,positive,a macabre delight better than the original in my opinion
Jun 27 2011,neutral,some things dont need to be remade
Jun 27 2011,negative,serious miss sorry tim
Jun 26 2011,positive,i never understood this is this a dark comedy because i think it aims for that but ends up looking like a kids movie with rather questionable motifs this movies just bizarre and not even in a psychedelic cool way
Jun 25 2011,positive,i liked the effects but the story wasnt that good and depps performance was good but way too weird
Jun 24 2011,neutral,charile and grandpa joe are better in this and the oompa loompas sing better other then that not as good as 70s
Jun 24 2011,neutral,depends on which one the older version is a lot better than the newer one
Jun 23 2011,positive,a great adaptation with beaultifull design
Jun 23 2011,positive,a delicious family treat for everyone
Jun 23 2011,positive,awesome and funny better than the first in my opinion

Jun 22 2011,negative,why did willa wonka started the competition in the first place the  movie never established the reason  behind it
Jun 21 2011,positive,love anything with depp in it
Jun 21 2011,negative,not the best at the least
Jun 21 2011,positive,at the time this was made i only wanted to see it because tim burton directed it and he did a bloody good job of it amazin
Jun 21 2011,negative,absolutely terrible one of the worst movies ive seen
Jun 21 2011,positive,funny little movie thank goodness tim did not make his own scary tunnel who knows what we would have seen
Jun 21 2011,positive,cant beat the original
Jun 20 2011,positive,tim burton did a great job the film was beautiful and johnny depp was amazing as always but i still prefer the original  this one was a bit more faithful to the details and spirit of the book though  the updated music was quite catchy too
Jun 20 2011,positive,fans of the 1970s willy wonka will cry blasphemy fans of roald dahls novel will hopefully see that this film is better than the original in several ways first the film is much closer to the original novel in that it has an overall darker feel the drab yet visually appealing production design perfectly illustrates the darkness of dahls novel and is much more convincing than the bright colors and general lightness of the 1970s film the film has a dark creepy sort of feel which i believe is much more in line with dahls original vision for this story and really makes you curious as to what the hell is going on in that chocolate factory is it really the special sort of place its been made out to be or is there something darker looming beneath also the songs in the movie are much more original and entertaining than in the first film however the one place where the movie does falter is in its portrayal of willy wonka johnny depp gives a good performance but the script doesnt really do justice to the mysterious character present in dahls novel and to some extent in the original film though it is still a delightfully weird beautifully shot adaptation and one of tim burtons best
Jun 19 2011,negative,never should have been remade
Jun 19 2011,positive,like it movie was okay but its more for a whole family to watch or just some kids that intressted into this type of movie
Jun 18 2011,positive,was freaky and ok but not as good as the original
Jun 18 2011,neutral,didnt really like it that much
Jun 18 2011,positive,not the best tim burton movie
Jun 18 2011,negative,this film just overshoots it altogether its too much of a visual spectacle and completely loses the beauty of roald dahls story the 1971 film with gene wilder is much more effective and enjoyable
Jun 18 2011,neutral,its good when it stays true to its source and its terrible when it deviates from the book johnny depp is not wellcast for the role he plays nor is director tim burton
Jun 17 2011,positive,despite it being a more faithful adaption to the book and being a visual treat it just doesnt capture the same spirit that we know and love the original one for
Jun 17 2011,positive,haha i love the chocolatey part so yummy
Jun 16 2011,positive,faithful to the original as well as the book although the sarcastic and rude willy wonka is just not as cheerful and jolly as the original films
Jun 16 2011,positive,tim burtons masterpiece a wonderful movie that is true to the book and extremely entertaining one of my favorites
Jun 15 2011,negative,loved it as a kid not sure why
Jun 15 2011,positive,i find charlie and the chocolate factory to be a delightfully whimsical and dark adaptation of roald dahls childrens book the art direction costume design visual effects and overall tone are first rate in my opinion this is because they evoke the youthful and colorful spirit of the source material to the overall picture tim burton faithfully adapts dahls book while simultaneously adding his own touches such as references to his own motion pictures johnny depps performance as willy wonka had received mixed reactions from viewers personally i actually truly enjoy him as wonka as he shows the childish and troubled side of his character even if he goes overthetop i would argue that anyone playing wonka can get away with being overthetop because the character is overtly eccentric and colorful i also enjoy the variety of music genres mixed into the oompaloompas songs such as rock funk and bollywood the children are all wonderfully cast especially freddie highmore as the title character charlie i like how they go into depth with the story and characters but they could gone further with some overall i consider the film to be a wellproduced and visually exquisite adaptation
Jun 15 2011,negative,i did not like it all that well but it is ok
Jun 14 2011,positive,not as good as the original
Jun 14 2011,negative,ok i like the first  way better
Jun 14 2011,positive,the other one was way better
Jun 14 2011,positive,its good and funny but i liked the original way better
Jun 14 2011,positive,the sweetest part about charlie and the chocolate factory is the acting  johnny depp delivers a very very quirky performance as willy wonkawhich is good because this was how roald dahl original wrote it in his classic childrens novel so overall johnny depp is without a doubt better than gene wilder  also freddie highmore can act poor as can helena bonham carter his characters mother and he is much less obnoxious than the kid who played him in willy wonka and the chocolate factory  but as for the rest of the kids theyre all still just as much brats if not brattier    i was surprised at how scary this film was well for a family movie of course  it is sigh another burtondepp collaboration so it has those moments where they throw things in that are just plain creepy to kids but to which adults will react with an elongated ohhhkay  but i mean this is an eerier tim burton family film than even the nightmare before christmas with an overly mysterious feel    overall charlie and the chocolate factory was not bad not bad at all  its worth a good try with your familyjust make sure you have enough bags of popcorn but not enough to make you look like that one morbidly obese kid from this movieer whats his name again
Jun 13 2011,negative,it was alright i would only watch it one time
Jun 13 2011,negative,somewhat empty  so tim burton the master of remaking movies that dont need to be remade stakes his claim on another property  when you remake something or make a different version of it potateo pototo you cant help but compare it to the original and when you remake a big property like this youve got your work cut out for you and this pales to the 1971 original  its almost like burton just missed the point completely  i will start off with the good and say that it is visually interesting and danny elfmans score as it usually is is solid  however johnny depp makes for an uncomfortable willy wonka and all the fun is sucked out of his role as the only thing he really does is hijack the movie with awkward interactions with children not steal the show like gene wilder did  all of the sides of his backstory in flashback are unnecessary and slow down the movie  also the oompa loompas were sooo much cooler in the first movie  here they cgi the same guys face on every single one of them and their songs suck st through a straw they are seriously bad  every song is like that one scene in alice in wonderland where johnny depp starts breakdancing theyre just terrible and leave you with a horrified look on your face  they dont give charlie much of a personality either they instead made the other kids brattier so he looks better by comparison  the songs arent as good the movie isnt as good and all the fun whimsy you want is missing in action and were left with something hollow
Jun 12 2011,negative,i give this two stars because no one should have remade the original  but i love johnny depp
Jun 12 2011,neutral,dark and wicked even though charlie and the chocolate factory are these things it doesnt live up to the original
Jun 11 2011,positive,a magnificient piece of work
Jun 11 2011,positive,not as good as the original but still good
Jun 11 2011,positive,one f my favorite movies
Jun 11 2011,negative,not as good as the gene wilder version
Jun 11 2011,positive,though acted by johnny depp
Jun 10 2011,positive,dark funny and superbly acted
Jun 10 2011,positive,better than original
Jun 10 2011,positive,im going to have to go with average on this one  even though im a big fan of tim burton i wasnt to impressed with this version  not surprised that depp plays wonka in this but i think christopher walken would have made a better more creepy wonka
Jun 10 2011,positive,ive watched this movie for 2 times before  and would like to watch it again 
Jun 9 2011,positive,im soooo jealous of charliea mean hes livin in mansion full of candynt 2 mention chocolateso jealous
Jun 9 2011,positive,a classic u cant beat
Jun 8 2011,positive,a great ambitious film it did the best it could with an untimely book and really pulled it together well
Jun 8 2011,positive,liked it better than the original
Jun 7 2011,positive,i just didnt like the oompa loompas and their new songs
Jun 7 2011,negative,i cant believe what burton did with the oompa loompas  i was always going to respond critically to this having loved the original film and the book but that put the lid on it
Jun 6 2011,positive,charlie and the chocolate factory 910
Jun 5 2011,positive,good movie  johnny depp has brought out the creepy in the chocolate man lol
Jun 4 2011,positive,to be fair i was never a big fan of the original film adaptation of roald dahl famed childrens tale of theumlets just say lavish chocolate factory but at least this one is more in tune with the book  depps michael jacksonesque approach to the character is quite wonderful to watch but as for the movie it gives me the same problem i had with the first film  no matter how well done it is i really just dont give a bleep about any of the characters      3 stars only because of its quality
Jun 4 2011,negative,you cant beat the classic
Jun 4 2011,positive,not bad but i prefer the original
Jun 4 2011,positive,loved it then again it is johnny depp 
Jun 4 2011,positive,i had impression that johnny depp way of acting is too similar to michael jackson too oompa loompas wouldve been better if they all were different and i expected that chocolate factory would be much more magnificent but overall its a nice movie despite of many differences from the book  but i think that many movies adaptations have the same problem great acting good visuals some wonderful scenes i heartily recommend
Jun 4 2011,negative,though more true to the book of the same name than the other film charlie and the chocolate factory is more interested in making the visuals eye appealing than actually making the film fun and exciting we are instead given a creepy and obnoxious excuse of a family film
Jun 4 2011,positive,makes me want to eat chocolate
Jun 4 2011,neutral,too fictional for my taste
Jun 3 2011,negative,hated it there is something to be said about how the original version did so much with such little use of computer graphics the original had a subtlety it was whimsical and scary at the same time this version is just creepy
Jun 3 2011,positive,good but cant compare to the original
Jun 3 2011,positive,at the end of the day the highlight of this movie is the performances and the stamps created by tim burtons dark yet amusing style
Jun 3 2011,positive,i loved it  then again it is jonny depp 
Jun 3 2011,positive,not nearly as good as tim burtons other movies though its still a fun and dark movie a classic
Jun 3 2011,negative,sure it looks good but it smells like crap to my brain ill happily watch gene wilders wonka over depps anyday though i am a fan of johnny not that he did bad the love just isnt there
Jun 3 2011,positive,new twisted and funny good job tim burton
Jun 2 2011,positive,i have the golden ticket right in my very hand
Jun 1 2011,negative,a sore disappointment theres simply no love in this movie and because of it the film falls flat on its face the strangeness and lack of elevation seen in the factory scenes are far from roald dahls original intention a meanspirited work this film shows how far our society has fallen since the original classic in 1971 to consider this a good childrens film is completely unacceptable half a star
Jun 1 2011,negative,okay granted it wasnt as bad as i thought it would be it still cant hold a candle to the original 1971 movie    first of all it is not closer to the source material the original book was about charlie who is bland overlysaintlike and doesnt act like a kid at all not willy wonka who is craptastically annoying in this movie it just isnt a memorable movie    now to be fair i will give it credit where its due the special effects are pretty clever and i will also give it props for putting it in a more modern world but different isnt always good and this movie is proof of jsut that    gimme the 1971 classic any day of the week
Jun 1 2011,positive,seen it one too many times
Jun 1 2011,positive,personally i find the oompa loompas to be rather adorable especially with their songs and johnny depp portraying the quirky character of willy wonka was great to watch an entire factory of chocolate  any little kids dream right
Jun 1 2011,positive,alright honest opinion its more fun than the original i dont know which is better as i rate them the same but hey its a good film
May 31 2011,positive,i thought it was quite the improvement on the original staying much closer to the source material plus its depp and burton which means you cant go wrong
May 31 2011,positive,i love bourtons take on this story i still love the original better but tims vision always makes things stylized in a spooky tone it fits in this
May 31 2011,negative,bad tim burton bad  definitely tarnishes the name of the original willy wonka and the chocolate factory  this movie is just plain silly and not in a good or tim burton kind of way either  what the hell was hethey thinking
May 30 2011,positive,though its more visually impressive and closer to the source material than the original i cant seem to like this one more than the original even with the presence of johnny depp
May 30 2011,positive,magically entertaining the acting from johny depp is just epic hes really goddamn good in this movie
May 30 2011,positive,its not that bad
May 30 2011,negative,go watch the original
May 30 2011,negative,cant beat the original
May 29 2011,positive,i would not it possible to top the gene wilder version but hey its johnny depp  tim burton a match always made in heavengreat fun for all ages
May 29 2011,negative,how is it possible critics enjoyed this movie more than audiences i know i know its not supposed to be like the original but you cant help but compare it which leads me to say that theres absolutely no comparison
May 29 2011,negative,not as good as the original
May 29 2011,positive,while i still greatly enjoy the gene wider version depp plays a good willy wonka and this version clearly plays closer to the book
May 28 2011,positive,i liked the gene wilder version better but the film is still enjoyable
May 28 2011,positive,tim burtons version of the book is so scrumpcious and delicious that your begging for even more of this amazing family film a
May 28 2011,positive,much better than the first

May 22 2011,positive,johnny depp says the most random thingslol
May 22 2011,positive,i feel that the original better conveyed the original work by roald dahl
May 21 2011,neutral,good dark funny different  bad annoying oompa loompas people dont like to see the remake of a classic    tim burton creates his own tale based off of the book written by roald dahl a poor boy named charlie bucketfreddie highmore  wishes he could find one of willy wonkasjohnny depp golden tickets hidden in wonka chocolate bars around the world he opens a candy bar one day and his dreams are realized being tim burton i could already tell that this movie was going to be a much darker version than the first i was correct in this thought just looking at the introduction credits with a dark room with machines packing chocolate into containers tim takes the things that made the original movie sad and really capitalizes on them the personalities of the bratty children are much more annoying and charlie is extremely poor he even delves into the life of willy wonka which is very strange comedy is managed to be inserted in making it fun after capitalizing on wonkas oddities in the first movie wonka ends up being socially akward in a funny way i was exspecting this fiilm to be much worse than it was in reality i was surprised to see that more critics liked this than users the reason for this is most likely that people do not like to see a remake of a classic movie if a remake of the wizard of oz was made people would not like the idea of that and would move on i still cannot decide if the oompa loompa songs are extremely annoying or fun to listen to i leaning on the extremely annoying side i was exspecting the old catchy songs and these ones were techno and modernized
May 21 2011,positive,stick with gene wilder
May 20 2011,negative,as someone who actually read the original book as a child i was excited to see tim burtons take on it i was sorely disappointed this is without a doubt the worst adaptation of a book by roald dhal ever madethe acting is awful and the heart of the story is lost in an array of crazy effects and overacting
May 20 2011,negative,stick with the original
May 20 2011,positive,how oh how did tim burton manage to bring the book that i was borderline obsessed with as a child to life in such great detail while ruining alice in wonderland
May 20 2011,negative,too many songs and a monotonous movie overalljust not goodvery very boringsorry johnny but this movie really sucks and damnyou look like michael jackson in it p
May 20 2011,positive,as a fan of the classics i do find it very irritating when they take a film that has proven itself capable of standing the test of time and give it an unnecessary update however they managed to keep some of the charm of the originals and the cast was very strong not a complete failure but not a worthy successor to the brilliant willy wonka  the chocolate factory
May 18 2011,positive,in the spirit of all things roald dahl this was a pretty drastic step down imo
May 18 2011,neutral,i didnt think this was that bad

May 15 2011,positive,i dont like this as much as the 1971 version of the roald dahl classic book but it is closer to the source material
May 15 2011,positive,this was one of my favorite stories as a kid i would read the book over and over and over again in fact one day i was punished from video games so i took the book up to my room and read it i think i read this book more times than i read any other book however the 1979 film willy wonka  the chocolate factory wasnt too appealing because 1 it scared me 2 it was inaccurate when compared to the book so does this mean that this was the same as the original movie no this was in no way scary although it was a little quirky a word which here means weirdcrazy and it was more accurate this movie is about how acclaimed chocolatier willy wonka johnny depp closed his chocolate factory but is opening it back up to 5 lucky children who find golden tickets in his own wonka bars charlie bucket freedie highmore hopes to find one but might not because he only gets one a year however he along with german porker augustus gloop philip wiegratz spoiled english brat veruca salt julia winter junior world champion gum chewer violet beauregarde annasophia robb and tenacious video gamer mike teavee jordan fry win golden tickets but the challenge is that one who is the least rotten will win a special prize beyond their wildest imagination this film is funny weird cheerful and surprisingly heartwarming and is a great ragstoriches movie that surpasses the prequel in every which way

May 12 2011,positive,this film reads tim burton all over it not a bad attempt but unfortunately to burton cant help it to compare it with the first one now i know it aint the same story so it aint fair but the first film is such a masterpiece it just takes away the glow this film couldve had

May 3 2011,negative,ill give it credit for going deeper into the story of wonka but i found that the disgusting new brats and the scale of un wisdomed johny depp as wonka was just a key part in the tale that brought it down hard sorta kinda maybe i dont know

Apr 15 2011,negative,i liked the original better with agene wilder
Apr 15 2011,positive,really quirky and good
Apr 14 2011,positive,willy wonka johnny deppis the owner of the largest chocolate factory in the known universe but its been closed for years on its reopening willy hides only five golden tickets for the five kids that can get a vip tour of his chocolate factory one of those lucky kids is charlie bucket freddie highmore who discovers an amazing world inside    let me start off by saying johnny depp is unforgettable as willy wonka depp is a freaking great actor who i dont think has ever had a bad movie its these kooky and crazy roles that made him a superstar and he shines as this eccentric owner of the chocolate factory    tim burton is an amazing filmmaker known for movies like batman beetlejuice edward scissorhands corpse bride sweeney todd and most recently alice in wonderland and while this film does have fairly dark stuff in it it is a pretty decent family film     with beautiful scenery costumes and performances this will have many film fans wanting more chocolate     final verdict 83    between you and me i would be sick to my stomach if i surrounded by that much chocolate
Apr 14 2011,positive,liked it tho depp overacted at times
Apr 14 2011,positive,a good remakecreative but a tad bit strange
Apr 14 2011,positive,only because johnny depp 
Apr 13 2011,negative,the umpa lumpa ruined it
Apr 13 2011,negative,hate this movie with a passion  the old man really creeps me out and the boy is really wierd too
Apr 12 2011,positive,better when i was younger
Apr 12 2011,negative,this film was creepy i hate tim burton charlie and the factory was never suppose to be a horror movie but no fricken tim burton got to turn everything into a horror film that is far to futuristic and dumb terrible acting and a terrible new story is just what this terrible remake packs
Apr 12 2011,negative,whatever happened to tim burton  he used to make some of the most original and interesting movies ever  from his debut comedy masterpiece peewees big adventure to his dark and stylish batman films to his touching edward scissorhands he produced oddball hit after hit but in recent years he really seems to have forgotten what was so great about his movies  its like he thinks that the reason everybody liked his movies was because they were so weird and stylish but i myself just liked them because they were damn good  hes taken a more style over substance approach and while he has had a few good movies liek ed wood and the hammer horror tribute sleep hollow hes had more stinkers and charlie  the chocolate factory is one of them    first and foremost i have to address that this movie is not a remake of the 1970s classic but a readaptation of the book  at that its fantastic and closer to the source material than the original ever was but the fact of the matter is the 1970s film was good because it cut out all the stupid or more stupid stuff and turned it into a touching family movie this movie just seems like some crazy acid trip    charlie  the chocolate factory is about charlie bucket a hopelessly poor who for some reason is obsessed with willy wonkas chocolate factory  i could understand if he had been inside because its pretty crazy but from the outside its pretty average  willy wonka announces that for the first time in years he will let people into his factory in this case 5 children who can find golden tickets in his chocolate bars  charlie is lucky enough to get one after practically giving up and goes on the adventure of his life in wonkas crazy factory    i actually think this is a great story  in fact there are a lot of things about this movies writing that i can say are honestly great but the sad matter is all of them are taken straight from the book and cant be considered an original part of this movie    charlie is played by freddie highmore a pretty big child actor for a few years who does an okay job he isnt given nearly as much to say in this movie as the charlie was in the older one and it seems they were trying to focus more on the other characters  johnny depp plays willy wonka and he is downright terrible  i love johnny depp and he is the most versatile actor on the scene today but i think longtime partner tim burton finally found a part he couldnt soar at  i cant really say why hes bad hes just bizarre and unrealistic  to put it in the best terms hes no gene wilder the 1970s willy wonka  i know im comparing it a lot to the 1970s movie and i apologize but its really hard not to  the rest of the children are all prett good but no one is really a star in this movie  its like theyre all given an equal amount of screen time so no one really jumps out  the characters however are just as good as ever and i always loved how each of them is one of the 7 deadly sins a lot of people dont know that  one thing that is awesome is that christopher lee is in and plays willy wonkas father  its obviously another tribute to tim burtons love of the hammer horror films but lee is just so awesome    this movie definately has a style to it but i wouldnt say it works  the whole factory is bright and colourful and perfect looking whereas the outside world is gloomy dark and has a german expressionist look to it  tim burton previously used this contrast on edward scissorhands but unfortunately its not nearly as effective and just comes off as inconsistent  the factory definately looks interesting but bad cgi backgrounds are all over the place and it just looks too artificial to really blow me away  the oompa loompas also dont look as cool and i dont really like how its all just one guy cgid a million times    the songs the oompa loompas sing arent nearly as cool this time either  they are all different and they are the ones from the book but they just seem excessive and annoying  they are all sort of trying to parody styles one is disco one is the beatles andor monkees et cetera and they just sound weird  thats another thing im doing a lot saying the stuff is weird  i realise this film is just weird in general its pretty much just candy porn but the 1970s film proved that you can be weird but not too weird    i think this movie is really just trying to be weird just for the sake of being weird and it works  when this first came out it definately stuck out and grabbed my attention but with time you see just how disappointing it is and how tim burton really is washed up and just out of ideas in general  its just like all his other movies thrown together in one  its got all his typical actors his bizarre sets his same odd sense of humour his countless homages and just rolls it all together into one giant mess  charlie  the chocolate factory is one of his weakest efforts and shows the downward spiral hes been going on to his lowpoint with that dreadful alice in wonderland    i think there is one scene in this film that really sums up how i feel about this movie  wonka finds out how to put chocalte in tv via commericals that you can reach in and grab out  well it just so happens that he puts it into 2001 a space odyssey and turns the black monolith into a wonka bar  if you go messing with kubrick youre asking to be bad mouthed so tim burton consider yourself badmouthed  this whole thing is a disgrace to films in general comparing it to 2001 and thats exactly what this movie is an absolute disgrace
Apr 12 2011,neutral,im a big fan of the original
Apr 11 2011,negative,messed with a classic to cash in  not impressed
Apr 11 2011,positive,tim burton one of the great visionary directors of our time has added his own quirky touch to the chocolate factory and meanwhile bettered the original  out of all his movies ive seen charlie and the chocolate factory remains his most accessible work  johnny depps portrayal of wonka deserves applause for it is one of the outstanding achievements of this remake

Apr 1 2011,positive,johnny depp makes the chocolate and candy look 10 times better than the original as well as adding creepy flair
Apr 1 2011,positive,charlie bucket was the luckiest boy in the entire world he just didnt know it yet    a funny family movie with mild laughs and weirdness as usual tim burton shows now a days what kids are like and how they are turning out to be the story was good but the songs in the middle are very silly and weird johnny depp was as excellent as always all the others kids did job well the imagination of director and special effects are great too if you like tim burtons works you will like this
Mar 31 2011,positive,like original better depp wierds things out a bit

Mar 29 2011,positive,tim burton had not completely lost his touch then came alice
Mar 28 2011,positive,gene wilder johnny depp is not but he does make this his own movie too bad they focused too closely on comparisons to michael jackson the film stood well on its own
Mar 27 2011,positive,ma fav part wuz da chocolate i wish lied in a place lik dat

Mar 26 2011,negative,original rapes this crappy version

Mar 10 2011,positive,better than the gene wilder version in the fact that it stuck so close to its source material yes willy wonka was a pasty creepy guy who wasnt afraid to torture children if they werent good if youve read the book you will be delighted if youve only seen the movies i still think this comes out on top

Mar 9 2011,positive,another classic film great acting
Mar 8 2011,neutral,having grown up with the original film i cannot accept a few flaws in this new version yes the original had some flaws as well but it made up for them by having gene wilder and not having all of the oompa loompas be the exact same person

Feb 10 2011,positive,i love depp and what he brings to his characters but this fell short of being as good as the original
Feb 10 2011,positive,im a big fan of  tim burton i love all his moviesive read the book and i really liked the job he has done with this moviei loved the lessons the movie gave and the music as well as the cast and of course the directioneverything was colorful as it should have beeni loved the plot and i really liked johnny depp as willy wonkaamazing job done

Feb 8 2011,positive,to the young in heart
Feb 7 2011,negative,awful and needless remake just because tim burtons name is on the tin doesnt mean it isnt filled with shit
Feb 7 2011,positive,if anyone should have remade this tim burton is the right guy for it it would have taken a lot to compare to the original

Feb 4 2011,negative,this movie embarrassed gene wilder and poorly portrayed michael jackson whether that was deliberate or not
Feb 3 2011,neutral,original and this movie were both equally good johhny depp put on such a good role in this movie and it was a very enjoyable movie that would be good to sit down to and watch
Feb 3 2011,positive,not a patch on the original but a reasonable adaptation of roald dahls fantastic book aside from the weird subplot involving willy wonkas father this adaptation is more loyal to the source material than the 1971 original but that doesnt help it match up    even tim burton the craziest director on earth cannot even come close to the strangeness and quirk of the original film depp tries his hardest to bring wonka up to date and this is exactly the problem he tries too hard    perhaps without the stupid parenthood subplot this could have been a better film but unfortunately it ends up being ultimately fairly disappointing
Feb 1 2011,neutral,no one can beat gene wildereven johnny depp i didnt like the songs in this one as much as the first but johnny was good in it

Jan 22 2011,negative,the film wants so badly to be weird from johnny depps capricious grimacing performance to danny elfmans eccentric score to those damn everdancing eversinging oompaloompas
Jan 22 2011,negative,leave good enough alone
Jan 21 2011,negative,i dont know why i hated it especially when the film tried to become a musical like the first film and it just didnt work why the whole point is to move away from the original and make it your own piece of work it could be said that this adaption will appeal to a younger audience but i  make school age kids at work watch the original and the burton film every year and they always like the original better  i think a better remake could be madeits not bad just the oompa loompas make it painful  i did like johnny depp and that the audience got more involved in willy wonkas character
Jan 21 2011,positive,willy wonka dont lose your heads dont get overexcited just keep very calm    there is a lot of hate for charlie and the chocolate factory and really for no reason except that to quote every adult over the age of 35 it is nowhere near the original this should never have been made cry me a river who cares that burton remade a classic we act like if someone remakes a classic it somehow takes something away from the original like gus van sants psycho which isnt a good movie but people act like van sant should be hung for remaking psycho who cares if you dont like the idea of a remake of chocolate factory go watch the original and shut the fuck up no one wants to hear you cry about the original being better because in reality its not tim burtons is better i like the original too but burton did a great job with the remake he made it creepier more funny and the art direction is out of this world    johnny depp kills it as willy wonka freddie highmore is less annoying then then the kid from the original the other four kids are done way better here the backstory is awesome the factory looks better the dialogue is better the direction is better so the movie is superior to the first the people who dont think it is remember going and watching it when they were 6 years old and think somehow this is cheating their childhood burton made a better movie so get over it    this isnt burtons best movie but it is really good i hate to see people criticize this film because it is so good judge it as a single movie forget about the original while you are watching and you will love it thank you burton and depp for having the balls to remake a family classic    mike teavee who wants a beard   willy wonka well beatniks for one folk singers and motorbike riders yknow all those hip jazzy super cool neat keen and groovy cats its in the fridge daddyo are you hip to the jive can you dig what im layin down i knew that you could slide me some skin soul brother

Jan 16 2011,neutral,the new take on the film was interesting but i could not get pass the annoyance that was depps character this completely ruined the movie for me along with some bad story elements
Jan 16 2011,negative,dark awkward bore fest depp at his worst
Jan 16 2011,positive,given the choice between watching this or watching the original willy wonka starring gene wilder id choose the original every time but this is so different from the original and johnny depp approaches the character from such a different angle that you really cant compare the two i love this movie for what it is regardless of the fact that i to this day am not convinced that it should have been made in the first place johnny depps performance is amazing as usual and im glad he turned it into something completely different because otherwise this entire film would have been a train wreck
Jan 15 2011,negative,deep went way to creepy story is closer to the book that the original movie still love gene wilder
Jan 15 2011,positive,really didnt like it much
Jan 15 2011,neutral,an unnecessary remake
Jan 15 2011,positive,nice but i dont consider it a masterpiece also johnny depp seems a bit locked in the character and doeant give his touch to it
Jan 15 2011,positive,absolutely loved it teriffic performance by my fav jonny depp watched it recently and since we had to return it to the library both of us watched it again the next day  a must must see for every1

Jan 12 2011,neutral,funny but weird its good enough for check it twice
Jan 12 2011,positive,i owned as soon as it came out i mainly loved this movie for one major reason it gave me the insider look at willie wonkas life and showed me his background unlike the original the original is still no1 tho
Jan 12 2011,positive,charlie and the chocolate factory is the second film adaptation of roald dahls classic childrens book of the same name it is directed by tim burton i greatly enjoyed this film charlie and the chocolate factory is actually far more loyal to the original book than the 1971 classic willy wonka and the chocolate factory the film actually uses the same songs from the book but they are shortened i greatly liked how they updated the children to the modern times i liked the songs done by danny elfman very much i enjoyed johnny depps performance as a weird quirky willy wonka very much like in the book but i love gene wilders perfect performance far more in my opinion gene wilder will always be willy wonka overall this is a very good adaptation of the book but i did not enjoy it more than the first adaptation of the book
Jan 12 2011,negative,johnny depps acting is no match to willy wonka so thats a bit of a killer
Jan 12 2011,positive,haah its great cus i love candyd
Jan 11 2011,negative,although depps performance seems ok wilders wonka will never be surpassed and more we learned from mr michael bay that visuals cant prevent you from making a crappy movie no soup or chocolate for you mr burton

Jan 10 2011,positive,jd is amazing in anything he does

Jan 5 2011,neutral,johnny  tim  awesomeness couldnt be better than the original though
Jan 5 2011,positive,a very good interpretation its not a remake of the original so get down off of that horse you cant compare the two
Jan 4 2011,positive,easily one of my favorite johnny depp roles  he keeps the movie playful and dark too  minus the oompa loompas which i found almost worse than the original this remake was better than the original

Dec 31 2010,negative,weird  not that enjoyable
Dec 31 2010,negative,terrible should never had remade ruined
Dec 30 2010,positive,i love tim burton and johnny depp and they do not dissappoint it was a very magical film that really make my imagination go wild although most people do not like it compared to the 1970s version because it is more darker and just altogether different what they dont realise is that this is exactly what it is supposed to be like it is identical to the book and they even use the songs roald dahl wrote which is a touch i just loved and it really made it what it was meant to be like so altogether i loved this film and i am really glad they made this i would recommend this great family film to anyone
Dec 29 2010,negative,hated it not even close to the original
Dec 29 2010,negative,i love johnny depp and tim burton which is why i would honestly tell them in a very sweet voice that this movie was a horrible remake     some films work when they stick to the book well othersjust dont i grew up with the original movie and i have also read the book this film does a great job with sticking to the book but the unfortunate result is that the story just doesnt work as much some plot elements were changed in the original and for good reason because they were either too silly ie being attacked by squirrels which is what happens in book and is thus used in this film or just really didnt really add enough depth to the character ie the monotonous charlie in this film whereas in the original movie charlie seemed more realistic and appealed to audiences better johnny depp as willy wonka was justshudders creepy the last thing willy wonka needs is to resemble michael jackson yes youve heard that a thousand times but it still remains as a relevant and  accurate viewer interpretation of his portrayal i felt that gene wilders willy wonka could never be topped by anyone else and i think this movie proves it i mean nobody can possibly top his evil smirk in the mind trip tunnel scene for the original     all in all the purpose of charlie and the chocolate factory was to introduce readersviewers into a wonderful and enchanting chocolate factory run by a gentlehearted man and his helpers with new and creative ways of creating candy this film just made me want to get the fck out of that factory there is just no heart or charm to this film at all an interesting ride at best i appreciate the updated visuals and characters especially the deeper look into willy wonkas past but noit just doesnt work for mesorry     you know now that i think about it i wonder what director chris columbus would have bought to the table that would definitely be worth seeing not to any discredit to tim burton he is master of his own art but just not with this story in particular     note i know i really shouldnt have compared this movie to the original as much but i had to make the comparison in order to make my point of why this film doesnt work in how the story is presented
Dec 29 2010,positive,great movie only annoying thing is the fact that that all the oompa loompas are the same people
Dec 29 2010,negative,gene wilder was bettersorry johnny
Dec 29 2010,negative,one movie that shouldnt have been remade johnny just made it weird

Dec 28 2010,positive,creative movie and fun 2 watch
Dec 27 2010,positive,i know the original is old and doesnt have flashy effects but that is why i liked this movie they didnt add much to it except the ending
Dec 27 2010,positive,eye candy and dark with a side of weird its the holy trinity in a movie
Dec 27 2010,positive,wasnt one of tim burtons best but you can still come out and say it was allright
Dec 27 2010,positive,a great movie by burton  adaptations    definitely not the verbally playful 1970s version but then again thats never been burtons main focus  he used technology to twist out a modern approach to the wacky side of wonka as well the grandeur of the wonka factory    some of the playful words of roald dahl are lost in this version but the emphasis was not only the chocolateer in this movie  each kid got more attention post ticket win than int he first movie cutting out some of the verbosity of wonkaonly riddling talk from the original movie    some of the adaptations to the characters seems presumptuous and a bit damaging to the original work  but for the most part changes were a great new work  the depiction of the town was greater than the common city in the 70s version but sadly this one didnt display the initial candy shoppe joy  the nut room display was pure genius hats off     overall a decent script great graphics visionary oompa loompa storyline finally brought to life and an indescribable factory whose magic finally revealed
Dec 26 2010,positive,good but some parts are plodding the movie is saved by depps poignant portrayal
Dec 25 2010,positive,excellent kids show and good entertainment for adults  very nice adaptation of novel
Dec 24 2010,positive,im not sure what johnny depp was thinking when he did this
Dec 23 2010,positive,definitely a darker version of the 70s version but it turned out to make it just as good also i applaud the director for making depps character willy wonka so sarcastic really makes a funny movie
Dec 23 2010,negative,the originals waaay better
Dec 22 2010,negative,kind of freaky cant beat the original with gene wilder
Dec 22 2010,positive,ok but sorry johnny the original won this one hands down
Dec 22 2010,neutral,cute but cannot replace the original willy wonka with gene wilder
Dec 21 2010,negative,good but johnny depp was a bit annoying
Dec 21 2010,positive,though i love johnny depp this cannot begin to compare to the original
Dec 20 2010,negative,i didnt really like this movie
Dec 20 2010,neutral,prefer the old version sorry but i love johnny depp in this movie
Dec 20 2010,positive,tim burton puts another classic through his gothic filter  only this time it worked
Dec 19 2010,positive,a fun rollercoaster ride of a movie tim burton and his cast and crew add more subtle emotion visual dazzle and sophistication than the 1971 original and apparantly this adaptation stays more truthful to the source but nonetheless both versions still capture the magic imagination and spirit of roald dahls literary classic with johnny depp giving one of his weirdest quirkest most original performances to date 55 stars
Dec 19 2010,positive,weird not like the originalbut it was greattim burton great
Dec 18 2010,neutral,its even sort of funny
Dec 18 2010,neutral,always makes me want chocolate

Dec 15 2010,neutral,type of film you only want to see once
Dec 15 2010,positive,like the older movie a lot more
Dec 14 2010,positive,i can not compare this to the originalhoweveer it leaves its own mark
Dec 14 2010,positive,like it sooooooooooooo much and read the book
Dec 14 2010,positive,it was okay good fx the pace was down from the original
Dec 14 2010,neutral,adam sandler should have got this part as charlie
Dec 13 2010,negative,i love that other world with full of chocomaniacs
Dec 12 2010,neutral,made me hungry for chocolate
Dec 12 2010,negative,while this burtonesque film is unique and strikingly different from willy wonka and the chocolate factory i dont think its additions and changes in characters and mood successfully temper sadness with joy as both the original material and the first movie do
Dec 12 2010,positive,johnny depp was twisted
Dec 11 2010,neutral,not as good as the older ones
Dec 11 2010,positive,this was brilliant in its own right but there were a few things that i thought could have helped it

Dec 5 2010,positive,it is specktacle over story but not by a lot
Dec 5 2010,negative,ugh  i dont like this willy wonkap i like the original so much better
Dec 4 2010,positive,tim burtons rendition of roald dahls timeless classic is deviously dark and deliciously appealing just as insane dark and genius as the original story it was pageforpage adapted from proving that adaptions can be just as good as the original source material
Dec 4 2010,positive,i firmly believe the best part of this movie is any scene with the oompa loompas
Dec 4 2010,positive,tim burton needs to just be friends with his friends and stop putting them in remakes this and alice and wonderland are pretty creative and neat but the style and humor is getting old tim is gona only hit hot topic kids for the rest of his life what happened to big fish and pee wees big adventure
Dec 3 2010,positive,no where near the original

Nov 26 2010,positive,j deppit was ok nothing ever beats the original
Nov 26 2010,positive,ive admitted that willy wonka and the chocolate factory is one of my top 20 favorite films so when i heard they were going to remake it i got a bit skeptic but i still saw it anyway and overall it was okay its nowhere near classic and tim burton has made much better films than this but its a decent film overall the acting is okay the songs are catchy as hell and very creative and the plot follows the book a bit closer
Nov 25 2010,negative,johnny depp is god awful in this movie and most he is in with 2 exceptions
Nov 25 2010,negative,i have a feeling that a lot of people are going to dislike charlie and the chocolate factory because of the nostalgia factor there was already a 1971 film called willy wonka  the chocolate factory so why did tim burton feel the need to remake this one i can see a lot of people asking this question and rightly so the first film ended up becoming a cult film and ive met quite a few people who like to deny the fact that anyone other than gene wilder can play the character of willy wonka    i dont have that nostalgia clouding my vision of what willy wonka should be or what the film should look like as blasphemous as this may sound i never got around to seeing the 1971 film im aware of how that may sound but to be honest that movie never interested me i had no desire to see it and therefore never did    without any clouding of what i thought would happen when a film adaptation of roald dahls book was created i watched charlie and the chocolate factory i ended up being let down this is mostly because of depps performance as willy wonka but also by the plot and script the visuals look great however and you can tell that burton was certainly having fun creating his own vision of the world inside the chocolate factory    willy wonka himself is an odd character and this doesnt work the way you might think it is wonka is so weird its like he is existing in his own world he acts completely different from every other character of in the movie it is almost like you arent supposed to fully understand him which makes it far stranger that a backstory is tacked on to explain almost everything that wonka does    as a child little willy wasnt allowed to eat candy see his father christopher lee is a dentist and therefore doesnt allow him to eat any this is the entire reason for him starting up his chocolate factory through flashbacks it is made clear that we are supposed to care about willy despite the fact that he doesnt act anywhere remotely close to how a human being would actually act i can see how he could be a slightly offbeat character given the fact that he hasnt had human contact for years but i dont think that he would forget about how to interact with humans in that period of time he clearly spent his childhood at school the place where many of the fundamental social behaviors are learned    there are also a few problems that come from the plot there isnt really a reason to care for any of the characters within the movie everyone in charlies family is poor and they all have reasons that you would want to care for them but the film seems to try to play with your emotions in a way that makes you dislike them the other children and their families are also disliked but for different reasons theyre supposed to be that way however like charlies family this is hammered into our heads in fact just out of spite to the film i wanted one of the other children to win the fabulous prize at the end of the film    i realize now that i havent even touched upon the main story of the film yet well charlie bucket freddie highmore is a poor child who has a birthday coming up he lives in a town which has the singular highlight of possessing willy wonkas chocolate factory wonka hasnt been seen in years but in a shocking change of heart has hidden 5 golden tickets in his latest batch of chocolate bars the children who find these tickets are allowed to enter his factory for a day and one of them will end up with a glorious prize    coincidentally charlie has a birthday coming up and his birthday present is a singular chocolate bar tragically this bar doesnt end up containing a golden ticket discouraged charlie wanders into town where he finds money on the ground instead of taking this money home and giving it to his parents they are quite poor after all he selfishly goes and buys another candy bar rejoice as he got a golden ticket soon he and his grandfather meet the rest of the lucky recipients and everyone gets to go inside the factory turns out wonka has hidden motives in his warm invitation one that involves teaching some naughty children big lessons    one inside the factory the film does marginally improve we arent beaten over the head with the circumstances that each of the characters has and instead we get to focus on the visuals theyre quite stunning and are always a treat to look at no pun intended i swear they are creative and never become a bore to look at sadly they only feature as a backdrop to the rest of what is going on    charlie and the chocolate factory is a film that kind of makes me want to see the 1971 film that was adapted from roald dahls book i want to see if the cult status is has attained makes it a better film than this one this film isnt great or even all that good its beautiful to look at but it lacks in its characters and in the way that johnny depps willy wonka acts hes supposed to be an odd character and while he is tacking on a backstory that attempts to make you feel for him ends up making you care far less than you should
Nov 24 2010,positive,i love all the willy wonkas but this was definately my favorite
Nov 24 2010,positive,marvalous or should i say scrumdidilyumpsious
Nov 24 2010,positive,it aint scary like most tim burton flicks but this one still entertains and excites us all

Nov 22 2010,neutral,original still the best
Nov 22 2010,positive,this movie makes me hungryhehehehe
Nov 21 2010,negative,i really wanted to like this movie according to reports roald dahls family preferred this version over the 1971 original it had the ingredientstim burton johnny depp and a boatload of money alas it didnt work for me part of the problem for me was giving willy wonka a back story by giving an explanation for his motivations the magic and mystery of the character was lost also the character was made rather awkward and creepy i have read the book and i dont recall him being like that maybe im sentimental in favor of the original it was more faithful to the source material but sometimes what is good in the writing doesnt always translate well to the screen
Nov 21 2010,positive,i love this movie  i practically grew up with it it has wonderful music great acting lovely visuall effects  it has a classic burton twist exapmles creepy intro  disturbing puppets burning up scene although 1 thing has always remained a mystery 2 me  thats why the heck does willy wonka look like a woman
Nov 21 2010,neutral,depps starting to bug me now

Nov 18 2010,negative,like it cause johnny depp is in it

Nov 14 2010,negative,seen the movie i dont like it
Nov 14 2010,positive,tim burtons version of the infamous cholatier is full of the trademarks that he revitalized through his films johnny depp in another weirdo winner
Nov 13 2010,negative,why remake a film that was so good the first time why risk ruining such a brilliant classic childs film this burns the first to its foundations and attempts  to rebuild it with the book fully in mind they even cast johnny depp who gives the only good preformance to try and boost the films integretty but it fails miserably it gives the back story we didnt want to know and ruins the oompa loompa characters
Nov 13 2010,neutral,original is much better
Nov 13 2010,positive,nice love this sooooo muchie
Nov 12 2010,positive,its ok first is better

Nov 10 2010,neutral,too weird and the original has a charm and soul this one lacks
Nov 9 2010,negative,all that really needs to be said is that there should be no human alive that can possibly like this version better than the one with gene wilder the movie was actually pretty alright until johnny appeared from then on it was terrible and i couldnt wait for it to be over i have always liked both johnny depps and tim burtons movies but this just sucked    first of all willy wonka shouldnt have looked like a transvestite second he was actually meant to be a genius depp portrays him like hes a stupid child i didnt believe for one second that wonka was anywhere near smart depps portrayal was neither funny or imaginative just annoying and creepy nothing he says is worth laughing at on the other hand gene wilder was fantastic in the original he captured oddness with humor and intelligence    the oompa loompas songs were just retarded while the original had memorable songs this one had typical bubblegum trash not to mention the fact that one actor is portraying all the oompa loompas is lazy and not believable i didnt really like the orange men in the original but id take them over the annoying aztec warriors any day     the kid actors were pretty good and thats a big plus compared to the rest of the film im aware that this one is more true to the book but it still doesnt do it any justice im also aware roald dahl hated the original but im pretty sure he would hate this one even more because i highly doubt he imagined willy wonka as someone out of the rocky horror picture show overall i really hate this movie i hate it with a passion
Nov 8 2010,positive,liked the original charlie  the chocolate factory wgene wilder was more enchanting
Nov 8 2010,neutral,it had some elements i liked in it but the original was better so much so that its immeserable

Nov 2 2010,positive,johnny depp makes it worthwhile
Nov 1 2010,positive,tim burton did this didnt he
Nov 1 2010,neutral,the beginning is nice and the childrens performances are good  but it is very disappointing as a tim burton take on a roald dahl story  burtons films are generally enjoyable to watch and depp is a pretty capable actor  but sometimes they make some of the weirdest decisions that even by their own standards dont work  such is the case here
Nov 1 2010,positive,it was good but a little too odd even for willy wonka those flashbacks were getting annoying the first one was a lot better
Nov 1 2010,positive,i absolutly love jhonny depp but not as good as the original
Nov 1 2010,negative,johnny depp was too creepy original was way better
Nov 1 2010,positive,tim burton depp combo always good its a whole other worl
Oct 31 2010,positive,one of the few remakes of the last ten years that is a good movie while it still lets the original stay a classic this is indeed a different version tim burton could never make a film like the original depp is great and highmore is wonderful as charlie but the design sceme is the true star amazing to look at
Oct 31 2010,positive,i did like this movie but it was just dumb when all they did was flashbacks of him this movie shouldve just kept it like a remake instead of confusing people
Oct 31 2010,positive,love it love it at all a so funny movie i love the story and the message that it gives johnny excelent like always i laughed all the movie when the ommpa lompas starts to sing and dance hahaha more than a such good movie
Oct 31 2010,positive,compared to willy wonka and the chocolate factory this film follows the book more closely although it does recycle a few elements from the 1971 film and having new elements while gene wilders version of willy wonka is a more serious character johnny depps version retains the charm from the book overall i prefer the 1971 film over this one but its still good
Oct 31 2010,positive,not my favourite burton film but still quite enjoyable not as good as the original

Oct 27 2010,positive,a very faithful for better or for worse retelling of the classic roald dahl novel tim burtons vision of the story is visually stunning and funny as well as being a good reminder to be careful what you wish for
Oct 26 2010,negative,bad remake the original is a classic this one sucked

Oct 21 2010,positive,as to whether or not the remake was better than the original film is disputable i still loved the 2005 version though i think a sequel for this could have been made as well unfortunately it was not to be the caseat least not for now anyway

Oct 16 2010,neutral,charlie and the chocolate factory stars johnny depp who definatly takes on a different role then usual i had a good time watching most of it but there was definatley room for improvment next time im in an ompaloompa mood ill just stick to the classic version
Oct 16 2010,positive,it keeps the feel of the book  the pacing and dialogue is faster the movie is darker funnier and has some great supporting actors  the songs by danny elfman are wonderful  it all makes up for depps miscast and out of place performance and like almost all tim burton movies a boring and unnecessary back story about parenting issues
Oct 15 2010,negative,pretty dumb and extremely boring its quite a surprise that so many people like this childish notsocharming movie that is definately burtons worst film
Oct 15 2010,positive,better than the original
Oct 13 2010,positive,this film was alright but it was somewhat creepy in some parts then again so was the original
Oct 12 2010,positive,kinda funny but didnt hit too many new things from the original movie for me
Oct 12 2010,negative,not one of my favorite sorry
Oct 11 2010,neutral,i thought depp looked a little bit pedophileish in this movie his teeth were too white and the feel of the movie was just overall weird and oompa loompas sucked
Oct 11 2010,positive,i would have given it 5 stars had they given johnny depp the same song that gene wilder sang in the original version 
Oct 11 2010,positive,this film is a great family film
Oct 11 2010,positive,enertaining but had a bit too much spectacular sights than spectacular story though more accurate than the 70s version

Oct 2 2010,positive,nowhere as good as the original
Oct 2 2010,negative,the original is much better just because this one follows the book moreand trust me i read the book and did a book report on it in elementary school does not make it a better movie

Sep 28 2010,neutral,it was creepy but ok i guess
Sep 28 2010,positive,i thought it was a decent remake and that it was good to go into the character of willy wonka a bit more just to make it different from the original one problem i have is freddie highmore i dont know what it is but there is just something very annoying about every character he plays still though this isnt going to remembered as a classic and regarded as highly as the original but its still an entertaining and different take on the original story
Sep 27 2010,positive,ggood movie although performance by depp is scaringly good although i dont like it well portrayed as it is like in the book
Sep 27 2010,negative,didnt like it as much as the original
Sep 26 2010,negative,aka every tim burton movie ever made
Sep 26 2010,negative,watch willy wonka and the chocolate factory and you see why this one should be discarded
Sep 26 2010,positive,original is the best
Sep 24 2010,positive,johnny but i am more a fan of the original
Sep 24 2010,positive,i love fantasy movie especially about chocolate
Sep 24 2010,neutral,great movie 420 friendly
Sep 24 2010,positive,this is a good family movie
Sep 24 2010,neutral,some may think that im being too hard on this movie or being too hard on tim burton lets just make this clear this movie is not the worst movie ever made and i still love tim burton i just think the original is a better movie there are some elements that i like better in this movie namely the visual style and the explanations of some plot holes from the first film i liked the kid actors in this movie too except freddie highmore but i did not like johnny depp as willy wonka     i like johnny depp as an actor but i absolutely loathe him in this movie i loathe freddie highmore in this movie too because he portrayed charlie much too saintlike and didnt seem like a real kid to me sure hes acted well in other movies but just not in this one charlie is also so underdeveloped that hes but a fifthstring player to the other kids and wonka there was also another thing that bugged me willy wonka and the chocolate factory was more about charlie but this movie is much more about wonka than it is about charlie sort of a marketing mistake on their part but anyway onto johnny    i did not like johnnys portrayal of wonka one bit first of all i dont care about his backstory and i felt that was just distracting from the rest of the movie his character is also all over the place the first thing that didnt make sense was that he put out golden tickets for five children but when they come to the factory he didnt seem to even give a crap that they were there his speaking voice was also much too highpitched and annoying for my taste and he was mean to the kids when he knows one of them will be running their factory i also didnt appreciate the scene at the end where he was telling charlie that he had to leave his family forever that was just plain unpleasant to watch i could rant on and on for paragraphs but we need to get to the rest of the movie    the mistakes of johnny are compensated for just barely by the acting of the rest of the kid actors and the supreme talent of deep roy i have great respect for deep roy as an actor and i have more respect for all the work he had to do playing every single oompa loompa i also liked how they updated on the stereotypes of the kids and i can still see the biblical undertones despite the updating of the kids and the explaining of the plot holes from the first film the story doesnt seem to hold up for me even if it may be closer to the material    speaking of plot holes there are some from the original that are explained in this version for instance the movie shows that willy wonka sends out golden tickets saying that he wants five children  not just five people to run his factory how would gene wilder know that coincidentally five children would find the golden tickets the also made violet a winningobsessed champion not just a gum enthusiast they also updated her mother more making her a mom who pushes her daughters victories to the extreme mike teavee is also more obsessed with videogames than he is with tv and his parents seem to be more lazy and more willing to let technology raise their kid    needless to say charlie and the chocolate factory is not the worst remake ever made but its my least favourite tim burton movie and johnny depps secondworst performance behind the tourist the visual style is cool and the other kids besides charlie are some pretty decent actors and the music is okay not nearly as good as the classics in the first film but it just doesnt seem to hold up for me all in all see it if you want some may like it i just dont the original is and always will be the better film
Sep 24 2010,negative,i get what depp and burton were going for here but it wouldve been wiser to avoid this remake entirely nothing can top gene wilders classic performance
Sep 24 2010,positive,nice movie i love u freddie highmore
Sep 23 2010,positive,fresh take on an old classic burton does well with his artistic vision and lavish visuals
Sep 22 2010,negative,what little i saw of it i didnt like  as a kid i remember loving the original charlie and the chocolate factory  although this movie lacks the benefit of childhood nostalgia i still think its crap  i mean the cheesy armchair psychology about willy wonkas relationship with his father is so forced and coerced its pathetic    why try to mess with the fun unambiguous moral fable and childish fantasy of the old one  trying to add depth to willy wonka in such an artificial way is defeating the purpose  its like trying to add journalistic credibility to glenn beck its just stupid
Sep 22 2010,positive,its an enjoyable film with the signing of tim burton
Sep 22 2010,negative,really admire johnny depp but you a wouldnt let his wonka anywhere near children

Sep 14 2010,positive,johnny depp is worth watching
Sep 14 2010,positive,very interested movie
Sep 14 2010,positive,tim burtons adaptation of roald dahls distinguished story combines his always imaginative stylistic wonderful techniques and johnny depps awkward portayal of willy wonkaits filled of wonderment and extravagance

Sep 12 2010,positive,not bad but not good enough
Sep 12 2010,positive,im a great bigggg fan of johnney depp
Sep 12 2010,neutral,johnny depp is amazing
Sep 11 2010,negative,you cant beat willy wonka
Sep 11 2010,positive,kind of creepy and not particularly memorable nothing can top the gene wilder version
Sep 11 2010,neutral,johnny depps cool and all but gene wilder was way better this is one of those movies that just couldnt have been remade any better the orignal is on a league of its own

Sep 10 2010,positive,loved the book loved the movie
Sep 10 2010,positive,ok movie johnny does not even recognize willy wonka character

Sep 5 2010,negative,first one was better
Sep 5 2010,positive,johnny did such a great job as willy wonka i really like this movie
Sep 5 2010,positive,one of my fave movies
Sep 5 2010,negative,probably burtons worst film definately a low point for depp his wonka is highly annoying more than anything as if hes doing a bad joe pasqualie impression the film plods along and gets worse with every scene no match for the gene wilder adaptation
Sep 5 2010,positive,a remake of the original this remake carries within it some of the wierd style of tim burton the same man responsible for such films as sweeney todd the nightmare before christmas to name a few this trust between tim burton and its lead actor johnny depp is apparent in this remake with both styles of the actor and the director meshing well in this film its astounding that johnny depp has such versatility in the characters he plays from the out of place detective in the film sleepy hollow to the monstrous sweeney todd johnny depp once again concieves a new interesting and excentric character for this film tim burton has an eye for the weird and the odd which sets this film apart from its predecessor it also has a twisted sense of humor with little dancing men     the films basic plot is about a young boy charlies adventure within willy wonkas chocolate factory     the original was great but this to me seems to be a worthy film to carry the flame of the original or at least lead people to check out the original
Sep 4 2010,positive,a good movie directed by the worlds greatest director tim burton willy wonka will take you on a magical thrill ride of color and humor
Sep 4 2010,positive,while neither as memorable or as magical as the original charlie and the chocolate factory gives you what tim burton almost always guarantees strong and innovative direction breathtaking visuals and wellhandled storytelling save this movie from its alltoowierd lead performance from johnny depp as an adaptation of roahld dahls famous novel it gets topmarks until it decides to spend a 15 minute detour near the end on a contrived morality lesson
Sep 4 2010,neutral,the original was better
Sep 4 2010,positive,liked the origanal better
Sep 3 2010,negative,i love johnny depp he is one of my favorite actors but seriously this movie was terrible not that the original was something to be proud of but at least the original was a horror movie in its own right
Sep 3 2010,positive,good movie  its about how family is important in our lives
Sep 3 2010,positive,johnny depp christopher lee
Sep 3 2010,positive,very different from the 1971 movie but just as good

Sep 1 2010,neutral,i love chocolatethats why i like this movieimagine having all that choc mmmh
Sep 1 2010,positive,as much as i enjoyed the original willy wonka and the chocolate factory i like this version better mainly because i was already a fan of the original book by roald dahl awesome author and since this one stayed closer to the book i enjoyed how they portrayed the scenes from the book once again the stand out character in the movie is willy wonka who this time is played by johnny depp depp takes a whole new approach to playing the eccentric candy maker and this version is much closer to the line between whimsically funny and awkwardly insane which i wasnt as big of a fan of what i truly was happy about was the revamping of the oompaloompas truthfully the original version didnt entertain me it annoyed me with their really cheesy songs so this update was refreshing charlie and the chocolate factory adds in new pieces of plot delving deeper into the backstory of the man himself willy wonka and i found it fascinating and it gave the story a deeper tone than what i was expecting overall of course this movie cant replace the original version with gene wilder the better wonka but its a refreshing update that was cleverly made with brilliant visuals and a great script go see charlie and the chocolate factory
Sep 1 2010,negative,hated the updatedtoo weird
Sep 1 2010,neutral,interesting but then again it is johnny depp but i like the original better
Aug 31 2010,positive,nice to see with the children good sense of craziness
Aug 31 2010,positive,its so weird that not even burtons masterful abilities make me like this film completely i love the first 30 minutes before the kids go the factory when the golden tickets were being found around the world those moments are perfect but when they go to the factory and wonka depp appears then the movie is too weird and sometimes annoying for my taste however i like the ending and christopher lees cameo
Aug 31 2010,positive,id love to watch this again with my younger sibs
Aug 30 2010,negative,absolute fail tim burton you were wrong
Aug 30 2010,positive,i love johnny depp but im a big fan of the original film because its part of my childhood

Aug 25 2010,neutral,not like the classic
Aug 24 2010,positive,meh i liked the original better
Aug 24 2010,positive,this is a fairly zany and imbalanced movie my initial reaction years ago was exuberant sadly the movie has not kept well with time and it is clearly one of tim burtons worst     most are familiar with the story about a poor boy charlie bucket miraculously winning a golden ticket and touring the mogul willy wonkas factory four other children all with nasty and undesirable dispositions are also elected theyd better prepare for a tour unlike any other because wonkas chocolate factory is one of the most bizarre and possibly dangerous places in the world i think audiences were unsuspecting too     johnny depp assumes the role of the rich chocolateer willy wonka its very hard in todays society not to think of gene wilder so depp was left on his own to interpret the motives and inflections of the character history shows that depp has triumphed in the past consider pirates of the caribbean and numerous other burton movies unfortunately depp wasnt so lucky here in this movie depps willy wonka is an estranged oddball introvert with a sense of humor emulating that of a pedophile and an odd haircut that only further accentuates his eccentricity i suppose if depps goal was to make the character match the tone of the film than he succeeded but thats not to say its a great tone in the book wonka was truly eccentric but also knowledgeable persuasive terse and intimidating depps wonkahas none of these qualities he becomes zanier as the movie rolls along the only catharsis to this unusual exhibition is some flashbacks inserted under burtons guild to elaborate on why wonka chose to become a chocolateer and why he has such a distaste for parents burton fans will delight at the flashbacks but theyre not necessarily useful in fact they prolong the film    the protagonist is charlie bucket who proves to be less interesting than the factory owner although this is for any adaptation charlie is a goodhearted and honest kid growing up in an impoverished world he values family and completely contrasts willy wonka maybe that was the point of this adaptationto provide a stronger connection between the two titular characters admittedly it worksbut not necessarily with depps interpretation again wonka is too damn weird its even unnatural hearing him have a normal conversation with charlie at the films epilogue     from a visual standpoint charlie and the chocolate factory still shines through with burtons trademark style of gothic influence and exotic colors he also stayed truer to the book than the 70s version and introduced the homeland of the oompa loompas as well as the subplot with prince pondicherry these were recreated loyallybut for a film with its main purpose to deliver a compelling and effective story i have to ask myself if they were absolutely necessary sometimes translating a book to screen in verbatim has its advantages at other times condensing cutting and eradicating the fluff is a favor of the scriptwriter who reveals just how extraneous the sourcework really was     charlie and the chocolate factory i repeat is about as bizarre and unusual as gummi bears in a peanut butter sandwich it falters in the performance of its leadquite honestly miscast at least if wonka were jim carrey wed understand the zaniness i can appreciate burtons zest for recreating and bringing to life a classical story that emphasized pure imaginationid just rather hear it sung from gene wilder     ps on another note i think depp wouldve made the perfect charlieand im not kidding around just rewind thirtyfive years
Aug 24 2010,positive,it gave me a good laugh weid though
Aug 23 2010,positive,need to be heavily sedated with reefer and acid to enjoy this 
Aug 23 2010,positive,johnny depp is good in anything as far as im concerned lol ive been a fan since 21 jump street and i watched nightmare on elm street a few times before i realized johnny depp was in that movie also  hes been around for quite awhile he deserves some awards
Aug 22 2010,negative,quite good but the first out of the 2 they have done was the best the 2nd remake is a load of rubbish
Aug 22 2010,positive,not as good as the 1971 version but every bit as funny i miss the old oompa loompas spelled ridiculously wrong johnny depp was creepy in this movie

Aug 16 2010,negative,the original will always be the best never beaten
Aug 16 2010,negative,bad remake of a great classic
Aug 16 2010,neutral,not as good as the original
Aug 16 2010,neutral,depp works great as the weird michael jacksonish wonka as usually is the case when he works with burton  except for the god awful alice in wonderland this together with highmores performance and a very interesting work of art design are ultimately the only good things i found here well i did hate those old orange oompa loompas
Aug 16 2010,positive,love it yummm

Aug 13 2010,positive,what a freaking great interpretation of the book for one it actually followed the book unlike the original movie johnny depp was hilarious freddy highmore and all the other kids were great actors the oompa loompas made me laughand i love tim burton hes so creative
Aug 12 2010,neutral,the same charm that made the original very good just isnt here johnny depp looks weird
Aug 11 2010,negative,too strange seems to try too hard to make it somewhat funny with raw talent from the kids it makes it even more annoying to me i say it ruins the classic for me we needed someone like wilder in this one depp tries his best on being him but is still way off
Aug 11 2010,positive,johnny depp nailed this role
Aug 11 2010,negative,i saw it and it was good
Aug 11 2010,neutral,okay  guess i like willy wonka and the chocolate factory better
Aug 11 2010,positive,not as good as the original but i liked creepy johnny depp
Aug 11 2010,neutral,johnny being outlandish but i still like willy wonka better

Aug 10 2010,positive,this is my favorite movie it has all my favorite genres in one movie and it has a classic amazing story

Aug 7 2010,positive,i love the original and i love tim burton the perfect movie for him to remake very good
Aug 7 2010,positive,johnny depp can just do any role there is in the world great movie
Aug 7 2010,positive,this remake is so different to the original its like watching a completely different film i applaud that they took it in a different slightly more sinister direction and for that reason you cant really compare it to the original depp makes the film his own and i really enjoyed it
Aug 7 2010,positive,jhonny depp was good but it wasnt as good as the original
Aug 6 2010,negative,not as good as the first one
Aug 6 2010,positive,great film jonny depp was great 
Aug 5 2010,positive,steve burton movies are way to out of this world

Aug 4 2010,neutral,was okjohnny depp could have done better
Aug 4 2010,negative,the original is better
Aug 4 2010,positive,really good movie at the time it was released
Aug 4 2010,negative,good film the other one is better tho
Aug 3 2010,negative,the only redeeming role was sweet little charlie i absolutely detested jonny depps accent
Aug 3 2010,negative,depp is adept at weird characters but wilder gets the honour mentally for me as being willy wonka     burton over gothed this one when he did not need to  roald dahl stretches the imagination but the  original suited the relative innocence and wonder of the tale than did the modern revamp
Aug 3 2010,negative,johnny is amazin but there really is only one ww
Aug 3 2010,negative,depp really cant match wilderand depp comes across as a peodophile
Aug 3 2010,negative,original was much better
Aug 3 2010,positive,its not the the story but whos with me watching the movie
Aug 3 2010,positive,catharsis of being an escapist of the reality and becoming a fictional winner

Aug 2 2010,negative,this movie and the new remake of alice in wonderland yulk johnny why do this to the classics
Aug 2 2010,positive,really enjoyable tim burton  dahl seem to be perfectly matched much closer to the book than the old musical version
Aug 2 2010,positive,wonderful remake of the original with jonny depp the perfect actor for wonka this film changes several elements of the original and has much better inventions and scenery
Aug 2 2010,positive,love this movie never gets old amazingly funny
Aug 1 2010,positive,i love the orginal but then one is modern and edgy
Aug 1 2010,neutral,probably one of the worst jonny depp movies if not the worst to date it just seemed like depp did not put any real effort more like just turned up made some silly faces and a few one liners and took his huge pay check and ran     the character of willy wonka in the book is a lot more complex     and speaking of the book if your a literary purist like myself then you will have to agree that this film takes some major liberties with the original script and does not do it any justice no matter how entertaining it is     may be this is why i have given the film a 50 rating and not 40 or less because it was entertaining and that is all it has going for it
Aug 1 2010,negative,not to keen on this a bit frighten for kids loved the first one
Aug 1 2010,positive,i was surpirsed about this remake it was still loyal somewhat to the original and it still had its own changes in it i think depp was good for the role of willy i still like the original guy but depp did good being this character as i said b4 this movie had their own scenes like the nut room and the ending that what really got me about this movie it was a better ending to me because it actually explains what happens after charlie won the prize overall this was a great film for me but the original is just amazing no matter what for those who gave this a low rating i hope u just didnt do that because u loved the original a lot i did but remember you always leave your mind empty when watching a movie you should never have bad or good feelings about a movie when its just starting
Aug 1 2010,positive,not bad johnny depps portrayal of willy wonka was somewhat baffling and over the top
Jul 31 2010,positive,i liked the story better than the original but the music was not as good
Jul 31 2010,positive,it was okay personally like the original better
Jul 31 2010,negative,could be a better remake
Jul 30 2010,negative,blasphemous to the original
Jul 30 2010,neutral,just as creepy as the original wouldnt want to see it again
Jul 30 2010,neutral,again love depp but nothing beats the original  this was a creepier version to me than the original  gene wilder is wonka
Jul 30 2010,positive,the old version i hope
Jul 29 2010,positive,good but didnt live up to my expectations  the original adaptation with gene wilder is superior
Jul 29 2010,negative,consider crispin glover who played wonka on epic movie to replace the overrated depp
Jul 29 2010,positive,used to own it until the nephews got a hold of it
Jul 29 2010,positive,i honestly thought that the orrigonal was better
Jul 29 2010,positive,i love chocolates
Jul 29 2010,negative,johnny depp has to be gay
Jul 28 2010,negative,other than depp the actors give thin performances and the charm from the original is lost because of it tim burton gave an interesting portrayal of the classic but it just cant stand up against it
Jul 28 2010,positive,i luv this movie i hav it on dvd and i luv watchin it
Jul 28 2010,positive,johnny deeps particular flavour of acting has drawn elements  of criticism much like helena bonham carter in that both possess the ability to portray eccentricity and the unusual brilliantly but without the established credentials of acting branching from outside such a category similar criticism to that levelled at tim burton the director of charlie and the chocolate factory and my first foray into the gothic worlds of the lauded loved and loathed team to find an answer to curiosity  and criticism    adapted from one of the most famous works of rightfully legendary author roald dahl i am inclined to believe that tim burtons adaptation remains at least closely faithful to its parent text  the twits georges marvellous medicine and the bfg being my preferred works and i confess to never having finished the book freddie highmore plays the hero charlie bucket son of an impoverished family fortunate enough to discover a golden ticket earning him a place on a tour of the fabled chocolate factory by willy wonka himself johnny depp    with his reputation as it is burton seems to have discovered a treasure trove of workable material in the form of roald dahls works with such a simple premise as storyline the invitation to elabourate upon the lavish details of dahls imagination are gratefully and wonderfully seized upon by burtons talents many directors seems to represent direction from another field if cameron didnt direct then his profession would lie within the technical field of film eastwood very much the actingdirector and burton the director raised from photography and cinematography    much of the films appeal lies burtons visual treats and crafting the juxtaposition of charlies bleak greyrinsed world of poverty contrasts with the colourrich factory offering his optimism and sunny personality an escape and playground the scripting is light and playful reflective of a film aimed at the younger audience and with depps willy yes its childish embodying the evergreen child harmed by the adult world depps display is far from instantly loveable but the intention to make it so is clear and the characters development takes the form of flashbacks steadily exposing the wonkas eccentricity and insecurity which excuse and endear the manchild     whereas wonkas character grows in appeal burton and his cast presents an endearing and emotional wrenching purity from the outset acclaimed young actor freddie highmore provides emotional and character depth beyond his years maximized by small yet highly significant roles for helena bonham carter and noah carter as mrs and mr bucket that truly show the strength of the family bonds that effectively are at the core of charlie for a small period the movie seems to still between the sympathy deliverance from charlie and family to wonka propped up by truly bizarre happenings in the magical factory    burton depp and bonham carter may not have moved fully out of their eccentric comfort zone but such aforementioned criticism seems truly unfair given the variation for weirdness open to them burtons typically colourful and creative world manages to be both tangible absorbing and strangely untouchable simultaneously laced with wonderful nearpsyhcadelic imagination roger ebert questioned the influence drawn by depp for willy wonka and in the awkward childhood and bizarre appearance perhaps michael jackson entered into consideration children will find plenty to delight in whilst others will find honest entertainment and surprising depth behind the colours and playfulness held together by brilliant contrasts and beautifully endearing performances
Jul 28 2010,positive,loving the new version
Jul 27 2010,positive,totally love the movie  feel happy whenever i watch it  bring out the child in me lol 
Jul 27 2010,negative,this movie was dumb heres why first the music sequences were all about how to use cgi to blow you away problem i was not blown away but like some scarecrow in a field torn up by a tornado yet somehow remaining i was privy to the destruction wrought on the fertile field of my mind by this abhorrent film some poor jerk sold his soul to the devil to make people like this movie for those of you held under the sway of this infernal bargain you have my sympathies
Jul 27 2010,negative,i like the 80s charlie and the chocolate factory
Jul 27 2010,positive,i liked the river out of chocolate

Jul 19 2010,positive,again love depp regardless what he does though he was amazing in this movie

Jul 19 2010,positive,a very bad remake of the spectacular willy wonka and the chocolate factory
Jul 19 2010,neutral,a poor remake to a classic film  i respect what burton wanted to do but ultimately his take on the movie will always be inferior even if it was meant to be a reimagining rather than a remake
Jul 19 2010,positive,must see for kids but not really enough to get me entertained 
Jul 18 2010,positive,saw it was pretty good
Jul 18 2010,positive,you cant help but compare this to the 1971 original and compared to it i think it defintley missed the mark but comparing aside its a relatively good film johnny depps got nothing on gene wilder but he brings his own accentric style to the film that only a tim burton film would allow the majority of the musical feeling the original had is gone and replaced with more storyline but it isnt necessary overall it had it flaws but visually looked very cool and was rather enjoyable to watch
Jul 17 2010,neutral,strange adaptation of the dahl novel depp is too goofy trying too hard to be strange original worked much better even if the oompa loompas are awesome
Jul 17 2010,negative,this movie is very good and many scenes make me feel suddenly very interested in

Jul 14 2010,positive,i finally saw the tim burton version with my kids the other night and i must admit i was hooked now dont get me wrong being that it is im a child of the 70s the gene wilder version will always be special to my heart but who can resist burtons imaginatively delicious sets and danny elfmans catchy dare i say cheesy music score while i wont go as far as saying i liked the newer version better i will say that tim burtons willy wonka is a successful remake that can stand out on its own
Jul 14 2010,negative,scariest fucking movie
Jul 13 2010,positive,hate how people rip off tim burtun for trying to create a modern version of it
Jul 13 2010,negative,orjinal was way better
Jul 13 2010,positive,for most people the original willy wonka and the chocolate factory is a classic family movie i am one of those people i watched it as a kid and i fell in love with eveything about it    both of these movies are based on the book charlie and the chocolate factory by roald dahl the basic story is charlie is a poor kid he comes from a poor family who all live together in a small beaten down house one day its announced that willy wonka the eccentric owner of the chocolate factory is holding a contest he has placed five golden tickets in five random chocolate bars the lucky winners will be the first civillians to ever enter the chocolate factory    there are four winners who are all brats these kids are stereotypes of certain kids theres one who always plays video games and is a techgenious theres the spoiled girl who you just want to throw off a building then the overachiever who always wins at any cost and last is the fat german kid whose always eating    then theres charlie whoses just lucky and happy to be there    because this is a remake i will compare it to the first one tim burton has a dark imagination and he adds his own twist to this the visuals are better in this version but that is mostly due to the technological advancements     the two wonkas gene wilder was perfect as the crazy chocolate maker he is both wacky and endearing johnny depp is a great actor and he has made over seven movies with tim burton he is a favorite of burtons but here he looks pale and creepy instead of being wacky his just weird and not the appealing kind depp does try but wilder was like i said perfect   in this new one they gave a long back story on wonka where he came from why he become a chocolate maker why his soo eccentric i enjoyed how they presented it and knowing more about wanka was great but one of the things that made wanka soo great was that you didnt know why he was the way he was it gave him an air of mystery    the oompaloompas in the way santa has elves willy wonka has his own little helpers the orange skinned oompaloompas in the original its never explained where they came from but in this one were given a back story as to where they came from and how they came to work in the chocolate factory that wasnt bad i liked knowing more about the loveable characters     the main thing about the oompaloompas is that they sing when they work and the songs in the original and amazing both fun and memorable you can help but hume or whistle them they unforgetabble  in this one not soo much i liked the way they did make the songs according to different eras in music such as disco and rock and roll but the songs were more annoying than appealing they werent bad just not something i wanted to listen to i do want to give some credit to the guy who played the oompaloompas he had to play all of them still the original one were better    and the two charlies the original one was more of a real kid he got angry he got sad he was relatable because he acted just like a kid would but this new charlie he soo fucking nice what a goody two shoes he got annoying everything he said was soo pleasent and sweet     i admire tim burton putting a new look to this and for the most part i liked the movie it is closer to the book than the original the acting from the kids was suprising good the visuals were great to look at but it lacked the emotional punch i got from watching the original one   its still a good movie if you want to watch it you should but the original one is a classic    interesting facts oddly enoughroald dahl did like the original one and tried to detach himself from it also something else the original one even though called willy wonka and the chocolate factory its more about charlie than wonka and this one charlie and the chocolate factory is more about wonka than charlie ironic isnt it
Jul 13 2010,positive,that was a yummmy movie
Jul 13 2010,positive,much less creepy than the original johnny depp is awesome
Jul 13 2010,positive,willy wonka is the best
Jul 12 2010,positive,disturbing the original is better
Jul 12 2010,positive,depp depp depp actor of the generation
Jul 12 2010,positive,rereview    people frequently ask me why do i love this movie so much the burton remake of willy wonka thats so childish i cant actually say why do i like it so much but i have heard some people saying this is a bad remake of the 1971 movie people you have to see that this is not a remake of the movie this is an adaptation from the book  and a great one for that matter     i only watched a bit of gene wilder movie but what i saw i actually didnt dislike but my order was burton movie reading the book 1970s movie and for what i read and saw from the 70s version it is not a bad movie but it is a bad adaptaion from the book and in that point if you watched the three too i think we all have to admit that it is more close to the roal dahl story  he didnt like the 1970s version actually for that same reason    the story is well known charlie bucket is a poor boy that lives with his parents and grandparents he hears one day that a chocolate maker called willy wonka is healding a contest through is candy hiding five golden tickets who can give a chance to five children of visting the factory charlie doesnt have to much chances but he suddenly sees his chance and embarks in an amazing journey    as i said i have no clue why i enjoy this so much maybe because i love chocolate too i dunno it is a pretty basic and childish story but it helps having a great director behind it the characters makes us root  or not for them and the whole movie is a giant magic experience the sets are great and all the movie is simply a great piece of storytelling    i am one of the few people that actually loves johnny depps willy wonka realy he is a great actor and i think that in this one he pulls it over mainly because there is a big focus on the characters story and backstory he is wickedly strange and yet so likeable i also liked freddie highmores charlie because that kid was the charlie after reading the book i saw this was probably a perfect charlie the resto of the cast was pretty good too and the soundtrack is catchy  too cachy sometimes    maybe the message it passes of always being good and be rewarded is nothing new  well it is a relatively old book but i dont care it transmits what it wants and delivers a great magical experience into the screen
Jul 12 2010,negative,i just didnt like it that much i thought the whole movie was  a little to over the top i know that is the point of the factory but i still just didnt like the feel of it i just didnt like depp as wonka no a big fan of this movie

Jul 11 2010,positive,compared to the original not great
Jul 11 2010,positive,johnny depp and tim burton did an awesome job on this movie and it was just like reading the book
Jul 11 2010,neutral,great on acid sober not so much
Jul 11 2010,positive,charlie and the chocolate factory is dark chilling and quirky johnny depp is super as the creepy eccentric and socially inept willie wonka i dont see how this film is a childrens film as i think its too dark and heavygoing i can see how the moral relates to children that greedy spoilt and obnoxious children will be punished i think the way the message is shown is a bit too harsh for a child audience i actually think charlie and the chocolate factory is more geared for an older audience as it brings out issues such as the parents shaping their childrens behaviour and mental imbalance which is depicted through willie wonka this film should be at least rated a 12 however i think the film is brilliantly acted and the child actors are especially impressive i like the idea of the escapist chocolate utopia which is enchanting for both adults and children i still think that this is an excellent film and it will have you daydreaming about chocolate    grade a
Jul 11 2010,positive,not one of johnny depps best movies
Jul 11 2010,positive,johnny depp rocks i love his work

Jul 10 2010,negative,special effects were good but i still liked the first one better
Jul 10 2010,positive,this is true eye candy  with charismatically obnoxious child stars the innocent charm of the young lead freddie highmore and of course lashings of johnny depp goodness little can go wrong in this crazy blend of gothic tim burtonness fancy fx a subtle plot twist to freshen things up a bit and an uncontrollable imagination
Jul 9 2010,negative,i love johnney depp but i just dont like him in some movies like this and alice and wonderland
Jul 9 2010,positive,i love the original dont get me wrong but i think this one might have to be my favorite its incredibly funny and we actually get a background story on willy wonka which is great

Jul 7 2010,positive,nice movie for kids that love chocolate
Jul 6 2010,positive,in this film the silliness and actor johnny depp are the two big things that make this story different than the 70s version and oddly that works but the silly songs in this film are the major low points of the film but other than that an excellent remake
Jul 6 2010,positive,i prefer the original

Jul 6 2010,positive,well i have only seen it once or twice so i go with 3 stars
Jul 5 2010,positive,alright charlie and the chocolate factory the remake of a film made in the 70s and actually takes the real name of the book so does the film live up to the original and the book it almost lives up to the original but it is still a good film and it does live up to the book there were some additional things in this movie added by tim burton with some lines scenes props and anything else tim burton adds in to make the film a little creepy but its still a good movie now willy wonka and the chocolate factory is the best this film does live up to the original but again it almost lives up to the original now i have to say the actors were good charlie was good danny elfman is still burtons main composer helen b c is still in any tim burton movies including johnny depp oh and count dooku makes a cameo as will wonkas father in this movie now johnny depp is the perfect actor to make willy wonka more creepy and likable it seems that whenever tim burton puts johnny depp in his movies johnny always seems to act out his role perfectly there was a lot of cgi in this movie and it was alright but what was really stunning about this movie was that actors really knew how to act out their roles this is close to being a perfect movie but it will never be better than the original my final tomatoemeter rating is 86
Jul 5 2010,positive,it was alright i like the original one way better
Jul 5 2010,positive,hey children watch  this  
Jul 5 2010,positive,johnny depps acting is great

Jul 3 2010,positive,jonny deep back on form
Jul 3 2010,negative,didnt think much of this at all very sketchy at best and sure that dahl would still be turning in his grave in comparison to the original they seemed to have got more of the feel for the book but still falls short of what it could have been
Jul 3 2010,positive,very funny johhnny depp is awesome
Jul 3 2010,positive,i really like this movie
Jul 3 2010,positive,although its a great movie i think the original was much much better theres too many boring flashbacks in this one it also doesnt give out the oh i feel so sorry for charlie factor and also the creepyness of the whole film  the original was better by far it doesnt suit modern day times its in the olden days where theyd have to be very lucky to even get a chocolate bar nevermind a trip to the factory itself
Jul 2 2010,negative,original is much better
Jul 2 2010,negative,i dont like the changes this movie is not to be touched and messed with and they managed to do just that i like the songs in the original and the predictable ending its called a remake for a reason to remake a movie this wasnt a remake this was a rewrite
Jul 2 2010,neutral,kinda weirdnot as good as the first one
Jul 2 2010,positive,this was a remake of willie wonka  the chocalate factorybut he did pull it offbecause he likes those corky character roles

Jul 2 2010,positive,the original was much better though
Jul 2 2010,negative,this movie was terrible scared the crap out of me
Jul 1 2010,positive,i love chocolates  and i love johnny depp
Jul 1 2010,positive,gene wilder will always be my favorite willy wonka and the oompa loompas are far more charming in the original but this film does greater justice to the original text by ronald dahl i really enjoyed johnny depps performance and i thought he did a better job of bringing out the eccentricities of willy wonka then wilder however the original film did a better job of capturing the wonder and excitement of the chocolate factory and the musical numbers are stronger its a great film overall but the weakest part is having one actor play all of the oompa loompas im sure this is an attempt by tim burton to inject further oddness into the world of willy wonka but it felt uninspiring and tacky to me despite these negatives the films ending is wonderful and superior to the original
Jul 1 2010,positive,daniels review 8 out of 1080      a fine remake but jonny depp will never be gene wilder
Jul 1 2010,negative,my auntie loved this movie seen it too many times lol

Jun 30 2010,positive,the original was the best
Jun 30 2010,positive,nice nicenice ive seen the old and first of this and the new with johny d
Jun 30 2010,positive,tim burtons charlie and the chocolate factory is a visual feast although very different from the original movie it stands on its own very easily this is in most part due to johnney depps amazing performance as willy wonka i daresay he did a better job than gene wilder much as it pains me to say plus i always love it when a movies plot stays as true to the book as possible even with the update to more reflect modern society which works wonderfully by the way the modern oompa loompa songs are also fun very different from the original i guess the real treat of this movie is that it never tries to be like the willy wonka and the chocolate factory and instead tries to be whatever it wants and it works watch it if you can
Jun 30 2010,positive,it does manage to get a little too creepy at some points but its still a pretty fun ride
Jun 29 2010,positive,i dont know why people hate this film its a close adaptation of the book and a good remake of the original classic
Jun 29 2010,neutral,this is watchable but for tim burton i feel its a little bit too lame they songs dont even compare to those involved with the original film

Jun 27 2010,positive,one of my favorite characters portrayed by johnny depp

Jun 16 2010,positive,johnny depp looked kinda creepy but i liked it
Jun 16 2010,negative,once again burton twists source material to make it all about depp  the movie was more about wonka than charlie with added wonka backstory that slowed the movie pace and prevented charlie character development or even audience sympathy  why was charlies dad alive
Jun 16 2010,neutral,not as good as f1rst
Jun 16 2010,positive,what would you do with so much chocolate i would like to have one of those inventions lab

Jun 14 2010,positive,i really dont consider this movie a remake if it was a remake it would be called willy wonka and the chocolate factory and be loosely based on the book charlie and the chocolate factory but it is a more faithful adaptation to the book and is extremely charming and beautiful this is my favorite tim burton movie because he fuses his wonderful twisted mind visually with a great story this does have a great story and it even adds the back story of willy wonka and proves to be extremely useful the child actors do an amazing job the set design is something dreams are made up of and wonderful musical numbers many did not like this movie because of johnny depps crazy performance but i think it is one of his best we are never sure of what his intentions are and i love the long devious looks he gives throughout and the horrible way he treats most of the kids and his parents the other amazing things is how johnny depp never breaks out of character you know it is johnny depp but he never gives into letting anyone realize its him and most importantly it made me forget i was watching a movie meaning all in all everything worked so well together it did its job
Jun 14 2010,positive,oh my god can you imagine that in that huge factory there is a land that everything are edible the candy grass the chocomilk riverand also the waterfallwaaaaaa  i wish that will be coming true in my lifehahahahahaha    pssssti also love the oompa loompa they were very funnyhahaha

Jun 9 2010,positive,the first half of the movie was made beautifully however it slowly goes downhill from there the oompa loompas are also a problem to me not a fan of the modern music and just because you are exposed to cgi doesnt mean you can ruin an oompa loompas identity

Jun 5 2010,positive,while ill always prefer the original over this one this one does have alot of things that are much better than the original some of the children are updated like violet mike teevee and a few others however the main characters got worse charlie is a little too perfect in this movie he acts more like an adult than a child and willy wonkawell i think he got a little too much attention the visuals are great tim burton really knows how to make the world for his movies look like something out of a fairy tale if charlie was move focused on and both he and wonka were fixed this movie would probably do better honestly i could argue between the two movies for a long time but in the end its going to still be the original that ill like more

May 27 2010,negative,typical burton affair all style no substance
May 26 2010,positive,oh johnny depp  i liked this movie and i like most tim burton stuff only thing i really thought was unnecessary was burton adding in a backstory for wonkatrying to explain the reason for his eccentric nature being his ppparents

May 18 2010,positive,the original with gene wilder was betterdepp makes it a little dark
May 18 2010,positive,not as good as the original
May 17 2010,positive,i like it because johnny depp was in there
May 17 2010,positive,i really liked this remake of course johnny depp but the original scared me more
May 17 2010,positive,a movie much alike to the movie willy wonka and the chocolate factory and both that movie and this movie are great personally i love the whole idea of a whole place made entirely out of candy it really spreads out you imagination and how you see things i think anyone would enjoy this great movie
May 17 2010,positive,love this film a whole lot more than the original
May 17 2010,positive,awesome and johnny depp

May 16 2010,positive,love the original better
May 15 2010,positive,much better that the original
May 15 2010,negative,just another depp movie meh
May 14 2010,positive,its one couldnt and shouldnt compare to the first adaptation as tim burton provides his own wit and charm along with johnny depps quirky willy wonka in what i consider to be a successfully dark and unique adaptation of the book
May 14 2010,positive,i know that the original film is a classic and gene wilder seems like the quintessential wonka but i absolutely loved this movie it was completely hilarious had really catchy songs and did much more in the way of characterizations i love that we got to learn about wonkas past charlies family grandpa joe was amazing and even the individual children who visit the chocolate factory i love the cast in this film and i think johnny depp did a fantastic job of making an iconic role his own
May 14 2010,negative,i love tim burton and deppbut this film is no good to put it nicely
May 14 2010,positive,grew up with it duh
May 14 2010,positive,i loved chocolate n its inspired me to make a chocolate factory p
May 14 2010,negative,this was so awful it was offensivethis wasnt even in the same ball park of how good willy wonka  the chocolate factory was
May 13 2010,negative,i liked the original but the remake just didnt add up to the expectations it really sucked compared to the original at least i feel like it did
May 13 2010,negative,sorry burton  deep this is not one of your better films
May 13 2010,neutral,this what i mean no reason to fix something that not broke  willy wonka and the chocolate factory was nothing wrong with that gene w  did an awesome job  i believe the kids would of still loved the origianl movie jonny depp great actor however this one was a little to much  there was no need to remake it  i really like gene better sorry jonny
May 13 2010,positive,truer to the book and wonderfully creepy but jd is no gene wilder
May 13 2010,positive,a wonderful adaptation of dhals work
May 13 2010,positive,hello starshine the earth says hello
May 13 2010,positive,this is a remake of the classic movie willy wonka and the chocolate factory tim burton managed to get his touch to this otherwise sweet story and it turned out fantastic johnny depp plays the wacky willy wonka and i always love when depp plays those wacky role because hes so much fun to watch if you like tim burton and johnny depp this movie is definetely one to watch perhaps with your family
May 13 2010,negative,fell asleep at the movie
May 12 2010,negative,god i hate this movie thats really vague and mean but its how i feel this was a movie that i had an open mind for when i saw it but i came away feeling robbed of the joy and sense of wonder that i still take from the original this one was just weird and pointless johnny depp not one of my favorite actors but one i still respect and admire was pretty lousy and awful in this movie the kids were just annoying and werent very fun to watch as was most of the other characters in the movie the tone was just campy and made me take no emotional investment into charlie and his situation the only thing i really liked was the inclusion of christopher lee i guess i either love the first one way too much or the movie really was a big chunk of shit my opinion doesnt really matter though cause im in the minority on this one unfortunately
May 12 2010,positive,well i wouldnt say that the remake is as classic as the wonka version btw anyone notice how the wonka version focused on charlie and the charlie version focused on wonka but its a solid remake tim burton and johnny depp are the big hollywood combo these days i do say burtons style is good and i do like his style a bit better than that guy who did the wonka version but the rest of the movies key concepts are nowhere as big as the original i might be going a bit nostalgia critic here for one thing charlie is more like a saint in this one i dont criticize freddie highmore or anything but that wasnt how that ostrum kid did it in wonka also wonka is a bit more stranger in this one not that depp is a bad actor its just that he doesnt resemble gene wilder that much but with a great score by danny elfman and two visionary geniuses at the helm burton and depp this movie is a great remake of a classic book it actually follows the book a lot more than the wonka version how about that
May 12 2010,positive,very good lacks the true magic of the original
May 12 2010,positive,not as good as the original
May 11 2010,neutral,watch half and fall asleep
May 11 2010,negative,for me its boring

May 10 2010,positive,my kids liked it but origional was better
May 10 2010,positive,preferred the original
May 10 2010,positive,i like it better than the 1st one
May 10 2010,positive,tim burton johnny depp deep roy freddie highmore and roald dahl what could be a better combination  this movie was brilliant i love the fact that they wrote in a reason for wonkas weirdness  i thought johnny depp was absolutely brilliant as always of course and freddie highmore was perfect  the visuals were epic the music was catchy the acting was spoton the story was coherent the plot was followable is that even a word and it was altogether a great movie with a great message  i would watch it a million times over    candy doesnt have to have a point thats why its candy
May 10 2010,negative,depp fits the role perfectly
May 10 2010,neutral,the original was better
May 9 2010,positive,good book remake johnny depp played a slightly scarier willy wonka than gene wilder in the original movie but i love them both the book is written by one of my fav childhood writers roald dahl
May 9 2010,positive,this is my favorite movie
May 9 2010,positive,it was an ok movie i liked the other version better
May 9 2010,positive,burton nearly reaches the caliber of the original a fantastic visual and heartfelt expirence dazzles throughout
May 9 2010,positive,without johnny depp the film isnt sweet
May 8 2010,negative,it would have been an ok movie if it werent a remake of willie wonka the original was so much better because mr wonka knew exactly what he was doing the whole time in the new one he was just jhonny depp not that i dont like him in fact i think he and annasophia robb violet saved this movie from being a total waste of time
May 8 2010,positive,the fantasy is great 
May 8 2010,negative,charlie and the weird guy that might rape you
May 8 2010,positive,i had no intention of liking this since im a fan of the original but i really like this johnny depp is a very creepy willy wonka but overall i enjoy this movie

May 7 2010,positive,that cursed song will be stuck in my head for years on end willy wonka willy wonka the amazing chocolateteer willy wonka willy wonka everybody give a cheer yipee shivers well it dosent live up to the origional but i have to give the film credit it was a very nice try it did a decent job of staying accurate to the story without feeling exactly the same in fact i like a couple of the changes they made for instance violet played by anna sophia robb not a bad actress at all is definatly improved i never did like violet in the older movie some girl who umlikesgumnot very interesting here shes a winning obsessed sports champ raised by a soccer mom definatley a better character wonka played by johnny depp very good choice of actor is given more of a backstory which makes wonka himself also more interesting heres the bad news and thats charlie himself here charlie is played by a kid named freddie highmore never heard of him here charlies character is very poorly written he just dosent seem like a realistic kid in the old movie charlie had some selfish attitudes at some points hes only a kid and you know its part of growing up this kid on the other hand never did a single thing the least bit bad just a total perfect angle the whole time it simply dose not seem realistic hey i just realised somethingcome on chaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaatlie were going to willy wonkas candy mountai i mean factory sorry i couldnt resist meanwhile its a decent movie but didnt live up to the origional
May 7 2010,positive,a very entertaining and interesting take on the classic childrens tale

May 5 2010,negative,not as good as the origional
May 5 2010,neutral,umm in this kinda movies this one is worse i dun hate it but its like an uncompleted pazzelstill interesting tho
May 5 2010,positive,hmthe movie and visual is a bit weird although johnny plays a great partstill like the older version better maybe because it wasnt as dark as the new one
May 4 2010,positive,wasnt the biggest fan of the movie but it had some fairly good scenes
May 4 2010,positive,not nearly as good as the origional willy wonka
May 4 2010,negative,one of the worst movies ive ever seen
May 4 2010,negative,gene was much better depp is awesome in just about everything but this tim burton was a bad choice too
May 4 2010,positive,not crazy about this one but sure the kids love it
May 4 2010,negative,rubish the 1971one beter
May 4 2010,negative,wasted my time watching it
May 3 2010,neutral,not really terrible but johnny depps wonka is just creepy i liked aspects of it but again depps performance brings the picture down i kind of wish that gene wilder was thirty years younger as does he im sure so could have taken depps role dont get me wrong not a huge fan of the original just wilders performance
May 2 2010,positive,johnny depp is a god great movie
May 2 2010,negative,i tried to love it i really did
May 2 2010,positive,yeaaa chocolate n johnny depp

May 2 2010,negative,liked the old one better
May 1 2010,positive,not even close to as good as the original but i never expected it to be so it was descent
Apr 30 2010,neutral,which one gene wilder was superb
Apr 30 2010,positive,ahhh the perfect marriage weird book and weird actor johnny was perfect for this role and the inclusion of helena bonham carter gave me fangirl goosebumps     everything about this movie was fun it was bright and colorful and candycoated with a notsosubtly hinted message giving kids everything they want makes them brats that was really roald dahls point but the movie made it beautifully clear     i found this incarnation of the classic book to be infinitely more enjoyable than the 70s version not because of all of the flashing lights and cgi additions but because it seemed more like the book willy wonka wasnt some creepy guy who looked like he was about to steal the children by offering candy out of an unmarked van he was just creepy because he was an eccentric shutin and in this film that creepiness was explained as a peter pan complex mingled with a traumatic childhood     the kids were perfectly cast and acted covering all the main childhood stereotypes except bully i would have loved for dahl to include a bully in the mix just to see them get whats coming to them depp did a fantastic job conveying the complexity of his odd character which is what he does best in my opinion and there was just the right mix of quirkiness and truth to it to make it appealing to kids and adults
Apr 30 2010,positive,one of my favourite actors
Apr 30 2010,negative,i cannot stress how much i hate this version i love johnny but this was horrible the original is a classic and they turned it into something creepy i worry some kids might have nightmares
Apr 29 2010,positive,great charlie and the the chocolate factory is an amazing kids movie with loads of interactive songs and beautiful graphics tim burton does it again johnny depp makes a great willy wonka and makes the experience odd and enjoyable although different than the latter wily wonka this is an enjoyable movie for adults and kids alike
Apr 29 2010,neutral,a decent enough remake and this is coming from someone who loved the original i liked the first half everything before willy wonka first appears more than what came after it was well done but it was nicely polished and it fit in better for the target audience than the original one of the reasons i loved the original so much as a child because i saw all the sexual and deviant undertones and was amazed that it was supposed to be a kids movie i liked that different people took different things away from the movie but how most people didnt see it at so many levels as i did this one just played everything pretty straight the new oompa loompa songs were cool but i like the old ones better i missed some of the scenes from the old one especially the boat ride and song i really liked the new kids in this one and that they showed the outcomes of them at the end
Apr 29 2010,negative,was varey disappinted n it

Apr 23 2010,neutral,this movie is hard for me to rate i really liked it when it first came out but its neither tims or johnnys best work i also didnt like that helena was a filler character burton also gave wonka a back story which was honestly lame my opinion is if he wanted a plot twist he either should have had someone else go with charlie or have johnny playing an older charlie as a continuation of the last film this is just one of those films that shouldnt be remade honestly
Apr 23 2010,positive,i like the quirky retelling combined with warmth and darkness not oscar material but compelling and fun
Apr 23 2010,positive,best film ever absolutely fantastic
Apr 23 2010,positive,johnny deep and tim burton2 freaks making great movies
Apr 22 2010,neutral,charlie and the chocolate factory showcases tim burtons keen eye for crafting elaborate set designs and johnny depps usual mugging but ultimately falls flat from a joyless script and burtons muted direction

Apr 21 2010,positive,though it may not be as good as the original it sure comes close instead of a regurgitation of the classic burton puts a nice new spin on charlie and the chocolate factory making it one of the best remakes

Apr 18 2010,neutral,falls short of the original the kids seem much better in this one but johny depp comes across as a creepy pedophile rather then a magical chocolatier plus this focuses more on willie and has an unnessecary attempt at pulling at your heartstrings but it just adds to the cheesiness

Apr 8 2010,neutral,i rewatched this on tv on a sunday with nothing better to do its ok but not outstanding its really dies down towards the end of the movie i also did not enjoy the new additions to the story but thats just me
Apr 8 2010,positive,back in about 200405 when i first saw the trailer i got pretty excited for this movie i wasnt a tim burton or johnny depp fan back then i hardly knew who they were i was excited about this because it was a new version of willy wonka i had always loved the story    when i went and saw it in september 05 i ended up pretty happy with it i really liked how tim burton didnt try and make it like the book he got the story and made it his own    there are some things that make it better than the original this one had the story of the indian prince the glass elevator was  actually completely glass the oompaloompas sang the actual words that they were meant to sing written by roald dahl and then danny elfman does a good job of putting the words to a tune and this also showed the four children after they were fixed up another good thing was that it didnt have that annoying scene at the end of the original where gene wilder goes all angry i never really liked that scene  but you still cant really replace the original that ones got some great songs and good acting    there was something in this that wasnt as good as the original and that was the characterisation of charlie freddie highmore didnt really look like he was having fun making this movie because he didnt seem as happy as charlie should have been hes just too gloomy   something that i didnt get about this was who the story was meant to be about its called charlie and the chocolate factory and at the start theres a whole introduction to him so we think were watching a movie about charlie but when we meet willy wonka we forget about charlie and its all about him    but overall i would say that charlie and the chocolate factory is a delightful new take on the story
Apr 8 2010,positive,4 kids fall for his tricks but the one does not fall for his tricks the five of them try some of the things in it and the girl that is bossy always and i mean always get her way i wish i was her everybody wishes they were her
Apr 8 2010,negative,ugh what the heck happened tim burton is usually a great director and johnny depp is usually a great actor so why is this movie so uninteresting poorly written and altogether painful to sit through why
Apr 8 2010,neutral,old version was better
Apr 8 2010,positive,the main character was the best one
Apr 7 2010,positive,tim burton is a master at taking any movie and making it dark johnny depp is flawless and the kid isnt half bad either its short on jokes and showed a bit too much chocolate for my stomach

Apr 6 2010,neutral,not bad but not good
Apr 5 2010,negative,while charlie and the chocolate factory may have a strong supporting cast and a great visual design tim burton has missed the point of the source material and has turned the movie into a personal daddyissues movie    charlie is too much of a saint to be a good character and wonkas dialogue is just painful and inconsistant there are some great moments the oompa loompa songs are catchey and the supporting kids are great but the movie has a messy narrative structure and misses out the heart of the original film and the source material
Apr 5 2010,negative,i dnt like this movie and willy was very rude
Apr 5 2010,positive,charlie delivers as a tasty treat but will probably make you feel a tad sickly if you have too much     ok so i had to include a confectinary related opening gag sorry     one of tim burtons more family friendly effort is a real return to form for the director after apes and fish proved to be magicless and dull for different but still unforgivable reasons   here though and pretty much since also depp and burton have revived the butonesqeness we have all come to love so deeply in what is the better version of classic childrens sweety story the plot of which everyone knows little girl it isnt mr bs best or mr ds finest turn either but its fun frothy and ready to gobble up
Apr 5 2010,positive,i love choclate and it was two tumbs up

Apr 4 2010,neutral,depp reminded me of michael jackson but i guess it was alright
Apr 3 2010,positive,nice upgrade jonny depp is very versatile
Apr 3 2010,positive,edited    director tim burton brings his unique vision and sensibility to roald dahls classic childrens story in this lavish screen interpretation willy wonka johnny depp is the secretive and wildly imaginative man behind the worlds most celebrated candy company and while the wonka factory is famously closed to visitors the reclusive candy man decides to give five lucky children a chance to see the inside of his operation by placing golden tickets in five randomly selected chocolate bars charlie bucket freddie highmore whose poor but loving family lives literally in the shadow of the wonka factory is lucky enough to obtain one of the tickets and charlie escorted by his grandpa joe david kelly is in for the ride of a lifetime as he tours the strange and remarkable world of wonka with fellow winners mediaobsessed mike teavee jordan fry harsh and greedy veruca salt julia winter gluttonous augustus gloop philip wiegratz and ultracompetitive violet beauregarde annasophia robb over the course of the day some of the children will learn difficult lessons about themselves and one will go on to become wonkas new right hand charlie and the chocolate factory also stars christopher lee james fox and noah taylor the book was famously adapted to the screen before in 1971 under the title willy wonka and the chocolate factory with gene wilder as the eccentric candy tycoon     starring johnny depp freddie highmore david kelly helena bonham carter noah taylor  missi pyle  james fox  deep roy  christopher lee  adam godley  franziska troegner  annasophia robb  julia winter  jordan fry  philip wiegratz  blair dunlop  annette badland    directed by the wonderful tim burton i dont need to list down his movies since they are so many and you already know him    nominated for 1 oscar best costume design    i seriously dont remember how many times i have seen this movie i have no idea why people dont like it so much people literally have negative things about this movie but i really like it i am quite satisfied with this film and what tim burton made it to be i may have complaints with some of his movies like alice in wonderland but this was really lovable good movie this may not be flawless but still good i havent seen the original movie and i have heard so many times that it is much more accurate to the book and also much more visually appealing    this is a very fun filled dark creepy weird musical fantasy adventure movie for kids and families that you will love to watch over and over again this is one of tims best i loved the special effects though much of it was original but i like some of the effects also the costumes make up was good art direction and cinematography was spectacular songs werent memorable but score was good    johnny depp as willy wonka may not be very likable to me but he was just fun i am not gonna criticize or say bad things about his performance but it wasnt impressive he looked good and did a fine job but it just was not working for me though i like to see him in these kind of parts freddie highmore was really good and lovable he gave a nice performance other children were nice too every actor did a fine job and i liked how tim showed each and every characters    plot is nice and screenplay have bit of weak points but its very visually appealing and quite adventures not very fast paced or something    story is about this child charlie bucket who is very poor and everything willy wonka who has this biggest chocolate factory arranges a visit of 5 random children who find these 5 golden tickets and will visit his factory charlies luck is very strong since he out of nowhere accidently finds one they visit this factory but the bad and disobeying children one by one faces certain consequences and the end one will receive a special prize and the story goes on    movie is funny and very silly too but that makes it so good not a classic but a good movie to watch

Mar 20 2010,positive,enjoyable and certainly a dark visual feast johnny depp is suitably creepy but i still prefer gene wilder who was at times just terrifying i dont think tim burtons additions to the story really worked and i think the film would have been better without resolving the ambiguity about the fate of the children but there are many good moments and the cast is great

Mar 19 2010,positive,there was a lot of eye candy in this version and i was surprised that i preferred the gene wilder version over this one despite the trauma of being made to watch it on repeat when i was a child     i didnt much care for the digital oompasthat was just wrong and left a bad taste in my mouth i found depps charlie to be interesting though at times creepy  but wilder by far is my favorite wonka id hang in his chocolate factory any day
Mar 19 2010,positive,really love this version much closer to the story which i always appreciate  johnny deep was perfect and the usual tim burton charm was brilliant
Mar 18 2010,positive,umpa loompas give me the creaps
Mar 18 2010,negative,this movie dissapointed me and johnny depp cant hold a candle to gene wilder

Mar 18 2010,negative,i like the orignal better
Mar 17 2010,negative,it gets two stars for johnny depp
Mar 17 2010,positive,now charlie and the chocolate factory is a much beetter remake than the new recent alice in wonderland i really like how tim burton followed the original story and tweaked it a little thus still giving us a worthy story for him to tell plus he also gave us his signature by bringing his visual creation in it the atmosphere that burton brought into wonka was realisticalthough not into our world but realistic in wonkas universe if that even makes any sense once again johnny depp also delivers a solid prerformanceas the kids did too either the kids were exactly like their characters or they just did an amazing job getting their charatcers behavior just right bottom line is charlie and the chocolate factory is a worthy film to check outit has some comedy  dark comedy for the adults creativity good acting performances by some and you get treated to the weirdest creepiest at times and fun world of willy wonka
Mar 17 2010,positive,for a remake its well done film deep as usaul steels the show as a funny and realy ecteric wonka  the one thing that seperates this from the orginal is its more adult humor  ie dont touch that squrriel nuts the film its slef is typical tim burton  johnny deep movie 710
Mar 17 2010,positive,this makes me think about chocolate

Mar 12 2010,negative,just like the originalexcept it blows
Mar 12 2010,negative,the high pitch singing in this version was like nails on a chalk board and the oompa loompas all had the same face which freaked me out a bit first movie ever to give me a headache

Mar 9 2010,positive,original was more fun as a kid
Mar 9 2010,positive,tuesday march 9 2010    2005 charlie and the chocolate factory  fantasy musical    already aware that some people despised this film but because of tim burtons other work such as the bizarre mars attack ed wood and the sleepy hollow this film does exceed my expectations since i was able to look at this film as a tim burtons dark overtone version almost gothic of charlie and the chocolate factory with similar set ups to the 1971 version and cgi    the highlights for me are the scenes regarding the singing numbers by several lookalike little men who start to sing and dance everytime a mishap happens to each of the children is down right crazy strange and appealing that to me as a viewer at times cannot take my eyes off the screen     34
Mar 9 2010,positive,i like it so much it was cool and creative
Mar 9 2010,positive,this is a very good remake of a classic film this movie is good and has a little bit of a twist and it made it a bit more funny and really like movie
Mar 9 2010,positive,better than the first
Mar 8 2010,negative,why must tim burton constantly ruin classics by remaking them i cant wait until someone comes along and ruins edward scissorhands or beetlejuice ten years from now hopfully he is around to see how it feels stop making remakes and stick to your originals timothy
Mar 8 2010,positive,i do this directors movies this one though wasnt nearly as good as the original
Mar 8 2010,positive,once again tim burton and johnny depp took imagination to a whole new level
Mar 8 2010,positive,a fantastic remake of a classic depp is very adept at playing eccentric characters and wonka is no exception i love how it stuck the the essentials of the original story and didnt wander too far off the track as many remakes do
Mar 8 2010,negative,very weird film johnny depp was very strange in this one original much better
Mar 8 2010,positive,johnny is brilliant but could use something else
Mar 8 2010,positive,my rating might be biased as i love tim burton films i love this film and johnny does a fantastic representation or willy wonka with the feeling of films that burton always accomplishes so well
Mar 8 2010,positive,a funny movie touching and cute
Mar 8 2010,negative,the first one was so much better johnny depp just made it to weird
Mar 8 2010,positive,disappointing remake  wilder was so much better
Mar 8 2010,positive,good not as good as the original but better than i had expected
Mar 8 2010,positive,this is a very cute fun movie charlie freddie highmore is adorable the oompa loompas the factory etc are too its all loveable but i think the movie is lacking darkness i know willy wonka is set up to be a little creepy underneath the cutesy stuff but to me hes just as cute especially is a child   tim burton has done an amazing job and the movie looks amazing but to me somethings missing tim burton is an amazing director and he is without a doubt my favourite maybe thats why im looking to much for details when i watch his movies i can watch them every day and look for new things  charlie and the chocolate factory is still a really good movie my favourite scenes are the ones where willy wonka looks back in time to when he was a kid and of course the oompa loompa songs  not nearly a favourite though
Mar 8 2010,negative,johnny depp scares me sometimes  in his new film alice in wonderland with all that makeup 
Mar 7 2010,positive,i loved that movie also
Mar 7 2010,positive,jean wilder was better than johnny dep
Mar 7 2010,positive,far more faithful to the source material than the original and johnny depp is perfect as willy wonka adding willys backstory was an interesting and refreshing choice freddie highmore surprises and danny elfmans score and songs are excellent as usual
Mar 7 2010,negative,i preferred the original
Mar 7 2010,negative,an ok fictional movie
Mar 7 2010,positive,better than the first one i saw
Mar 6 2010,positive,a fascinating book for children how marvellous
Mar 6 2010,positive,tim burton and johnny depp strike again in another excellent movie  this reimagination of the roald dahl story is much more fantastical than the first something which works brilliantly and all the charcters in the film seem to fit into the environment perfectly  depp acts superbly and brings a new dimension to the willy wonka character  and the oompa loompas are excellent altogether an excellent film
Mar 6 2010,positive,i initially did not want to see this because i really didnt care much about the original that would have been a mistake im sure there are some people who prefer the original but i liked this a lot better johnny depp brings a creepiness factor along with unexpected sympathy
Mar 6 2010,neutral,is a good movie but i like the old one better
Mar 6 2010,positive,great for kids and young teenagers
Mar 6 2010,positive,chocolate makes me hungry for some more

Mar 5 2010,positive,this is so wonderful movie
Mar 4 2010,negative,funny but creepy at the same time
Mar 4 2010,negative,the first one was best
Mar 4 2010,positive,i love it but the original is best
Mar 4 2010,positive,i like the old version best
Mar 4 2010,positive,charlie and the chocolate factory signifies tim burtons return to form after a slew of lackluster efforts here he once again joins forces with johnny depp to create another masterpiece an accomplishment that i argue stands head and shoulders above the gene wilder classic not only does the film make more sense than the 1971 version but it features a much richer and funnier screenplay a wackier wonka richer colors and loads of awesome burton style
Mar 4 2010,positive,johnny depp looks scary
Mar 4 2010,positive,inevitably comparisons are going to be made to the much beloved willy wonka film starring gene wilder but each should be viewed on its own tim burton has proven to be somewhat divisive with his films and this film carries much of his trademark oddity as adaptations go it follows a bit more accurately to the novel than the first film adaptation though im sure most recall seeing the film version first good production values crazy sights and unfortunately lackluster songs populate the film but on the whole it works segments are kept short and if you dislike a part it moves rather quickly to the next sequence overall it deserves a viewing though you can probably tell if you will enjoy it if youve seen burtons other films
Mar 4 2010,positive,i love the chocolate waterfall
Mar 3 2010,positive,the original was better
Mar 3 2010,positive,want some chocolate

Feb 28 2010,positive,the old one was better
Feb 28 2010,positive,edited    director tim burton brings his unique vision and sensibility to roald dahls classic childrens story in this lavish screen interpretation willy wonka johnny depp is the secretive and wildly imaginative man behind the worlds most celebrated candy company and while the wonka factory is famously closed to visitors the reclusive candy man decides to give five lucky children a chance to see the inside of his operation by placing golden tickets in five randomly selected chocolate bars charlie bucket freddie highmore whose poor but loving family lives literally in the shadow of the wonka factory is lucky enough to obtain one of the tickets and charlie escorted by his grandpa joe david kelly is in for the ride of a lifetime as he tours the strange and remarkable world of wonka with fellow winners mediaobsessed mike teavee jordan fry harsh and greedy veruca salt julia winter gluttonous augustus gloop philip wiegratz and ultracompetitive violet beauregarde annasophia robb over the course of the day some of the children will learn difficult lessons about themselves and one will go on to become wonkas new right hand charlie and the chocolate factory also stars christopher lee james fox and noah taylor the book was famously adapted to the screen before in 1971 under the title willy wonka and the chocolate factory with gene wilder as the eccentric candy tycoon     starring johnny depp freddie highmore david kelly helena bonham carter noah taylor  missi pyle  james fox  deep roy  christopher lee  adam godley  franziska troegner  annasophia robb  julia winter  jordan fry  philip wiegratz  blair dunlop  annette badland    directed by the wonderful tim burton i dont need to list down his movies since they are so many and you already know him    nominated for 1 oscar best costume design    i seriously dont remember how many times i have seen this movie i have no idea why people dont like it so much people literally have negative things about this movie but i really like it i am quite satisfied with this film and what tim burton made it to be i may have complaints with some of his movies like alice in wonderland but this was really lovable good movie this may not be flawless but still good i havent seen the original movie and i have heard so many times that it is much more accurate to the book and also much more visually appealing    this is a very fun filled dark creepy weird musical fantasy adventure movie for kids and families that you will love to watch over and over again this is one of tims best i loved the special effects though much of it was original but i like some of the effects also the costumes make up was good art direction and cinematography was spectacular songs werent memorable but score was good    johnny depp as willy wonka may not be very likable to me but he was just fun i am not gonna criticize or say bad things about his performance but it wasnt impressive he looked good and did a fine job but it just was not working for me though i like to see him in these kind of parts freddie highmore was really good and lovable he gave a nice performance other children were nice too every actor did a fine job and i liked how tim showed each and every characters    plot is nice and screenplay have bit of weak points but its very visually appealing and quite adventures not very fast paced or something    story is about this child charlie bucket who is very poor and everything willy wonka who has this biggest chocolate factory arranges a visit of 5 random children who find these 5 golden tickets and will visit his factory charlies luck is very strong since he out of nowhere accidently finds one they visit this factory but the bad and disobeying children one by one faces certain consequences and the end one will receive a special prize and the story goes on    movie is funny and very silly too but that makes it so good not a classic but a good movie to watch

Feb 28 2010,positive,love it i love all tim burton films

Feb 27 2010,positive,better than the original
Feb 27 2010,neutral,i love the chocolate so i like the flim also

Feb 26 2010,positive,i was surprised that tim burton was doing an adaptation of the roald dahl book and it actually turned out to be pretty good the things i liked about it was that it did stay true to the book and the visuals were pretty amazing at times especially the pipe scene whan augustus gloop gets stuck in there however the songs werent that great nor as good as the original and i liked the cast but johnney depp didnt look that great instead he acts kinda like a weirdo but overall this is still a great adaptaion of the book and also worth watching it
Feb 26 2010,positive,of course this sell off it has in chocloate
Feb 26 2010,positive,great burton film often overlooked
Feb 26 2010,positive,being a huge fan of johnny depp and his  personalities i really liked this film mainly because depp stole the entire show i still love the original especially its musical numbers and it being my childhood another thing i liked was the style which i call burton style just as i love depp i love many of tim burtons films but just to clarify i dont think the original was actually remade more like burton actually kept to the original novel unlike the former which didnt quite impress the author of the entire thing   ronald dahl same novel different plot turn

Feb 11 2010,positive,this movie isnt so terriblemore like the book only thing i dont like is the oompa loompa songshorrible other than that i like it but i still like the original more
Feb 11 2010,negative,it is a movie that is full of lifes lessona and values such as honesty and humility
Feb 11 2010,positive,charlie and the chocalate factory was one of few movies i looked forward for in 2005 both because ronald dahl who is a fantastic author and understands completely what family movies ought to be they should connect to you and because three geniuses come together here and put their power together once more tim burton danny elfman and johnny depp with this delicious recipe nothing could go wrong and nothing did    this story couldnt be more right for tim burton she has a warm core that he knows how t exploit and also this entertaining weirdness that can both be sour and dark either way the director has shown that he can put this story on a movie screen brilliantly    i have never understood why the gene wilder 1971 version has always been considered a classic personally i thought she was charmless slow and not very memorable the style was non existent and the music was very imperfect     this film that i choose to call an a improved edition is most likely how dahl wanted it to be like the look and style are both great the music is obviously great i am a huge fan of danny elfman  there were obviously different opinions on the songs but i really digg them     johnny kept doing what he does best and that his being wonderful and what a role this guy has been on for the last 6 years he completely fits into the character willy wonka and gives that character sense of deepness with only his facial expressions and completely crazy and plain creepy signs in his behaviour most interesting being his hidden despise of kids freddy highmore also in finding neverland with jd  does his part greatly the other kids were also wonderful with their smaller roles christopher lee is also unforgettable in his small part    what i like most about charlie and the chocolate factory is the spirit behind it the message is positive and shoots at both good and bad children upbringing the drama is low key and never to much there i mean the last minutes in other hands that could have easily given you diabetes    as a movie lover im really satisfied with this tim burton production and also just as a regular movie goer i enjoy seeing this good family film that is also for the adults    810  good story entertaining music brilliant acting and amazing style to sum up great fun for everyone

Feb 8 2010,positive,johnny depp is the best hes also my favorite
Feb 8 2010,negative,all i can say that there can be no human alive who could possibly like this version over the original version with gene wilder i actually liked the movie up until johnny depp appeared from there on it was terrible and cheesy and im so glad it didnt surpasss two hours because then i would have knocked myself unconscious so i wouldnt have to watch anymore of it i still have total respect for tim burton and johnny depp still though they are still very talented but they took their talents way overthetop here    first of all willy wonka shouldnt look like he is a 30 year old transvestite next willy wonka is supposed to be an intelligent human being johnny depp plays him like a stupid 13 year old punk kid i didnt believe for a second he was some kind of genius willy wonka in this movie also wasnt funny nor very likeable just weird and creepy there were zero funny moments gene wilders performance on the other hand is fantastic he captures oddness with humor and intelligence the oompa loompas songs were simply unbearable and completely forgettable while the original actually had great memorable songs and werent typical bubblegum trash like this film had    the kid cast in this film was actually pretty good all the kids were excellent and did a great job in this film the parents in this film were pretty annoying though and they were very cheesy compared to the parents in the original film i also hated how they only had one actor to play all of the oompa loompas and made zero effort to use multiple actors yeah i really didnt like the ugly orange men in the original but i hated the aztec warriors in this film all played by the same actor    to sum it all up its one of the worst films ive ever seen its more true to the source material but the execution is just horrific and is just a disgrace to the book compared to the first movie im aware dahl hated the original but im sure he would hate this version because i doubt he pictured willy wonka as someone out of the rocky horror picture show

Feb 7 2010,positive,this film is so corney it is unbelievable but it is also absolutely hilarious and entertaining how ever silly the effects are tim burton has got something perfect in every aspect and somehow made it better who ever made the casting of johnny depp as willy wonka is a genius he blows the rest of the cast away and with those silly little humourous moments eg flags of the world museum this has made a really good film the only down side is charlie himself

Feb 1 2010,neutral,prepare the original
Feb 1 2010,positive,not great but a nicely done remake
Feb 1 2010,negative,charlie and the chocolate factory is an interesting remake in general i like tim burton and johnny depp is usually a very charming actor but i do not believe he was right for the role of willy wonka  i always found this portrayal of willy wonka to be closer to a portrayal of michael jackson i kind of get the feeling that willy wonka is an asocial pedophelic slightly retarded fellow rather than a mysterious quirky wise character that was a huge drawback  another portrayal i didnt like was the character of charlie i felt like the filmmakers were trying too hard to make this guy seem perfect and hes not suppose to seem that way  the songs were another down side they were okay i guess but they werent memorable or catchy in fact a few were relatively annoying i couldnt get into them  ill give this movie props for the art direction this of course is the high point of all of burtons films they made the movie look dark and mysterious which is a feeling were suppose to have but dont get anywhere else in the film  all in all this movie tried to be more weird than anything else and it just didnt quite succeed to tell a good story i cant say its terrible but its still bad and i still hate it especially for its portrayal of the two leads charlie and willy wonka  410

Jan 31 2010,negative,not as good as the original
Jan 31 2010,positive,if you are a real fan of johnny depp you must have seen this film the story is written by roald dahl about a boy called charlie who lives with his two parents and four grandparents in a crooked house he finds a golden ticket which was wrapped inside a delicious wonka chocolate bar there are only five golden tickets and five lucky kids may visit wonkaâs chocolate factory with an adult in the end one of them may even win a special price   johnny depp plays the strange owner of the factory willy wonka depp is absolutely suitable for this role especially in combination with the wellknown director tim burton the film is extremely funny for people of all ages even though the book is meant for children watching this film makes you want to run to the kitchen and grab whatever candy you can find if youâre not such a sweet toothed person youâll probably love the oompaloompaâs these little creatures work in the factory and if you donât like them either then i donât know whatâs wrong with you compared to the older film they both have their charm but i prefer the newest  as a chocoholic and admirer of johnny depp i can absolutely recommend this film to you itâs extremely funny itâs mouthwatering and with its happy ending you wish the same will happen to you but let me give me you one advice before you go watch this crazy film make sure you have a bar of chocolate within reach

Jan 30 2010,neutral,johnny depp scared me with his impersonation of willy wonka the only really good thing about this movie unlike its predacessor back in the 1970s it shows why mr wonka went into the business of candy making it was oddly done along with its predacessor and the cast was rightmaybe not the director

Jan 16 2010,positive,in spite of johnny depp channeling michael jackson with his performance as willy wonka tim burton has created another wonderfully entertaining picture that is visually phenomenal and expectedly absurd i also found it refreshing to see that the film remains very faithful to roald dahls fantastic story unlike the 70s adaption which also has its own charming merits

Jan 6 2010,positive,like most i preferred the original i guess it wouldve been fairly pointless redoing it like before but im not sure tim burtons style is particularly sympathetic to the story and as good as jonny depp is at subverting the character the whole thing just lacks the warmth that made it classic in the first place

Dec 30 2009,positive,this movie stayed closer to the book than charlie and the chocolate factory tim burton does a great job of expressing the weirdness that is willie wonka

Dec 28 2009,negative,remake come on quit the doovers already
Dec 28 2009,positive,after viewing this im still conflicted as to which version i prefer tim burton or the earlier work while the earlier version is a classic one that i grew up on as a child and have fond memories of however burtons version is more faithful to the source material and he has a slightly darker tone to it which i like either way johnny deep is brilliant and almost unrecognizable as willy wonka he is awkward strange and odd all at the same time burtons version also has a more whimsical fee and tone to it i think that i like both versions equally
Dec 28 2009,negative,prefer the old version

Dec 27 2009,negative,charlie and the chocolate factory failed to bring any entertainment value to me i thought that this was going to be at least worth a watch but i was way wrong
Dec 27 2009,positive,tim burton did a better job of conveying the hidden malice under willie wonkas skin  its closer to the book version despite loving the 1970s version with gene wilder i think the tim burton version is superior and the music is better too
Dec 27 2009,negative,terrible remake but burton brings a dark much needed element to this epic story

Dec 25 2009,positive,great johnny depp movie
Dec 25 2009,positive,my favourite movie willy wonka 3
Dec 25 2009,positive,jonny depp say no more great
Dec 25 2009,positive,do you think about this movie when you open a bar of chocolate i dont    which is not to say this is the worst movie i have seen it is in fact acceptable in quality    the visuals are excellent it feels like you have been transported to a factory outside a slum in the slum etc which is nice of director tim burton the infamous tunnel scene has also been done nicely    the songs are hit and miss the songs are either catchy or fun but definitely not both especially the wonka theme shudders    my biggest miss is the story and acting which brought this movie down to 60 the updates on the kids are nice and funny but never explored muchunlike the character dimensions that already exist     the charlie is extremely bland he wants to only help his family which is fine but the portrayal is dismal visually and even more so verbally    johhny depp plays a decent willy wonka but it does not hold up to gene wilders portrayal from the earlier version because while whimsically playful like womka should have been wilders only flaw in his performance present but not as obvious he seems a little shallow    overall it is an okay film adequate not good not bad like chocolate coming from a gambler it can be sweet or bland
Dec 25 2009,negative,no no no no la la la la im not listening seriously if your going to remake a classic please for the love of all thats holy dont butcher it

Dec 17 2009,negative,this one sucked original was awesome
Dec 17 2009,positive,a brilliant taste of family fun something burton is not known for while many slam this with bad reviews comparing it with the book and its first feature film tim essentially gave it emotion no character not even wonka deserves to not be understood depps charm and interaction with the children gave this movie a top notch family good feel burton cannot be stopped as a sensationally imaginative movie maker
Dec 16 2009,positive,this is about the children who are so very greedy about chocolates a lesson learned
Dec 16 2009,negative,willy wonka good morning starshine the earth says hello    all i can say that there can be no human alive who could possibly like this version over the original version with gene wilder i actually liked the movie up until johnny depp appeared from there on it was terrible and i couldnt wait for the movie to be over im glad it didnt exceed over two hours otheriwse i would have stabbed my eyes out just so i wouldnt have to watch anymore of it    first willy wonka shouldnt look like he is a 30 year old transvestite  next willy wonka is supposed to be a genius johnny depp plays him like a stupid eight year old kid i dont believe for a second he is some kind of genius willy wonka is neither a likable or a funny character in this crap film he is just weird and creepier than anything else depp has done there were very few funny moments     gene wilders performance on the other hand is fantastic he captures oddness with humor and intelligence the oompa loompas songs were simply unbearablejust awful while the original actually had original songs this film had typical bubblegum trash i also couldnt stand the fact that they only used one freaking actor to play every oompa loompa thats literally got to be the laziest casting ive ever seen yeah i wasnt too fond of the ugly orange men in the original but i hated the aztec warriors here    overall i hated hated hated this movie im aware that this remake is closer to the source material than the original im also aware that roald dahl hated the original but im sure he would hate this one too because i highly doubt he imagined willy wonka like he just got back from doing the rocky horror picture show
Dec 16 2009,positive,doesnt quite have the touch that willie wonka and the chocolate factory had gene wilder had nailed that role and made it his own something johnny depp couldnt do
Dec 16 2009,negative,i like most of johnny depps movies just not this one even though this is not a remake of willy wonka and the chocolate factory i still think willy wonka and the chocolate factory is way better
Dec 16 2009,positive,hard to compete with the original but this version held its own
Dec 15 2009,negative,johnny depp is a great actor but just couldnt turn this movie around dont get me wrong it is a great family film but a little too colourful and mr willy wonka seemed evil in this film with his quiet snickers and they way he picks on little kids  johnny should stick to bigger action movie
Dec 15 2009,negative,did not enjoy this nearly as much as the original gene wilder was more subtle with his darkness but this is still an enjoyable movie
Dec 15 2009,negative,seen the original and this there ok i guess but bit borin 2 watch them more than 1

Dec 11 2009,positive,many people hate this film for the same reason i enjoy it too many people compare this chocolate factory movie with the other one truth be told the two exist on a spectrum where those who despised the first found what they were missing as did those who were satisfied with the first found this lacking one could say this is a failed attempt though i was unhappy with the first so id have to give it at least one thumb up
Dec 11 2009,positive,ooompa loompa doompa di do if u think twice u will listen to me hahah lol they r small but cute
Dec 10 2009,positive,i cant believe that was johnny depp

Dec 10 2009,negative,cant compare to the first even though i am a fan of depp
Dec 10 2009,positive,everything you would expect form a tim burton movie
Dec 9 2009,neutral,this follows the book better than the dirst but the first was better acting and more magical in this one willy wonka justa creeps u out and poor acting hurts
Dec 9 2009,positive,i dont think i like depps portrayal of willy wonka more than wylders but hes certainly fun to watch  remakes or reimaginings are pretty tough to pull off but tim burton manages to pull it off with enough originality to make this trip to the chocolate factory worth a second visit
Dec 9 2009,positive,johnny depps performance as the eccentric innocent and slightly creepy willy wonka is what provides this tim burton reimagining the necessary ingredients for a solid remake this film is much darker and true to the original ronald dahl novel the children are portrayed much closer to the way they were in the novel the special effects were breathtaking the oompaloompas are played by one actor which is a bit distracting but the songs are so catchy and this film is so enjoyable that it doesnt seem to matter as the film progresses this film has a lot more heart than meets the eye wonkas character has a great origin sequence that shows how he was treated poorly as a kid and he is really a lonely man who wants his childhood back this is a very fun film for the entire family
Dec 9 2009,positive,one of my favourite musicals that was very much like the book if you ignore the flashbacks with willys  dad
Dec 9 2009,positive,enjoyed both versions
Dec 9 2009,positive,johnny depp is very remarkable
Dec 8 2009,positive,way better than 1st in my opinion

Dec 8 2009,negative,this was ok but not as good as the original
Dec 8 2009,positive,charlie and the chocolate factory is not only beautiful for the eye with all the beautiful things you see but also deals with daddy issues if you watch it very carefully you can see without even knowing this movie is created by tim burton in charlie and the chocolate factory he made willie lonely isolated from his family in edward scissorhands he made edward lonely and isolated from the entire world he makes us feel connected to this characters by making them different but still human he makes willie a crazy extraordinary man but he still is human he makes edward a machine but gives him the power to have human feelings you should watch this movie for sure

Nov 30 2009,positive,tim burtons adaptation of willy wonka and the chocolate factory begins in a promising fashion but ultimately falls dull due to its predictable climax although delivering a unique and magical ending the original masterpiece still remains the far superior of the two as expected johnny depp gives a wonderful performance however but i wasnt expecting anything less from him

Nov 20 2009,negative,although johnny depp is delightful he cant make up for this poor excuse of a remake everything is forced and it seems to me that there is no real sense of magic and mystery  apart from what the hell depp was wearing seriously watch the original instead
Nov 20 2009,negative,am i the only person that wonders if johnny depp is having an affair with tim burton

Nov 19 2009,positive,i liked the original better
Nov 19 2009,positive,quite frankly people can hat tim burtons charlie and the chocolate factory all they want i still love it and think its practically flawless not only is this much more of an accurate adaption of the book but its just visually amazing the fact that its so childlike and eerily bonkers is what makes all the slight jokes and offhand comments by the characters even more funny and effective johnny depps willy wonka is all kinds of crazy and makes for a believable candy inventor with the brain of a tenyearold boy what i like is that hes almost nothing like gene wilders interpretation so theres no sense in comparing the two johnny depps performance takes everything youd expect from the character and completely levels it its one of the strangest attempts at a human being ever put on screen i think all of the back story they give for willy wonka and his oompa loompas is a wise decision honestly its pretty hilarious when you know more about the two i think the child actors in this are next to perfect theyre exaggerations of reality for sure but at not one point does anyone seem fake or overacted the music is the final straw in making this a bonafide classic it channels madness into song and dance in the end theres no reason anyone should find tim burtons version bad in any way hes a visionary director that never seems to disappoint in terms of giving a visual landscape that is totally original and something out of a dream
Nov 19 2009,positive,always have been a huge fansince i was little
Nov 18 2009,positive,i love this movie so

Nov 13 2009,positive,far better than i expected
Nov 13 2009,positive,charlie and the chocolate factory i thought was way better than original one  i usually dont care for johnny depp  i thought he did a hell of  a job playing willy wonka
Nov 13 2009,negative,even johnny cant make me sit through this one

Nov 11 2009,negative,did not like this versionthought it was more scary than anything give me the old school version any day
Nov 10 2009,negative,even if johnny depp wasnt horribly miscast theres probably no actor capable of matching gene wilders magically odd performance this one waters down the whole guarded trust subtext and subsequently the heart of the original
Nov 10 2009,positive,apparently dahl roald liked this version more than the original because of the accuracy i agree however the chocolate river scene and all the characters on a cgi ship hated it
Nov 10 2009,positive,ok what we have here is something that is not as bad as i would like to say what i mean is that eventhough i want to tell myself its not good for some reason i like and enjoy it but anyway its a tim burton movie and you can tell it starting with the principal two characters as many of burtons protagonists resemble from one another in many ways the background and scenery gave it that special look it needed and the danny elfman soundtrack is very fitting but what i have to remark in this movie is by far johnny depps acting he is so talented he can make just about any kind of character specially if it has some strange manners and weird obsessions and thats the main highlight of the film i would have liked more screen time from christopher lee also but that wasnt needed so much for the story and its something extra    to end with it  i gotta say i prefer the first adaptation but this one is just entertaining and willy wonka is hell of a character gotta love him for sure stating once again that the burtondepp team knows how to rock the house
Nov 10 2009,negative,not anywhere good as the original

Nov 8 2009,positive,johnny depp i love it
Nov 8 2009,negative,i didnt really like this remake i remember the original willy wonka  the chocolate factory as not being so gloomy and frightening this version appears too cheesy and with way too much obvious imitation i believe tim burton should stick to making movies like beetlejuice if he wants to keep the dark side aspect live
Nov 7 2009,negative,hated it its sucked big time
Nov 7 2009,positive,johnny does his thing again puts a dark twist to the story but done well

Nov 6 2009,positive,i love johnny depp bt his acting in this movie wasnt so sweet bt his factory was 
Nov 6 2009,positive,now i have to get one thing out of the way i dont like the original movie i just dont it didnt make me feel like i needed to care about it at all that being said i really enjoy this movie    the styles in this movie are told in classic burton style dark textures meet bright colors and lights i felt as if i was reading the book all over again told in roald dahls perspective    speaking of the book i also like how they stuck closer to the book in this movie this made me think that the filmmakers really truly respected mr dahls work as much as he did himself    the actings okay its not good not bad just okay especailly johnny depps performance of willy wonka he was crazy and just plain out bizare to watch in the theatre and at home    but other than that i like the movie a lot its not perfect but still really good
Nov 6 2009,positive,being a fan of the original i didnt particularly like johnny depps performance as willy wonka but then again wonka was supposed to be weird and quirky so i suppose to another you can say he did a great job the visuals were brilliant yet at times like how they only used one actor as an oompa loompa green screened over and over it didnt look all that believable i personally like how they expanded to show how wonka met the oompa loompas as well as make the oompa loompa songs their own yet at first i had mixed feelings about the new songs but as it progressed i found it pretty cool the ending to this version really helped the remake out for me because it contains a much more satisfying ending than the original although when it comes down to it the original is the ultimate victor here
Nov 6 2009,positive,a great family filmjohny depp is just hilarious in his role as willy wonka
Nov 5 2009,neutral,didnt really like this much
Nov 5 2009,negative,tim burton let me down a bit on this one he is one of my favourite directors yet i cant help but feel this movie is trying too hard to be modern and instead just comes off headache inducing i think this could have done a little better without being in the shadow of the gene wilder version
Nov 5 2009,positive,omg i hate this movie
Nov 5 2009,negative,original much better why remake

Nov 3 2009,positive,this movie is decent but it has some problems     theres some weirdness like chewing gum that has a 3 course dinner packed within it and willy wonka is even more weird in this movie he seems like he hates bad spoiled children and who could blame him i hate those kinds of people too     the oompaloompa songs are not as good as the ones in willy wonka and the chocloate factory its okay to say the least     willy wonka has a weird looking haircut that looks similar to the one that the ugly female russian villain had from indiana jones 4     willy wonka had braces     willy wonka has to read cards to explain things some things maybe because he forgets what he is supposed to say to his consumers which are the kids and their parents     the acting was ok but couldve been better      theres not enough comedy in it      this movie is decent despite its issues its not as good as   willy wonka and the chocloate factory but its fun to watch its not a must see movie but i enjoyed it for what it was which was flawed and fun 810

Oct 21 2009,positive,in 2004 when someone said willy wonka the first thought that popped into your head generally wasnt michael jackson in 2005 thats exactly what you thought of this catcf was sick twisted and demented however it was in the tim burton style so the twisted aspect almost had a cartoonish air to it  it was sort of entertaining and a new twist on the story of catcf however the michael jackson willy wonka come on why dont you just shoot snoopy same idea really killing childhood memories we all grew up with gene wilder as ww and we loved it this killed it i feel that johnny depp is capable of more than this willy wonka is supposed to be this sort of older wise and intelligent man who is teaching brats a lesson however this willy wonka almost seemed like a sadistic 4 year old who decided it would be funny to play some pranks on unsuspecting but still bratty children and then tear the remaining child away from his family forever i will say that  this definitely had the tim burton touch to it it was entertaining but that failed to make it a real quality film in the end i sort of feel that it wasnt good that they revealed his back story i feel that when you give a character like that a back story they lose some of the mystique but as it is they did a decent job with it i really liked christopher lee in this film i also applaud the work of deep roy who had to play all of the oompa loompas and  thus had to do every dance movie thousands of times it was a sort of decent film but not really gene wilders willy wonka will still be around in 50 years this one will not      trivia time 1 they had a long and hard time trying to cast this film here are some of their choicescontenders for some of the roles    willy wonka steve martin robin williams christopher walken nicolas cage will smith brad pitt mike myers ben stiller the rock bill murray leslie nielsen patrick stewart john cleese eric idle michael palin rowan atkinson robert de niro michael keaton and marilyn manson     my pick robin williams    grandpa joe richard attenborough kirk douglas albert finney richard griffiths anthony hopkins armin muellerstahl paul newman max von sydow  david warner and christopher lloyd also gregory peck and peter ustinov were approached but both died before they could answer gregory pecks family said he only told them that hed consider it as he didnt want to seem desperate and take a big pay cut he was really looking forward to playing grandpa joe     my pick either albert finney richard attenborough or max von sydow anthony hopkins would be interesting too though    mr teevee tim allen dan castellaneta james belushi bob saget kurtwood smith ray romano and ed oneill all famous for playing tv dads     my pick im not sure about this one      2 some of the buttons in the glass elevator  incompetent fools  tbone steak jello  secretarial poodles  cocoa cats  mechanical clouds  stars in their pies  nice plums  up and out  fragile egos  black box of frogs  weird lollipops  mighty jam monitor  creative dog flip  elastic forest  leaky canes  dessert island  people poo  pie cream  spewed vegetables  naffy taffy  lickety split peas  honeycombs and brushes  old sneezes and smells dept  spewed dumplings  television room  whizzdoodles  chocolate lip rookies  blackberry sausages  yankee doodles  orange egg flip  root beer goggles  pastry room  heart shaped lungs  projection room     3 near the beginning of the movie charlies dad is shown to be working at a factory producing toothpaste with the brand name smilex smylex is the brand name of the poisonous gas used by the joker in batman another tim burton film

Oct 20 2009,neutral,if it isnt broke dont fix it oh johnny what are you doing in this you are like some creepy pedo person who is totally out of it while the story sticks closer to the source material and danny elfmans songs from the book are rather catchy my mind cant forget those classics from the original also the effects make the chocolate river look way more realistic personally id give it a watch once but at the end of the day give this on a stick and watch the original

Oct 20 2009,positive,tim burton is a master at constructing brilliant and unique films that boggle the mind and defy all beliefs there films that deliver a bold new twist each time but what makes burton a master is his attention and devotion to his story the detail and meticulous design of the sets the costumes the atmosphere of his films and how they all in some  strange way  impart a certain message of sorts   that  has a  bizarre connection to real life  tim burtons 2005 adaptation of roald dahls   beloved children book charlie and the chocolate factory has a method to its madness and a meaning to its story charlie and the chocolate factory is one of burtons best films since big fish and sleepy hollow      tim burtons take on the legendary tale of  eccentric chocolate maker  willy wonka and  young dreamer charlie bucket  is a  film of meticulous   design it is meant to be a children movie but  charlie and the chocolate factory plays out better as a quirky adult  fantasy adventure  with a pg rating burton doesnt spare any detail  he uses all his style  and energy  to create the bleak world of charlie bucket  and all his imagination and  light hearted enthusiasm to make the  beautiful chocolate factory of willy wonka  its astounding how it works how it moves along flawlessly  telling its story and just wowing the audience in each and every scene it is not a cheap exploitation flick with a famous name slapped on it it is a story about a person a place and a situation that comes to be fall that person freddie highmore burton has not only updated a classic story for a modern generation he has effectively made a film that is both true to his quirky style and   mainstream enough for modern audiences its one of the best films of the last decade and also one of burtons very best      the film only works   whether you believe in what you are seeing it succeeds on   how you look at it if you look at it with a cynical point of view than this film will be a terrible time and a complete waste of money to you however if you keep your eyes open and your mind clear of any doubt than this film will work wonders on your soul your imagination and your imagination  tim burtons charlie and the chocolate factory is a one of kind film that only he burton could have come up with and executed to the peak of perfection charlie and the chocolate factory is as quirky as a burton film can be but in its defense it is also  a poignant story of love family doing the right thing not being spoiled or overly competitive and most of all chocolate lots and lots of chocolate this film is a must see for burtondepp fans and for fans how like their chocolate visually stunning and dark        johnny depp has always been know for his dark strange and engrossing performances  there is only one film that comes to mind that depp has taken a light hearted turn and that was in marc fosters biopic of famed peter pan author  jm barrie finding neverland here depp once again displays his skills as an actor he gives audiences a performance that does not come off as eerie but eccentric quirky and strange which for a burton movie that is not too had to grasp depp delivers every step of the way and he never falters for one minute in his audacious role as willy wonka freddie highmore is fantastic in this he is so honest earnest and cheerful that he lifts this film out of its dark style and brings some light into the picture highmore is very skilled and if he was taken seriously as an actor he would truly  be great and he  is highmore has all the makings of a fantastic actor and alongside deppfor the second time  he  holds his own quite nicely  and silences the doubtersme being one that he is worthy of being called an actor the rest of the cast including christopher lee david kelly noah taylor and helena bonham carter all deliver fine supporting performances in this fantastic fantasy adventure        charlie and the chocolate factory is fun wild zany outrageously enjoyable and delightful it is a film that so hugely entertaining it does not feel like you are watching a movie more as if you are living it burton has done wonders here and this film does not get as much praise as it should it is a richly layered and well thought out film that exceeds all expectations it definitely exceeded my expectations  it shows how sometimes    the thing you want the most is not always what is best for you   and how sometimes just because youre down and out doesnt mean youre any less fortunate than the next

Oct 10 2009,positive,a very colorful bright and childish movie  the way we are used to from burton depp and elfman  but this time it lacked the certain deeper sense we saw in edward scissorhands or the batman movies  nevertheless its one of burtons best and actually one of the best fantasy movies ive seen
Oct 10 2009,positive,i love the remake of this
Oct 10 2009,positive,i want to experience what charlie see in the factory
Oct 10 2009,neutral,charlie and the chocolate factory has moments of brilliance especially the flashbacks of willy wonka and his father played by christopher lee but it does have moments of dullness especially johnny depps performance as willy wonka i think johnny depp is a really great actor who plays some very amusing roles but this is probably the only movie that johnny depp has delivered a mediocre performance thats just me of course
Oct 10 2009,negative,didnt even need to be made

Oct 9 2009,negative,i like the original not the remake
Oct 9 2009,positive,depp is absolutely brilliant here again
Oct 9 2009,positive,advertised to audiences both young and old alike the universe that roald dahl created in his 1964 novel charlie and the chocolate factory has always been one of dark but affectionate humor so far there have been two noteworthy adaptations one in 1971 starring a memorably apathetic gene wilder and another in 2005 directed by tim burton and guess who plays the leading role in the latter you know the story you know the characters you know the music come with me and youll see a world of pure imagination and you know the quirkiest of scenes if you have deeply fond memories of the gene wilder version of the narrative then youll either welcome the burton take on the story with open arms or youll close the gates to your heart the proverbial factory on sight a complicated case this film we are tempted to compare it with the socalled original although at the same time burton makes it very clear that its supposed to be evaluated on its own terms instead of letting my nostalgia take over i embraced the situations and images that burton recreated rearranged and rightfully made his own hes not looking to ruin your childhood hes simply assaulting the senses in a colorful variety of ways like he always does fashionably and not without his fair share of charm and wit    lets see this is the story of a poor boy named charlie bucker freddy highmore who lives in a broken down house with his mom helena bonham carter father noah taylor and an abundance of grandfathers and grandmothers his favorite of which is grandpa joe david kelly the bucket family practically lives right next to an old chocolate factory owned by the mysterious and unseen willy wonka johnny depp who is just now  for the first time in many years so were told  opening the doors to the factory yet again but only to a limited party of five lucky people you see wonka has cleverly placed a fantastical golden ticket inside five random wonka chocolate bars and it doesnt take long before each one of them is found the lucky five include sporty violet beuregarde annasophia robb electronic addict mike teavee jordan fry bratty veruca salt julia winter chubby german boy augustus gloop philip wiegratz and charlie himself after he finds a ten dollar bill lodged in the snow by chance and  also by chance  happens upon a chocolate bar that contains the golden slip of shining paper    the kids must attend with a parent charlie chooses grandpa joe since he used to work for wonka and would like to see how the factory and the man alike have changed over the years that followed the day that many were laid off from their jobs and with that theyre off wonka gives them a personal tour around the factory and as expected the children cannot resist temptation augustus gloop falls into the chocolate river violet turns violet and blows up into a big blueberry veruca is attacked by highly intellectual squirrels an element not present in the previous adaptation instead there were golden eggs and mike teavees dream comes true when the crew visits a room in which a cool gadget can teleport chocolate bars and eventually mike into a television its all fairly predictable and routine if only because we know the story so well thanks to the gene wilder version and the source novel but burton finds a way to put his big old noggin to good use in just about every scene     while its yet another effectively strange whimsy comedy from one of hollywoods most imaginative minds this charlie and the chocolate factory is not without its hard candy its mostly a sugarcoated delight with a few bittersweet and touching moments as well as a plethora of darkly amusing comic scenarios although at times burton seems as if hell do anything for a laugh there are many things in this world that burton seems to find humorous and sometimes when he puts these things on film they work and other times they fall flat depp plays the willy wonka role convincingly but its hard to ignore the creepiness factor that is present throughout he reminds a lot of people including myself of michael jackson sometimes his onscreen attitude garners laughs that are earned and then there are brief but often painful moments in which it feels as if hes lost too much charm and thats where jokes like the one where wonka makes a weird noise with his tongue to send a verbal signal to his trusty oompa loompas all played by deep roy fall terribly flat    buti cannot ignore the craft that went into this picture allinall its more of an experience than a story although the script is nice and polished the only problem with the screenplay really is the fact that burton attempts to expand a bit too much on the ambiguous mystery that is wonkas past the good news that comes with the bad news in this case is that we get to meet wonkas father played by the legendary christopher lee case in point though this character and subplot wasnt needed nevertheless as far as experiences go this is a stimulating one danny elfmans musical score is spectacularly rhythmic and the oompa loompa songs that come up after every child is offed are great the special effects are genuinely dazzling even if the practical effects count for a lot more in the end and the tone is a nice mix of the macabre and the sentimental it might not be the best emotional sucker punch to the soul that burton has to offer but the aftertaste is suitably glorious making it a rather recommended viewing
Oct 9 2009,negative,i liked the original more
Oct 9 2009,negative,preferred the original
Oct 9 2009,positive,not really my type a pretty alright at that
Oct 9 2009,positive,great for all ages i loved it
Oct 9 2009,positive,i like this movie
Oct 9 2009,positive,dis one is my favouritrhp u get itul neva gt tired of it
Oct 8 2009,positive,because so much in tim burtons films stems from his vivid imagination his films are highly personal lovehate affairs if you love one first time round youll want to see it again along with everything else hes made if you hate it or are simply bored by it youll resist seeing the film a second time but in the case of charlie and the chocolate factory a second viewing could just be the key to appreciating it and  perhaps more importantly  understanding what makes burton so magical    comparisons were obviously going to be drawn between this and the 1971 adaptation starring gene wilder the first version made several changes from the book like making the oompa loompas orange rather than pygmies and was famously disowned by roald dahl himself this version remained in development hell for over a decade while various directors screenplays and leading men were presented to the dahl estate and all of them were refused    its therefore a given that with the dahl estate on board this adaptation is the closest possible to the original story fans of the book will revel in the casting of the child actors and freddie highmore in particular who are wellaccomplished and seem born to play their characters some liberties are taken of course but unlike the earlier version they by and large compliment the narrative the dark backstory with willy wonkas father being a dentist who forbids him from eating chocolate works because it broadens out the character of wonka it prevents him from being just another english eccentric and with the new denouement of the film we actually start to sympathise with him rather than simply finding him a little freaky    when it comes to wonka himself there is noone better to play him than johnny depp for all of wilders charm and comic ability depp manages to tap into the nub of wonkas demons vocalising them in that voice which is alternately jittery and flamboyant and in a physical manner which is both creepy and charming comparisons with michael jackson however are barking up the wrong tree depps portrayal is by his own admission closer in character to that of howard hughes his wonka like hughes is a man with a singular love a love to which he has dedicated his life and which threatens to consume him now he is ageing    there are fine performances through the rest of the adult cast noah taylor still most famous for his cameo in vanilla sky is convincing as charlies father while helena bonham carter is reigned in by her fiancée to give a subtle turn as the mother david kelly and liz smith are entertaining as two of the grandparents and missi pyle is the most interesting and appealing of the spoilt childrens parents and of course one must not overlook the deadpan deep roy as every single one of the oompaloompas     if there is a flaw with charlie and the chocolate factory it is that there is so much visual delight so much going on on the surface that the viewer may start to grow suspicious that there is nothing underneath the rich and camp colour scheme  which make the factory look like the jokers lair  is so overpowering that it threatens to obscure the moral points of the film burton is therefore wise to include enough scenes and snippets of dialogue to bolster the films warnings against excess and selfishness whether in the invasion of the stores to find the golden tickets or the piquant oneliners emanating from the children this film has its eyes on the prize  so much so that we even forgive burton for the highly sentimental last line    the only other flaw with this film is the songs burtons close relationship with danny elfman has led some critics to believe that all of his films are essentially musicals sure enough elfman serves up another captivating score over the excellent opening credits but the puppet scene upon entering the factory grounds manages to be downright toecurling and while the oompaloompas sing lyrics written by dahl himself they are produced and processed in such a way that we cannot understand them its like dressing the teletubbies in bondage gear and watching them through a kaleidoscope    for all these little flaws charlie and the chocolate factory remains one of burtons best films like batman returns and sleepy hollow before it the niggling little flaws in either the script or the execution of certain scenes are more than compensated for by the overall quality the result is a visual delight with a deep moral root a charming childrens story which marries the darkness of dahls original to the gothic majesty that burton has been honing since beetlejuice on first viewing the visuals and altered ending may throw you off but by persevering and revisiting disappointment can be avoided

Sep 28 2009,negative,original one was better
Sep 28 2009,positive,the duo of burton and depp have done it again with this one  burton creates a magical and surreal world that captured my imagination and made me want to take a trip through willy wonkas incredible factory  watching the child contestants fail willys test thanks to their flaws was very poetic and funny  i particularly enjoyed depp as willy wonka  he came across as a little creepy every once in a while but made up for it by being so quirky and interesting  seeing how he grew up and watching him try to reconnect with his father was a very welcomed addition to this remake  the movie also succeeds in showing how important family can be  charlie grew up in severe poverty when compared to the other contestants but thanks to his familys teachings and support he had what it took to win the factory  hes not rich financially but its never really bothered him thanks to his family
Sep 28 2009,negative,five star for the first one

Sep 27 2009,negative,i never thought jd could annoy the hell out of me until i saw this crap movie
Sep 27 2009,negative,props to tim burton but you cant beat the original plus i despised johnny depp in this movie and thats hard for me to say because hes usually one of my favorite actors visuals were wonderful plot was more about wonka and thus it brought the more serious side of the story to light and the way the movie was put together sort of separated it from the original all together    thats the main problem though i loved the original so much that i ended up disliking this version even more than i should     to those whove never seen the original which is hard for me to imagine but still i would not recommend this to you however if youve seen the original and havent seen this just watch it to watch it because i fully advocate remakes of timeless classics     i just dont understand why lots of people thoroughly enjoy this movie so much it didnt leave an impression on me actually i forgot about it for a long time until recently rewatching it
Sep 27 2009,positive,good work on the movie but i didnt like the demented character or mr wonka the best part of the movie was johnny depps smooth skinhehe

Sep 21 2009,negative,all style but with very sour substance tim burtons charlie and the chocolate factory delivers plenty of visual flair at the risk of adding in an excessive amount of unnecessary material simultaneously straying away from the points made by the source material and its 1971 sibling

Sep 6 2009,positive,i prefered gene wilder but this was good
Sep 6 2009,positive,i cant believe the low reviews this film has received from my friends ratings on facebook they state a remake was not needed yet this completely misses the point this is not a remake but a new interpretation of the original source material     seemingly what everyone have done is compare this to the original movie and not the original book remember dahl himself hated the original movie it deviates quite significantly from the book  charlies exploits with fizzy lifting juice being the most offensive     if you have read the book and it appears none of you have then you will realise this is a very faithful reengineering of the source material the dahl estate fully approved of this new interpretation     personally i really enjoyed this film it captures the feeling of the book including the original songs completely rewritten by the original movie     go read the book then see this

Aug 12 2009,negative,movie didnt hold my interest
Aug 12 2009,positive,very good music sounds a bit too mordern sometimes bit i guess the plasticness of the factory translates into synths in the score and oompaloompah songs    there is something about the dad working at the toothpaste factory grandpa working at candy factory wilbur wonka begina a dentist willie being a chocalateer  a sorto good vs evil but in terms of passed wars or something

Aug 7 2009,negative,because it has depp in i suppose and he all rocksbut then again i despise dahl
Aug 7 2009,negative,johnny depp trades in the beard the swag and the rum for a pasty complexion a creepy hairstyle and actually hes probably still drunk the film has its good intentions laid out neatly on the production line but due to an improper mixing of the ingredients the resulting experience is always either too bitter or much too sweet

Aug 6 2009,negative,ive always found this road dahl story to be a little odd but johnnys depps performance as willy wonka seems a little too perverse
Aug 6 2009,positive,because it envolves chocolate
Aug 6 2009,negative,some of the ideas in the movie are interesting and johnny depp provided a decent performance as wonka but why would anyone make a reboot of the classic wonka film songs sung by the oompa loompas are just horrible and not catchy the loompas themselves are not as memorable or fun as the classic ones and the environments are ok but again not as great as the classic even the story is not as great as the classic and the ending needed to be better a movie to watch once just to see the differences between the two movies and thats it
Aug 6 2009,positive,johnny deep is always perfect

Jul 24 2009,negative,at first the adaptation of charlie buckets life is realistic and a bit scarybut veering into the made up story of willy wonkas childhood is unnecessary and deflects from a good yarn  johnny depps imitation of michael jackson is so creepy that i longed for gene wilder to leap through the screen and save this ultimate bummer of a film

Jul 23 2009,positive,johnny depp is the man
Jul 23 2009,neutral,remake not as good as the 1st
Jul 23 2009,positive,tim burton is a master at constructing brilliant and unique films that boggle the mind and defy all beliefs there films that deliver a bold new twist each time but what makes burton a master is his attention and devotion to his story the detail and meticulous design of the sets the costumes the atmosphere of his films and how they all in some  strange way  impart a certain message of sorts   that  has a  bizarre connection to real life  tim burtons 2005 adaptation of roald dahls   beloved children book charlie and the chocolate factory has a method to its madness and a meaning to its story charlie and the chocolate factory is one of burtons best films since big fish and sleepy hollow              tim burtons take on the legendary tale of  eccentric chocolate maker  willy wonka and  young dreamer charlie bucket  is a  film of meticulous   design it is meant to be a children movie but  charlie and the chocolate factory plays out better as a quirky adult  fantasy adventure  with a pg rating burton doesnt spare any detail  he uses all his style  and energy  to create the bleak world of charlie bucket  and all his imagination and  light hearted enthusiasm to make the  beautiful chocolate factory of willy wonka  its astounding how it works how it moves along flawlessly  telling its story and just wowing the audience in each and every scene it is not a cheap exploitation flick with a famous name slapped on it it is a story about a person a place and a situation that comes to be fall that person freddie highmore burton has not only updated a classic story for a modern generation he has effectively made a film that is both true to his quirky style and   mainstream enough for modern audiences its one of the best films of the last decade and also one of burtons very best              the film only works   whether you believe in what you are seeing it succeeds on   how you look at it if you look at it with a cynical point of view than this film will be a terrible time and a complete waste of money to you however if you keep your eyes open and your mind clear of any doubt than this film will work wonders on your soul your imagination and your imagination  tim burtons charlie and the chocolate factoryâ is a one of kind film that only he burton could have come up with and executed to the peak of perfection charlie and the chocolate factory is as quirky as a burton film can be but in its defense it is also  a poignant story of love family doing the right thing not being spoiled or overly competitive and most of all chocolate lots and lots of chocolate this film is a must see for burtondepp fans and for fans how like their chocolate visually stunning and dark                   johnny depp has always been know for his dark strange and engrossing performances  there is only one film that comes to mind that depp has taken a light hearted turn and that was in marc fosters biopic of famed peter pan author  jm barrie finding neverland here depp once again displays his skills as an actor he gives audiences a performance that does not come off as eerie but eccentric quirky and strange which for a burton movie that is not too had to grasp depp delivers every step of the way and he never falters for one minute in his audacious role as willy wonka freddie highmore is fantastic in this he is so honest earnest and cheerful that he lifts this film out of its dark style and brings some light into the picture highmore is very skilled and if he was taken seriously as an actor he would truly  be great and he  is highmore has all the makings of a fantastic actor and alongside deppfor the second time  he  holds his own quite nicely  and silences the doubtersme being one that he is worthy of being called an actor the rest of the cast including christopher lee david kelly noah taylor and helena bonham carter all deliver fine supporting performances in this fantastic fantasy adventure                   charlie and the chocolate factory is fun wild zany outrageously enjoyable and delightful it is a film that so hugely entertaining it does not feel like you are watching a movie more as if you are living it burton has done wonders here and this film does not get as much praise as it should it is a richly layered and well thought out film that exceeds all expectations it definitely exceeded my expectations  it shows how sometimes    the thing you want the most is not always what is best for you   and how sometimes just because youâre down and out doesnt mean youâre any less fortunate than the next

Jul 20 2009,negative,really dark not that the first one wasnt but johnny deppneed i say more  i would have assumed it would be the continuation of willy wanka and now charlie is running it but alass thst would require hollywood to produce something new instead of just remaking the old rewrapping it and trying to get a new generation into and old storyguess im just showing my age

Jul 17 2009,positive,johnny depp puts on another excellent performance along side amazing child actor freddie highmore its a modern and entertaining take on the classic but its overshadowed by depps performance which is excellent but also rather creepy either way it is still an overall fun family film
Jul 17 2009,positive,the best movie ever my favorite
Jul 17 2009,neutral,though it is truer to the book its visually nifty and johnny depp is his classically wacky self tim burtons riff on charlie  the chocolate factory lacks what is most important in a roald dahl adaptation next to its dark humor and that is life though depp makes willy wonka his own hes no gene wilder and the cast of preteens except for freddie highmore lack that wonderful spark of energy that the originals cast of kids had tim burton is a great director but overall charlie  the chocolate factory is only good eye candy
Jul 17 2009,negative,actually kind of creepy

Jul 17 2009,positive,i always believed that depp would make a good willy wonka and he did but he was more bizarre than creepy  and creepy was what wilders original wonka was so excellent at being  all the same i really liked this movie  the kids all bar charlie of course were brilliantly awful  true to his usual style burton made the chocolate factory look fantastic and i dearly love charlies lopsided family home

Jul 15 2009,positive,a lot of critics griped about johnny depps creepy performance of willy wonka but i thought that was the whole point of the character  even in the original willy wonka gene wilder is intensely creepy at times but with a lot more subtlety  i had no problem with depp being a little over the top to add creepiness to a story that is supposed to be creepy      as usual tim burtons visuals are strong and whimsical very obviously creating a style much different than willy wonka and the chocolate factory  the original spent more time in the first half focusing on the lengths that some people would go to to get a ticket often hilariously so  in this remake more time is spent on the back story of willy wonka and the family characters are more welldeveloped as well  this approach doesnt lack for the dark humor of the first one though its just a different focus      the only things i hate about this movie are danny elfman and the one guy who plays the oompa loompas  when i saw it for the first time the musical numbers grated heavily on my nerves  it really distracted from the movie  when i watched it again i purposefully ignored the music and enjoyed the movie more having done that  usually i like danny elfmans scores and i absolutely love all of the music from the nightmare before christmas but i really hate every song in charlie and the chocolate factory  yeah lets get one guy to do all the dancing and mess with the tempo and pitch of his voice a hundred times that should be great  and another thing im sorry to expose my ignorance to who the actor actually is but i remember reading in several places how he did such a great job and they talked like he had been in many things before  ive never seen him before in my life until the stupid cameo in revenge of the fallen this year and the use of him as the only oompa loompa with a hundred different voices and costumes was tiresome and as corny and dumb as elfmans music      i still give charlie a high score because most of the acting is great and if you can ignore the dumb music the movie can actually be very entertaining  elfman dropped the ball but burton and depp more than pick up the slack
Jul 15 2009,positive,ol i can mrjdepp is a talented actor

Jul 7 2009,positive,ha ha tim burton has done it again his mix of dark humor and great execution with the visuals the movie is an feast for the eyes that made it even more enjoyable to watch and this one is based on the actual book and is not a musical now i have two gripes about this film    1 i think johnny depp is somewhat bad in this film yeah the execution is good but one thing is missing he doesnt sing he lacks the effect that gene wilder had maybe its the theme of this movie but wait that doesnt make a valid excuse anyone seen sweeny todd johnny depps character sings and i thought he was great while he sung so how come he cant sing here    2 the songs suck so much the reason why the first one had such a profound effect on me is the magical songs that made the experience so enjoyable    now this isnt a bad film its good but not the same as the original one

Jul 1 2009,positive,this film is amazing johnny depp plays the best willy wonka hes so funny
Jul 1 2009,positive,charlie and the chocolate factory is one of those movies with a n amazing start but from one point it takes a point for the worse approximately the first 50 minutes were almost perfect with the characters getting introduced and in a way charlie and the chocolate factory proved to be a thrill but after 50 minutes this film changes in the end it turns out to be an ordianry kids movie trying to teach kids a lesson of not being greedy and have devotion to your family cmon compared to the start the ending is nothing it is so exhausting and you have to wait for the end on the positive side this film has a strong performance from johnny depp this film may be enjoyable for kids but will not be able to entertain adults

Jun 28 2009,positive,ok but thought jdsa acting was too stiffno twinkle in his eye like gene wiler
Jun 28 2009,negative,cant beat the original
Jun 28 2009,negative,health warning this particular confection contains   nuts johnny depp playing wonka like the lost lovechild of michael jackson   artificial colours the special effects and production design will make your eyes bleed   extremely dark chocolate the film often veers on the wrong side of creepy and depp and deep roy dont help creeps    overall a disappointing mess a new adaptation of a classic book that pales in comparison to the original adaptation especially the songs

Jun 27 2009,positive,like the older version with wilder better
Jun 27 2009,positive,this ones just weird  its really cool as long as you dont compare it to the 1970s classic  depp does the role justice and lee gives it the added heart but where it shines is the musical numbers
Jun 27 2009,negative,seemed to be another remake to soon

Jun 25 2009,negative,this movie is poorly made annoying and completely pointless it lacks all the humanity of the original whilst having johnny depp give one of the poorest performances of his careerthe summary describes tim burton as acclaimed simply because he is famous when anyone with a knowledge of movies beyond the summer blockbusters could tell you he is a contemporary director of mediocre talent and could no more fix this mess of a movie than produce anything worthy of the title acclaimed

Jun 14 2009,positive,psychological movie  wow
Jun 14 2009,positive,this film is by no means bad its not great either its manageable    i enjoyed this film but what bugs me is that people tend to compare this film to the original and that has red flags waving all over it    you cant compare this film to the 1971 version because this film is not a remake its an adaptation of the book yes it strays from the books story a little to make way for pointless modern day pop culture references but johnny depp was not out impersonating gene wilder and tim burton copied little if anything from the 1971 version    theres a lot in this film which is likable johnny depps deviation from his jack sparrowtype fervor freddy highmores unmatchable cuteness dancing midgets and snobby spoiled brat children being put in their place chocolate suckers juicing machines garbage chutes and taffy pullers    what makes this film struggle is its director yes tim burton we know well done you wooed the hearts of critics with the same style youve used since your first movie the fact that you even survived in the business long enough with youre gothemo panache needs to be applauded    but mr burton youve committed the cardinal sin of a stylistic filmmaker which is to let the appearance of the film do all the talking instead of letting the story speak for itself most people saw this film only because they wanted to see what would happen if your style told the story but the story doesnt need your motifs to be center stage while it gets shoved into the background    maybe to todays add and candyjunkie kid audience its the holy grail of film but this film falls back on merchandising for hot topic shoppers who frost themselves over nightmare before christmas lunchboxes    ultimately its a great interpretation of the book and it shouldnt be compared to the first film because there is no comparison i enjoyed watching a spoiled rich brat being pushed headfirst into a garbage chute and you will too but dont let burtons typical presentation make you believe it is a great movie
Jun 14 2009,positive,i love it and like to watch it again again
Jun 14 2009,positive,you know johnny depps performance is stellar however creepy  too many colors  another film doing a injustice to the orginal
Jun 14 2009,positive,nice but mr wonka is kinda scary

Jun 14 2009,neutral,original was wayyyy better
Jun 14 2009,negative,i like jonny depp bt the original iz better
Jun 14 2009,positive,prefer the one with gene wilder
Jun 14 2009,positive,johnny depp  ahhhhh he looks f good
Jun 14 2009,neutral,willy wonka and the chocolate factory was only a slightly better movie but this was a closer adaptation to the book when i was 6 i read 2 books right after seeing the movies first was the wizard of oz then this one in both cases it annoyed little me that a there was unnecessary music added songs i didnt even like in both cases and b there were too many changes in both movies with some of my favorite things in the books omitted so i kind of appreciated that tim burton made the movie much more like the book buuut the rock and roll rendition of the oompa loompa song really bothered me as did the cgi version of augustus gloop what you cant have fat kids in movies these days while gene wilder is cool johnny depp worked just as well maybe even better still the new movie just rubbed me the wrong way
Jun 14 2009,positive,the original was better
Jun 14 2009,positive,omg amzing i love chocolate

Jun 14 2009,negative,fairly faithful in many places but somehow nowhere near as good as the novel as i remember it from being a kid
Jun 14 2009,positive,sort of hitandmiss  hate the additional backstory with the dentist father  but depp is amazing as ever
Jun 14 2009,positive,willy wonka is semisweet and nuts    this is a remake of the classic movie willy wonka and the chocolate factory tim burton managed to get his touch to this otherwise sweet story and it turned out fantastic johnny depp plays the wacky willy wonka and i always love when depp plays those wacky role because hes so much fun to watch if you like tim burton and johnny depp this movie is definetely one to watch perhaps with your family
