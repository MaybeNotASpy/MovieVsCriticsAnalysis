"Apr 12, 2024",negative," “Napoleon” (2023) is Ridley Scott’s latest film, an epic biopic about Napoleon Bonaparte (Joaquin Phoenix), his rise to power and his relationship with Josephine (Vanessa Kirby). It starts with the execution of Marie Antoinette (Catherine Walker) and ends with Bonaparte’s death in exile. The little over two and a half hour film (a four hour director’s cut exists) takes its viewers on a sumptuous yet tedious paint by the numbers tour of the self-appointed Emperor’s life offering little to no insight into the man, the people around him or the time, but prioritizes mocking the little man—not in size, but in terms of insecurity—and hoping to displace historical and cultural memory of him by becoming the definitive film about the man. Unfortunately to do so, it would have to sustain a viewer’s interest for the entire run time. I was very excited to see “Napoleon” because I had comp time burning a hole in my pocket (if a holiday falls on a Saturday, and you work on the Friday before and Monday after the holiday, you get a floating day off that is good for 30 day). It was my first daytime screening and first double feature screening day—the other film was Eli Roth’s “Thanksgiving” (2023). I love Ridley Scott, an entertaining director who has made some of my favorite movies: “Alien” (1979) and “Blade Runner” (1982). He has also made movies that I have despised such as “Prometheus” (2012). His latest films, “All the Money in the World” (2017) and “House of Gucci” (2021), have been about the pitfalls of famous families with money set in Italy and are great prurient fun because these movies feel like you are seeing something private and exclusive. It is mostly spectacle where viewers can leave feeling superior to the people on the screen, and “Napoleon” seems to be more in line with that goal, and not like his deeply serious action-adventure dramas like “Gladiator” (2000) and “Kingdom of Heaven” (2005) in which Scott respects the protagonist. So if you are expecting “Napoleon” to be like one of his fact-based, somber films like “Black Hawk Down” (2001) or “American Gangster” (2007), keep on moving. If you are looking for a film that looks as if Scott has a time machine and took his equipment and crew with him, then “Napoleon” is the movie for you. It is sumptuous: costumes, sets, the three major battle sequences. The coronation scene was a recreation of Jacques Louis David’s painting, “Coronation of Napoleon.” The most stunning battle is the film’s centerpiece: the Battle of Austerlitz. If there was no audio, the film would be perfect. With the audio, Scott made some bold creative choices that did not work and provided more insight into the director than the titular historical figure that Scott purported to be making a film about. Side note: while I studied the French Revolution and the period following, I am not making any allegations about whether Scott’s film is historically accurate and do not have an educated opinion about the real-life Bonaparte. I do not care enough to do a historical deep dive, especially since Scott is very vocal about not caring either. These are my impressions of Scott’s thoughts on the period based on his film. Scott is not a fan of the French Revolution and is a royalist. Also as a British person, it is not a surprise that maybe he would have a bias against Bonaparte and the French, feel a bit tenderhearted towards queens and prefer an established class structure instead of a more fluid approach. “Napoleon” opens with the execution of Marie-Antoinette, and it is a scene filled with pathos: a mother protecting her children, the cruel crowd taunting her, recording Marie-Antoinette’s breath to reflect her fear and effort to keep it together. He shows no such sympathy to subsequent former revolutionaries in danger and sees them as hypocrites using ideals to get wealthy and supplant the royals. He sees their pain as a grand joke. Scott initially depicts Bonaparte as above the emotional fray, quietly observing, focused and seems to admire Bonaparte most when he is at his most humble, undercover, and making battle plans. Bonaparte gets the ragged breath treatment during the first battle, the Siege of Toulon. Once Josephine hits the scene, he becomes a blowhard, pathetic, one-minute lover, a bumbler who humiliates himself every minute of the day, which is fine, but monotonous for a long movie. Josephine gets straight up depicted as a whore, not only a married woman who had lovers. Josephine had descendants, and if I was Scott, I’d watch my back. [Side note: French versus American/British films have very different sensibilities and tone when it comes to sex and adultery. I have no idea how Bonaparte and Josephine felt about their relationship, and again, do not care to read their letters to each other, but my gut tells me that a British person would lose something in translation and automatically consider adultery to be a character defect and a sign of immortality whereas French films barely lift an eyebrow at couples have multiple lovers and knowing about it. Bonaparte was not a typical French man, but considering that these lovers did not end up dead, and Josephine was the love of his life, it feels as if any British or American director would be incapable of not projecting their own prudish judgment on this couple.) “Napoleon” is one of those films where most of the actors speak with a British accent, which tends to be confusing. The action unfolds in Britain, France, Egypt, Austria and Russia. If everyone speaks in a British accent, how is the viewer supposed to know that they are in Austria. It requires being riveted every second of the film and knowing that if you see people playing cards in a long opulent hall, bang, the scene is in Austria. You’re welcome. Now you will know. The film flashes brief a person’s name and title appears. The location is not always indicated though Scott is generous with indicating the month, day and year and will divulge the location, but it is rapid and more inconsistent than it feels. The problem with the sun never setting on the British empire, including with casting of movies, means that it puts more of a burden on the filmmaker to provide other clear context clues, and Scott kind of does not care. His attitude is, “Who is going to check me, boo.” The box office. Anyone speaking a foreign language appeared during Napoleon’s battles outside of Europe, including Russia, which shows which countries Scott thinks of as other or not European. If there are French people in the cast, they are not playing the most prominent roles. Edouard Philipponnat, who plays Tsar Alexander, is a Finnish French actor. Phoenix is American and other than being a good actor, if I’m being generous with my analysis, his American accent may symbolize how Bonaparte was an outsider, a Corsican born Frenchman with Italian noble heritage. What does that mean on a practical, empathetic level? No idea, Scott only references how Bonaparte’s class and birthplace makes him unlike others in the ruling class, a boor, but does not expand further and seems to root for his displacement so the hierarchy can be securely back in its proper place. Even when creating a villain, the villain should be interesting, but Emperor Commodus is not in the building. It felt as if Phoenix reprised his fictional alter ego version of himself from “I’m Still Here” (2010) and became a LARPer. He is having a great time playing a buffoon who says the most outlandish, self-congratulatory things that even the briefest fact check would reveal as a lie, but it is tiresome to hit the same joke repeatedly as if you were watching the last half hour of “Saturday Night Live.” If you are looking for a performance that makes you forget that you are watching a film and feels lived in, you will have to wait until the denouement when the Duke of Wellington (Rupert Everett) finally puts a stop to Bonaparte’s shenanigans. He is the only person who reacts like a real person would. After the British capture Bonaparte, Bonaparte holds an impromptu court over breakfast lecturing a group of sailor children. Wellington walks in horrified and astonished that anyone allowed such foolishness, and Everett’s exasperated tone and line read showed the right amount of astonishment at his men’s incompetence. It is a genuinely funny moment and made me wish that there was a way to get more Everett. The other jokes are about laughing at someone’s expense whereas the punchline is about relatability to a completely unrelatable man, a war legend and political figure from another time. “Napoleon” is a gorgeous movie, but you won’t see it when you fall asleep between battles. The combination of pitch perfect visuals with comedic, outlandish dialogue does not ever gel, and Scott lacks the necessary pacing to let everyone enjoy the joke. Perhaps he should have partnered with Terry Gilliam."

"Mar 11, 2024",neutral," Desde hace una buena temporada, y tras mantener una conversación de lo más interesante con un buen amigo guionista, defiendo a capa y espada la idea de que opinar sobre el libreto al escribir una crítica o evaluar un largometraje no tiene ningún tipo de sentido; y el motivo de esto se encuentra en un hecho irrefutable: el texto definitivo impreso en papel se reescribirá dos veces más antes de que el producto final llegue a nuestras pantallas. La primera reescritura la hacen el director y los actores durante el rodaje, moldeando en el set las líneas de diálogo y las escenas firmadas por el escriba. La segunda y, por norma general, más severa, se efectúa en la sala de montaje, donde el equipo de edición puede llegar a alterar por completo diferentes elementos que figuraban en el guión, incluyendo partes elementales como su estructura, pudiendo deshacerse de escenas e, incluso, de subtramas enteras. El mejor ejemplo reciente que podemos utilizar para ilustrar esto, al menos teóricamente, es la 'Napoleón' de Ridley Scott. Desde que trascendió que su montaje original de cuatro horas y diez minutos se redujo hasta las dos y media para su estreno en cines, comencé a tener unas dudas sobre la solidez del proyecto que, finalmente, he terminado confirmando; y es que este recorte, lejos de ser invisible, ha terminado reflejándose en una narrativa que no hace justicia a la inmensa ambición del título ni al talento de su máximo responsable. Si algo ha demostrado Ridley Scott desde el principio de su longeva carrera, que ya se extiende durante 46 prolíficos años, es tener un talento único para dar forma a imágenes de una fuerza inigualable, ya sea en clave de ciencia ficción con obras cumbre como 'Alien' o 'Blade Runner', en apuestas bélicas como la impecable e inmersiva 'Black Hawk derribado' o en su extraordinaria incursión en el pospéplum de diseño con 'Gladiator'. Como no podría ser menos, el caso de 'Napoleón' no es una excepción a esta norma. El cineasta y el director de fotografía Dariusz Wolski, con quien ya ha colaborado en cintas como 'Marte' o 'El último duelo', han logrado capturar algunas de las secuencias de batalla más arrolladoras que hayamos visto en mucho tiempo en la gran pantalla y que compiten frente a frente con anteriores y celebrados biopics previos sobre la figura histórica protagonista. El gran problema es que estos fragmentos, entre los que destacan unas batallas de Austerlitz y Waterloo que hacen a la película digna candidata a arrasar en los apartados técnicos de la temporada de premios, no encierran ninguna emoción tras sus sobrecogedores grandes planos generales y su encarnizada violencia. ¿El motivo? La falta de una conexión entre personajes y público para que cada cañonazo y golpe de bayoneta suponga algo más que una oportunidad para exhibir músculo formal. Como comentaba, en su camino hacia la proyección en salas, 'Napoleón' ha perdido una hora y media de metraje, afectando a una progresión dramática que se antoja demasiado desalvazada, fría y, por momentos, carente de alma. Esto impide un correcto desarrollo de personajes y conflictos que hace complicado empatizar con ellos, y que reduce la película a una tosca colección de escenas, conectadas gracias a intertítulos informativos y al uso de una voz en off en clave epistolar, que se suceden estimulando retinas mientras esquivan corazones. Puede que se reduzca a la simple conjetura, pero tengo la sensación —y la plena confianza— de que la versión de cuatro horas y diez minutos que llegará a Apple TV+ en el futuro cumplirá con las expectativas iniciales que había volcadas sobre el proyecto y hará justicia a la fantástica labor de Vanessa Kirby y, sobre todo, de un Joaquin Phoenix que extrae oro de un papel más grotesco, deleznable y casi caricaturesco de lo que cabía esperar."
"Mar 6, 2024",negative," While I’m not a fan of the movie, there’s a line in 2005’s “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” that has stayed with me: “Candy doesn’t have to have a point. That’s why it’s candy.” That quote kept popping up in my head while watching “Napoleon,” the latest from revered director Ridley Scott. Make no mistake, “Napoleon” is not candy—it’s not enjoyable for its own sake or some sort of sweet reward that stimulates the senses. But Scott’s new film does seem to be lacking a point, to the extent that I kept searching for some greater meaning or a reason for it to exist. It’s technically proficient but emotionally beige, a sort of neutral existence that doesn’t really check any boxes. It’s not a methodical review of historic events, often indulging in apocryphal stories rather than what actually happened. But it’s not some impassioned grand tale of legend, either, attempting to ground itself in the world of Bonaparte. At the same time, it’s also not some examination of the inner world of the would-be world conqueror, making his motivations and processes an inconsistent and rarely definable quality of the character. Is that the point? That the real Napoleon can’t be known? That life is a mix of myth and mundane? I genuinely have no clue… and it is vexing. After many years of many filmmakers attempting to take on the story, “Napoleon” arrives horrifically inert and painfully tedious where its 158-minute runtime often feels like 158 days. The movie centers on Napoleon Bonaparte (Joaquin Phoenix) and his rise through the ranks of the military (and French society) through his various victories for the aristocracy. While he earns many wins on the battlefield, almost all on the backs of enormous casualties on his own side, it’s the infighting among the constantly shifting ruling class that presents opportunities for the successful general. It culminates in his ascension to emperor before incurring multiple defeats and exile (twice over). (Spoiler alert, I suppose, but you’ve had over 200 years to know the arc of his story.) Meanwhile, during all this tumult and ambition, Napoleon falls for Josephine (Vanessa Kirby), a former noble that fell into the prisons during the French Revolution and eventually becomes Bonaparte’s bride. There are many ups and downs of the relationship, much of it around affairs and a lack of Josephine providing an heir for the man who would be king of the world, but Napoleon is utterly enchanted by this woman…albeit showing it in his own way. These two tracks—political plots and his homelife—are intertwined in various ways that reveal a complicated man who has basic drives (love, sex, ambition, jealousy, pride) but shows them in increasingly odd ways. Is that the point? That this looming figure is just like us who happens to benefit from being at the right place at the right time while remaining simple if emotionally awkward? I just don’t know. Nothing in “Napoleon” is consistent, except for how lethargic everything feels. The inner workings of the court should be rife with intrigue, or drama, or comedy, or something. Instead, it’s a rote rotation of characters as power transfers between various members over the decades. That tumultuous marriage with its passionate romance and clashes should be brimming with emotion and reveal something about the characters or the historical figures or something. But the script, from writer David Scarpa, does very little with these moments. There are some bits of comedy with Napoleon making quips or being a randy husband. There’s some pathos as Josephine struggles as she is gradually pushed aside (yet still retained and fairly controlled by her eventual ex-husband). But all of it is just occasional and slight, and never feels like a piece of a cohesive whole. The fact that “Napoleon” has a singular author is astounding because this feels like an exquisite corpse where each section is passed to another writer with a constant mixing of emotions and meanings. Is that the point? That a person’s life isn’t part of some grand tableau but an inconsistent melding of the complementary and the contrary? “Napoleon” may not be profound, but surely the man behind “Blade Runner,” “Gladiator,” and so many other grandiose titles, delivers impressive set pieces, right? For even with his less-than-great entries (like “Prometheus,” “The Counselor,” or “Exodus: Gods and Kings”), Ridley Scott produces some incredible spectacle and impact sequences. Unfortunately, that is not the case with “Napoleon,” with most of those big battles not feeling epic or producing much in the way of grand scope. The scale is there, with many extras (or at least digital ones) and great costuming and era-appropriate props who mostly get gruesomely slaughtered in the abattoir of war. But the blocking/staging isn’t interesting nor are there any particularly memorable images from any of these clashes. And the lack of emotional investment in the lead or any of the nameless supporting soldiers means that nothing really has much of an impact. Is that the point? That war isn’t meant to be a visual delight or there are billions of nameless faceless who have sacrificed themselves at the altar of ambitious, petty men? This lack of engaging imagery extends beyond the battlefields to the courts and balls and palaces. Again, the film delivers beautiful costuming and some cool recreations of sites. But “Napoleon” is shot so boringly with uninteresting lighting and what feels like a somewhat obscuring scrim that dials down all the interest and brilliance of each scene. DP Dariusz Wolski is better than this. The man shot 1998’s “Dark City” which is a sumptuous feast for the eyes with interesting set-ups, lighting, and camerawork. And he’s done a lot of great work since (collaborating often with Scott). But one would think that there’d be a focus on natural light to mimic the era and ground it in the mundane—especially with camera technology being such that it doesn’t need strong light sources to capture these moments. Or it would be bathed in glorious lighting to properly establish these legendary figures in these momentous times. Or switching back and forth somehow to say something, anything, about the duality or relationship between these two worlds or something. Is that the point? That it’s all just awash in uninteresting hues because this is just life, no matter the outsized person in the middle of it? It’s quite possible I just didn’t understand “Napoleon.” I got the plot points and followed along with the narrative and character development. But whatever was the larger message that Scott and crew sought to explore feels non-existent. This lavish production never feels like an incredible story, nor does it ever feel particularly intimate. Truthfully, “Napoleon” rarely feels like anything; perfunctory emotions that are adequately portrayed by talented actors adrift in a sea of tedium. It’s a literal epic, crossing time and geographies, but is an utterly hollow exercise that leaves audiences with one resounding question: what was the point? You can find our full content archive

"Feb 12, 2024",neutral," This is Paul Salfen with your KLAK Movie Minute. In theaters now is Napoleon, the epic Ridley Scott biopic on the diminutive French leader starring the not so diminutive and American-accented Joaquin Phoenix that is historically questionable but still an epic piece of cinema. While a lot focuses on the wild and crazy relationship between him and his wife that made him even crazier, played perfectly by Vanessa Kirby, this two and a half hour-plus battle-heavy film shies away from nothing and really does give you kind of what you expect- epic action in a way that we know and love Scott for and a bonkers performance that we know and love Phoenix for. Supposedly there is a 4 hour cut that probably makes more sense and would be more digestible in a two-part viewing, but for now we get a big screen experience that will for sure be a divisive watch amongst critics and viewers – but likely totally hated by the French. I personally found it a fascinating watch and exactly what I expected but have since found that many don’t agree. But if you go in knowing that it’s taking a lot of liberties with some questionable dialogue and some humorous and ridiculous actions by Napoleon that likely didn’t happen, it may just serve as some good entertainment under the “it is what it is” cinematic category. That’s it for this week. Join me next week and every week for another Movie Minute right here on 97.5 KLAK, AMFM Magazine, and RECRD."

"Feb 2, 2024",negative," The latest biopic of Napoleon, directed by 85-year old Ridley Scott, attempts to tackle the rise and fall of Napoleon Bonaparte, the military officer who rose on the crest of the French Revolution, orchestrated a coup d’état in 1799 and went on to crown himself Emperor in 1804. Napoleon was eventually defeated by the combined forces of a number of European powers at Waterloo (now Belgium) in June 1815. He died in exile, on the island of Saint Helena, in the Atlantic Ocean, six years later. Bonaparte (1769-1821) was a complex, world-historical figure. The era of the Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815), which originated in the great revolution of 1789 and the revolutionary wars fought from 1792-1802, was critical in the development of modern society. Scott, however, does not indicate in his public comments or in the body of the film itself any great interest in history and historical processes. His Napoleon is a shallow collection of impressions, “psychological” insight of the dime-store variety and brief battle scenes, which are not even presented so as to explain Napoleon’s military prowess. Napoleon opens with the following titles: “1789—Revolution in France,” “People are driven by misery to revolution … and brought back by revolution to misery.” This profound insight seems to sum up the filmmakers’ view, that the Revolution—and perhaps history in general—is rather a waste of time. The Revolution was a pointless event, everybody ended up just as badly off as they started out. All in all, they should have simply stayed in bed. In any event, as the film’s action begins, the viewer is rushed headlong into a sequence depicting the execution of Queen Marie Antoinette (Catherine Walker) in October 1793. We see the bloodthirsty “mob” taunting the monarch as she stoically raises her head up in defiance walking to the guillotine, pelted by rotten vegetables. Where Scott’s sympathies lie here are evident. The young Bonaparte (Joaquin Phoenix) is an aloof and cold onlooker, his presence a taking of artistic liberty that has no basis in fact. We then witness the Jacobin revolutionary Maximilien Robespierre (Sam Troughton) addressing the question of the queen’s execution before the National Convention. “Terror is nothing more than justice—prompt, severe, inflexible,” asserts Robespierre, portrayed unsympathetically. Napoleon watches the Convention’s session. He meets with Paul Barras (Tahar Rahim), a powerful politician and later a member of the ruling Directory, who is seeking to recapture the southern French city of Toulon from the royalist forces aligned with the British. “Capture the fort that dominates the harbor and you have the city,” the young artillery officer tells Barras. After storming the city and routing the British navy, the success of Napoleon’s victory in Toulon elevates his rank and stature. Following the military triumph, Barras tells Napoleon that Robespierre is “unfit to rule” because of his “lawless terror.” Napoleon, previously a supporter of Robespierre, who helped promote the younger man to the rank of brigadier-general, swiftly moves to the side of reaction. Robespierre finds himself denounced and deposed in a turbulent gathering of the Convention in the Thermidorian Reaction of July 1794 (“Thermidor” was the 11th month in the new French Republican Calendar). He is sent to the guillotine, with a bloodthirsty mob cheering the execution on, just as it cheered the death of Marie Antoinette. Thus ends the radical phase of the French Revolution, and the consolidation of the new bourgeois state and society is set in motion. The rest of the two-and-a-half hour film jumps along from one event or episode to the next, often with little dramatic or historical coherence. We follow Napoleon’s courtship of the aristocratic widow Joséphine de Beauharnais (Vanessa Kirby) and later his 1798 campaign in Egypt, a foreign escapade the Directory hoped would reduce his stature and popularity at home. The events in Egypt are somewhat ludicrously portrayed, with the French troops bombarding the Pyramids, an invention of the film. Returning to France, Napoleon accuses the leaders of the Directory of corruption and incompetence: “I have returned to France to find her bankrupt.” He begins to conspire against the ruling group with figures such as Emanuel Sieyès (Julian Rhind-Tutt), Charles Maurice de Talleyrand (Paul Rhys) and Joseph Fouché (John Hodgkinson), the Minister of Police, who has previously helped plot Robespierre’s downfall. The fateful coup of 18th Brumaire (November 9, 1799) is carried out, which leads to Napoleon’s coming to power. The film is relatively accurate here. Bonaparte apparently lost his nerve and nearly failed in the coup attempt against the Council of Five Hundred. The boisterous deputies derided Napoleon as an “outlaw” and a “power-hungry upstart,” and assaulted him. He was only able to succeed ultimately, with the help of his brother Lucien and soldiers armed with bayonets, in a bloodless coup. Napoleon becomes the First Consul of France. Scott’s Napoleon proceeds to charge ahead through the rest of the principal events of its subject’s life. In 1804, he crowns himself Emperor, an act that famously enraged Ludwig van Beethoven, whose Symphony No. 3 (“Eroica”) was initially dedicated to Napoleon. Over the course of the subsequent decade of war, the film provides glimpses of various battles, including the famed French victory over the Austrians and Russians at Austerlitz (1805). Finally, there is Bonaparte’s fateful decision to invade Russia, and its consequences. The Battle of Borodino (1812), a pyrrhic victory for Napoleon in which his army sustains colossal losses, is followed by the occupation of Moscow by French forces. The Russians largely abandon the city and set it ablaze, depriving Napoleon’s forces, far from home, of food and other supplies. Not surprisingly, the film’s quasi-denouement takes place at Waterloo in 1815, where French troops are defeated by two armies, one of them a British-led force commanded by the Duke of Wellington (Rupert Everett). Napoleon is sent into a much more severe second exile, on Saint Helena, where he passes his final days. As a whole, Scott’s film leaves the viewer interested in history none the wiser for the experience. It provides little insight, aside from the most superficial, into Napoleon as a personality and historical figure, or the French Revolution—including its earthshaking intellectual sources in the Enlightenment—and its aftermath. The work devotes a good deal of its time to the relationship between Napoleon and Joséphine, their sexual issues and jealousies, and her childlessness (and the couple’s consequent splitting up), to no great effect. The focus feels forced, in part driven by contemporary gender politics. Joséphine is obliged by the latter to be a decisive force in Napoleon’s life and career. This Napoleon even rather foolishly hints that Bonaparte’s invasion of Russia was driven in part by his jealousy over his former wife’s flirtation with the youthful Tsar Alexander I (Edouard Philipponnat). The acting in general is decent, although Phoenix is over his head attempting to play a substantial personality. The limitations of his performance are the limitations of the script and direction. He treats the character largely as a desperate loner and upstart, someone trying to prove himself to the European upper echelons, bumbling and mumbling—in unconvincing “method acting” style—his way through. As noted, many of the events in Napoleon are rushed past, hardly giving the viewer the ability to register them or consider their significance. The technical elements, and the cinematography and spectacle, are all impressive, but they add little to one’s knowledge. Scott presumably admires Napoleon as a military genius, which he certainly was, but this was rooted in large part in the social transformations set in motion by the 1789 Revolution, which receives no discussion whatsoever. Frederick Engels observed that “the science of war created by the revolution and Napoleon was the necessary result of the new relations brought about by the revolution.” The two characteristics of Napoleon’s “magnificent discoveries,” mass warfare and mobility, presuppose “the degree of civilisation of the bourgeois epoch.” Ultimately, we gather, Scott views the French Revolution and the entire epoch as not much more than gigantic mistakes leading to millions of dead. Napoleon ends with a lengthy list of deaths in the various conflicts after 1789. History, according to this philistine conception, is just one pointless thing after the other. The Napoleonic era has been the subject of serious literature and art in the past. Some of the most remarkable novels of the 19th century represent the period, including Stendhal’s The Charterhouse of Parma, Thackeray’s Vanity Fair and Hugo’s unabridged Les Misérables, all of which treat the Battle of Waterloo, and, of course, Tolstoy’s monumental War and Peace, which recounts Napoleon’s invasion of Russia. All of these works, and many others, attempted to make sense of the events in relation to the existing European society and its dynamics. Ridley Scott has never demonstrated such an interest or ability (Alien, Blade Runner, Gladiator, etc.), and doesn’t demonstrate it here. One even suspects that Scott may be nervous about the prospects of revolution today, however justified such an event might be as a response to widespread social misery. Moreover, Scott, who favors spectacle over substance in his filmmaking, adopts a distinctly cavalier attitude in response to criticisms of the film’s inaccuracies. Scott commented, “When I have issues with historians, I ask, ‘Excuse me, mate, were you there? No? Well, shut the f––k up then.’“ Artistic liberties are inevitable, but the latter need to correspond in an important, constructive manner to the spirit and substance of the content under examination. Unfortunately, Scott is out of his depth here. Stanley Kubrick intended to tackle the life of Napoleon and carried out extensive research. He was unable to make the film, instead directing Barry Lyndon (1975), set in part during the Seven Years War. Kubrick’s project has apparently been taken up by Steven Spielberg in the form of an HBO television series. Sergei Bondarchuk’s Waterloo (1970), featuring Rod Steiger as Napoleon and Christopher Plummer as Wellington, with a brief appearance by Orson Welles as Louis XVIII, is also worth noting. Napoleon Bonaparte’s historical role has long been subjected to Marxist analysis, which has unraveled its contradictions, as both a figure of reaction in relation to the radical, egalitarian impulses of the French Revolution, and as a terrifying “Jacobin” abomination to feudal Europe and the British ruling class. The French Revolution, Engels argued, was the victory “of the great masses of the nation, working in production and in trade, over the privileged idle classes, the nobles and the priests.” But that triumph “soon revealed itself as exclusively the victory of a smaller part of this ‘estate,’ as the conquest of political power by the socially privileged section of it—i.e., the propertied bourgeoisie.” Bonaparte, Trotsky once wrote, halted the Revolution “by means of a military dictatorship. However, when the French troops invaded Poland, Napoleon signed a decree: ‘Serfdom is abolished.’ This measure was dictated not by Napoleon’s sympathies for the peasants, nor by democratic principles but rather by the fact that the Bonapartist dictatorship based itself not on feudal, but on bourgeois property relations.” On another occasion, Trotsky pointed out that “Robespierre sought his support among the artisans, the Directory among the middle bourgeoisie. Bonaparte allied himself with the banks. All these shifts—which had, of course, not only a political but also a social significance—occurred, however, on the basis of the new bourgeois society and state.” These are complex, but not esoteric or inaccessible analyses. The artist who starts out by turning a deliberately blind eye to serious historical study and research, who decides “to fly by the seat of his pants” when taking on epochal events, is unlikely to come up with a compelling or enduring work. Scott’s Napoleon is one such result."
"Jan 21, 2024",negative," Who was it that said history was just one damn thing after another? This is what Sir Ridley Scott‘s epic Napoleon (2023) feels like when not focused on the electrifying performance of Joaquin Phoenix, as the diminutive great man himself, and his passionate, playful, volatile relationship with his lover and wife (and ex-wife), Josephine — beautifully portrayed by an entirely miscast Vanessa Kirby.  For starters, Josephine was six years Bonaparte’s senior (Phoenix is 14 years older than Kirby), and while that bit of information, in itself, maybe would not mean much now, socially, it would be a significant hurdle in the period of history depicted, as well as in the troubles that led to the dissolution of the pair’s marriage — the inability of Josephine to conceive an heir to the throne, and salvage Napoleon’s lineage from oblivion (she already had children, from a previous marriage).  The psychological mechanics of the relationship, as well as the power games of the duo also would have been well informed by this particular nugget of age seniority of the Empress, as well as her calculating yet quite nourishing approach to handling the mesmerised, lustful advances of the love-sick Bonaparte. She was also a downtrodden sophisticated woman-of-the-world to the socially awkward victorious arriviste, and more of that dynamic would have meant a better grasp of Napoleon’s historically documented obsession. Then again, the actor, himself, is perhaps too old for the role, yet is perfectly cast for it. He acts as if he were the younger person in the couple — and thus upholds the illusion. In Phoenix, finally, there seems to have been a significant breakthrough in the portrayal of the military genius, in comparison to all the performances that preceded (the ones which I have seen). There is such a strategic ferocity behind the way he moves within a space, a kinetic immediacy, assessing all its weaknesses, finding ways to resolve the problem of conquering an area in an entirely mathematical way. His significant lack of consideration regarding the means necessary to achieve that end, yet an efficiency and expediency of his actions, all traits of someone at the pinnacle of military acumen. As are the reasons why he was truly admired by his troops, and even by enemy soldiers (see the aftermath of Waterloo).  Equally, his overt disdain towards anyone lacking combat abilities is as palpable as anything, aimed most towards whom he perceives as undeserving examples of the aristocratic class. What we gauge about Bonaparte from Scott’s Napoleon is that he was perhaps a man of extreme violence, but never someone that would downplay and undermine true merit. Even his ironic and mischievous approach to emperorship seems entirely plausible. When we are presented with a close-up of Pheonix’s face while plotting an ingenious attack — we believe him, and this brings us nearer to an understanding who Napoleon was, at the core of things. There is nothing about the performance that is posturing and self-referential. It comes from a place of prolonged understanding, almost a haunting, an invocation of the doomed French Emperor, as if the spirit of the man had been resurrected by some form of cinematic magic for the purposes Napoleonic apologia. However, other than the red-hot focus at the character of the central figure of Scott’s lengthy production, and his singular passions, all else in it is merely an opulent display in high cinematic skill (by frequent collaborator, cinematographer Dariusz Wolski) — but there is not much heart and soul put into the drama of it. The battle scenes, although meticulously choreographed, seem too anecdotal and procedural i.e. one damn thing after another, all except two — Napoleon’s advance on Moscow, his shock at seeing the city in self-inflicted flames, and the part in the Battle of Austerlitz where an entire army seems to disappear into the ice. This is because these scenes had what the others of the ilk lacked — a depth of emotional involvement in warfare, one perfect shot telling us so much else we needed to know. A talent Scott masterfully displayed throughout Gladiator (2000). Even if it was a strategic choice on Scott’s part — portraying a man’s day job (war) and messianic tendencies (empire) as only a backdrop to the personal, while spending all available dramatic energy on Bonaparte’s character and his desire for Josephine, it still backfired. Offering the public a spectacle, when in fact you are telling an intimate love story, sometimes does."
"Jan 18, 2024",negative," Ridley Scott es un veterano en crear grandes épicas que terminan desinflándose por su incapacidad para sostener su sentido del propósito. Esto es: lo que podría haber más allá de las batallas, sangre derramada y grandes luchas a campo abierto bien filmadas. Apenas evitó que le ocurriera en “Gladiador” (2000), pero el desencanto fue muy visible en “El último duelo” (2021), en la que convirtió una historia de violación en una lucha campal entre dos desabridos enemigos. Entre ambas cosas, se encuentra “Napoleón” (2023), una obra extraña, con tono inclasificable y que es la pesadilla de un historiador. En este biopic del dictador francés, el personaje es alto y esbelto, aunque el juego de escalas intenta empequeñecer a Joaquin Phoenix, sin lograrlo. Eso, mientras, narra la historia del militar que se convirtió en emperador y lo hace desde la oscuridad: sus malas decisiones, errores tácticos, mal carácter y curiosamente, desde el amor. Ahora bien, el problema real que atraviesa el guion de David Scarpa, es que la cinta intenta usar la imagen del militar y del monarca a fuerza para hacer un comentario político moderno. Lo cual no estaría mal — ni sería del todo desdeñable — a no ser por un específico escollo en el desarrollo. Phoenix interpreta a un Napoleón enfurecido, que apenas lanza diatribas con los dientes apretados de furia. Un hombre marginal — en la ficción, se hace hincapié a su origen corso — que sabe exactamente qué es lo que desean escuchar los hombres que le siguen. Por un lado, está la del hombre que lidera un país a la victoria. Por el otro, el atropellado que murmura y gesticula en pleno paroxismo de cólera. Al extremo de todo eso, el amante, embobado por la belleza y la energía de la mujer en su vida. Y por último, el personaje que creó a través de todas esas cosas y que se elevó a un pedestal a fuerza de coraje, audacia y una evidente incapacidad para escuchar a la sensatez. Napoleón, visto por Scott, está más cerca de la locura que de la genialidad. Un extremo inquietante que arrasa todas sus diatribas con la historia y convierte a las escasas seis batallas — de 61 — que, por razones nunca explicadas, el director llevó a la pantalla. Es evidente que el realizador intentaba salirse del molde de la biografía dramatizada y presentar una paradoja de carne y hueso acerca del mal uso del poder y la forma en que la arrogancia, puede convertir cualquier tentativa de conquista — o estrategia de habilidad intelectual — en polvo. Lo deja entrever en un Waterloo oscuro con tintes de invierno (a pesar de que, en el momento real, llovía y el pantano de color cobre de la zona signó la lucha) o en los momentos introspectivos. Muchos de ellos, filmados en planos cerrados para mayor gloria de Napoleón, sobrepasado, cansado y, por último, iracundo contra todo a su alrededor. No es casual que en esas escenas Napoleón sea más moderno que la figura de escrutinio ficcional ajustado a la Francia republicana. Con mucho de líderes hechos a sí mismos y llevados por el camino del drama y el histrionismo, que saben que dependen justamente de ese músculo melodramático para funcionar y hacerse obedecer. Pero la sugerente idea — como otras tantas cosas en la película — no se explora lo suficiente como para ser atractiva. En realidad, la historia parece cortada a partes, fileteada con mano torpe y vuelta a coser por conveniencia del humor de cineasta. Por supuesto, “Napoleón” es de una envergadura enorme. La cámara de Scott es hábil y en las seis batallas que recrea hay mucho de lo aprendido en el género dramático y épico en décadas anteriores. Es una epopeya que aspira a tanto, que cuando se desinfla se lamenta que todo quede en un anuncio. Poco a poco y a medida que la trama avanza con dificultad a lo largo de dos horas y tantos minutos de metraje, el foco de interés de la cinta va de un lado a otro. El político emerge, el gran líder, pero de nuevo, Scott empalma con el hombre amante que corre desde Egipto, enfurecido de celos. “Napoleón” es muchas cosas, pero en ninguna forma coherente. En el mejor de los casos, un anuncio de algo que no fue. Pero para el recuerdo, el Napoleón que parece el génesis de todo tipo de líderes nocivos, enajenados e irresistibles, es todavía el elemento más rescatable en el desorden. En una cinta que pudo ser más y termina por conformarse con ser un drama con vicios de épica, es más que suficiente."
"Jan 10, 2024",negative," Ridley Scott movies always feel like capital-E Events, because they’re always about big things, case in point, Napoleon (now streaming on VOD outlets like Prime Video). Of course, HE wasn’t a big thing, per se, the French ruler being a little, you know, untall on one end, but “big things” isn’t intended to be a literal description. This period biopic reunites Scott with his Gladiator star Joaquin Phoenix, who plays Monsieur Bonaparte as a deep, deep weirdo who happens to be a genius military strategist – and also possibly the worst sex-haver in the history of having sex. In the interest of giving some focus to the story of a notorious historical figure who did a hell of a lot of conquering and political coup-de-tat-ing, the film frames the Napoleon saga within his relationship with his wife Josephine, played by Vanessa Kirby. Notably, Scott was criticized for taking some liberties with history, pushing back with a flimsy “were you actually there?” defense when he could’ve explained to all the pedants that this is a “movie,” made with writers and actors and CGI and artificial lighting and other things that render it fundamentally “inaccurate,” and therefore lends itself to “taking creative license” in pursuit of something you might call “historical fiction.” Now, if only Scott was making a passionate defense of a movie that deserved it. The Gist: We’ll cover a couple of decades, give or take a couple years, of Napoleon’s (Phoenix) life here, starting with his witnessing the public beheading of Marie Antoinette in 1793, then going all the way to Waterloo in 1815. He starts his pretty good run of gross imperialism during the siege of Toulon, leading the French’s successful assault on the British navy, during which Napoleon’s life is saved when his horse rears up and catches a cannonball that would’ve changed the living shit out of the course of history – for better or worse, I’m not sure, because this movie isn’t particularly interested in making anything particularly clear, whether it’s character motivation, detailed depictions of events or any implications spinning out of those two components. Anyway, Napoleon’s victory earns him the title of general, which leads to him playing a part in ending the Reign of Terror – his soldiers fire cannons directly into a batch of significantly less heavily armed civilian rebels – and therefore becoming one of the country’s key political leaders. At this point, we learn that Napoleon is far better at commandeering troops than speaking to other human beings in a social setting. He walks into a party and gives off serious nerdtrovert wallflower vibes, but his reputation precedes him enough that the widow Josephine (Kirby) is compelled to approach him and ask him why he’s leering at her like a creep. They have a couple of dates, followed by this exchange between Josephine and a friend: “Do you find him without appeal?” the friend asks. “No.” “Then perhaps that is enough.” Sounds like love in its purest form! And so the lovely Josephine, perhaps a social climber or maybe someone seeking security for her children or perhaps enamored by men who look like the Jack of Diamonds from a deck of cards that have seen a few too many fiery hands of whist, marries Napoleon, after which they retire to the marital bed so he may unleash his randy inner beast (most likely a coked-up jackrabbit, or any type of ugly rodent) while she rolls her eyes, wrinkles her nose a little and does whatever people did with their brains before they could passively scroll through Instagram. From here, we’re supposed to believe that all the wild ups and downs of their marriage are the passionate emotional framework for Napoleon’s career as Tiny Emperor of France and conqueror of territories. He gets in trouble for leaving the scene of his overtaking of Egypt – cue the firing of cannonballs into the Great Pyramid of Giza, which, the pedants will point out, never really happened, and to which Scott essentially replied, hey, it looks cool though – so he can go home and chastise Josephine for taking a lover on the side, a fact that gets splashed across all the newspapers. And yet Josephine and King Cuck stay together, because the screenplay seems to insist upon their being forever bonded to each other like one thing superglued to another thing, even though we never really understand why their love-glue is so sticky in the first place.  Anyway, they really hit the rocks when the fruit juice of Napoleon’s stubby loins fails to produce an heir, something that was very important for 19th-century emperors. (There’s the possibility that Josephine is unable to conceive, but it’s more fun to ridicule his ass.) This starts a big marital battle, which, if you stretch it a little, is mirrored by Napoleon’s battle against the allied Austrian/Russian forces, since Josephine and Napoleon love each other but can’t make it work, just like Napoleon thinks he has a good thing going with the Russian tsar until he doesn’t. And the movie goes on like this for a bit, with their marriage going south as Napoleon sends his troops out to massacre and be massacred, and he does it all for her, or maybe because of her, I think, sort of, almost. What Movies Will It Remind You Of?: Scott has only directed a handful of this type of battle epic – Exodus: Gods and Kings, Kingdom of Heaven, Robin Hood, maybe Gladiator – but it seems like so many more, because each is really, really long and/or have even longer director’s cuts. Performance Worth Watching: My long-held assertion that Phoenix is worth watching in anything is put to the test with Napoleon. He seems either miscast or unable to find the key to the character’s charisma and drive. Phoenix flashes with brilliance – it’s inevitable with an actor of his caliber – and he’s fascinatingly unpredictable at times, but the performance ultimately reflects the film’s overall lack of coherence. Memorable Dialogue: “I’m not built like other men. I’m not subject to petty insecurity,” says Napoleon, who later bleats to a British ambassador like a petulant boy, “YOU THINK YOU’RE SO GREAT BECAUSE YOU HAVE BOATS!” Sex and Skin: Not much skin, but there are a couple of amusing sex scenes that illustrate Napoleon’s, to put it gently, marked lack of bedroom savvy (to reference another Scott film, see also: Matt Damon in The Last Duel).  Our Take: Napoleon is one of Scott’s many impressive mediocrities, another expensive and ambitious endeavor that doesn’t live up to the potential of its considerable talent in front of and behind the camera. It feels either rushed or underwritten or overedited, or all of the above. Its narrative crux is supposed to be the strange and beguiling mismatched romance between Jospehine and Napoleon – she’s lovely and elegant, he’s, uh, stubby and kisses her like a chihuahua attacking a dropped ice cream cone – but it seems as if the scenes that are supposed to convince us of their eternal passion have been hastily excised in order to put greater emphasis on the battle sequences. Mind you, they’re pretty good-looking battle sequences, expertly staged and executed, although they lack dramatic consequence, because the screenplay gracelessly hopscotches from one set piece to the next, and never establishes any rooting stakes in the conflict. On second thought, we don’t need rooting stakes. Rather, Scott should be cultivating our fascination and curiosity with the ethics of imperialism, and what drives men to quest for power – food for thought that never finds its footing in a mushy narrative that lacks clarity and detail, and has no flow. Tonally, it’s flat and unengaging, leaving us uncertain whether we should be taking it seriously or reading Phoenix’s simpering interpretation of Napoleon as satire. Phoenix inspires some laughter at times – “Destiny has brought me this lamb chop!” is how Napoleon punctuates one verbal scrap with Josephine – but is it intentional? Should we take this guy seriously, or is this characterization along the lines of a Looney Tunes portrayal of Hitler from the 1940s? We expect Phoenix to give a go-big-or-go-home performance, and he upends that expectation with an understated turn that feels flat and uninspired, subtle without the depth of writing to bolster it. Would Napoleon rather be rolling his cannons through Russia, or back home in Jospehine’s arms? It’s a mystery not to be solved here. There’s talk of Scott releasing a four-hour director’s cut that might salvage Napoleon, but as it stands, this 158-minute version is disappointingly incoherent."
"Jan 4, 2024",positive,Scott makes no apologies for Napoleon and never treats him as some hero for France. Napoleon succeeds at presenting the insecurities of this man’s life for audiences who may be unaware of French history. I just wish it was narrower in its scope.
"Jan 1, 2024",positive,Joaquin Phoenix’s blustering performance conquers as Napoleon.
"Jan 1, 2024",negative,"This is such a misfire. It is 2 hours and 38 minutes of my life I would like back. At the end of the movie, I knew nothing more about Napoleon than I did when it started."
"Dec 29, 2023",positive," Una multitud se reúne en la Plaza de la Revolución para presenciar la ejecución con guillotina de Marie Antoinette, la controvertida monarca francesa. Uno de los espectáculos barbáricos que dieron inicio al llamado periodo del terror de la Revolución Francesa, durante el cual miles de aristócratas y miembros de la corona fueron condenados a muerte. Entre los asistentes del brutal acto público se encontraba Napoleón Bonaparte (Joaquin Phoenix), un comandante oriundo de Córcega cuyo nombre estaba a punto de ganar notoriedad entre los más altos mandos del ejército. Tras demostrar su astucia militar en la toma del puerto de Tolón a finales de 1793, logrando expulsar a las tropas inglesas que apoyaban a la facción realista, el sagaz estratega fue escalando rápidamente de rango, ganando seguidores e involucrándose cada vez más en el ámbito político de la nación en crisis. Su rol sería decisivo en la consumación del movimiento revolucionario, luego de encabezar un exitoso golpe de Estado en el año 1799 que le convertiría en el primer cónsul de la recién formada República.  Durante su mandato, uno que se extendió hasta 1814 tras volver a instaurar un régimen monárquico en Francia, el auto-proclamado emperador continuó al frente del ejército, logrando cosechar múltiples triunfos gracias a sus brillantes estrategias militares. Victorias que prontamente le permitieron expandir su imperio por casi todo el continente europeo. Un claro ejemplo de su maestría táctica se dio en la batalla de Austerlitz, en la cual las tropas comandadas por Napoleón consiguieron derrotar a las fuerzas rusas y austriacas, a pesar de su inferioridad numérica. Sin embargo, mientras éste conquistaba nuevos territorios y dirigía a sus hombres con absoluta firmeza y valentía, en la privacidad de los grandes pabellones del Palacio de Versalles, el soberano era un individuo completamente inseguro de sí mismo, terco y celoso. Un megalómano adicto al poder, dispuesto a poner en jaque su matrimonio poco ortodoxo con Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) con tal de ampliar su dominio militar y político alrededor del mundo.  Aunque Napoleon se guía por la estructura convencional del film biográfico al mostrarnos los sucesos más relevantes de la vida del comandante convertido en rey en orden cronológico, el director Ridley Scott (Gladiator, The Martian) decide tomar una ruta inusual al explorar y cuestionar el legado de su personaje principal. Si bien las sangrientas batallas son recreadas de forma épica como sólo el realizador sabe hacerlo, la dimensión de éstas no engrandecen ni glorifican sus heroicas hazañas. Al contrario, sus proezas son puestas en tela de juicio al ponderar sobre las cuantiosas pérdidas humanas que dejó cada enfrentamiento y desmitificar su figura de grandeza, nobleza y poderío, la cual, quizá, fue ornamentada por él mismo y aceptada, de generación en generación, como la única verdad absoluta.  Phoenix, quien vuelve a reunirse con Scott luego de haber trabajado juntos hace más de dos décadas, es el cómplice perfecto para acompañarlo y encabezar esta opulenta saga histórica que sobrepasa las dos horas y media de duración. El ganador del premio Oscar sabe cómo tomar las excentricidades de Napoleón Bonaparte e interpretarlas de forma magistral sin caer en la exageración. Ya sea en su faceta como el autoritario y carismático líder, o como el arrogante y precoz marido incapaz de satisfacer las necesidades de su cónyuge, el actor da justo en el clavo y logra cumplir con las complejas demandas de su personaje. Por su parte, la actriz británica Vanessa Kirby complementa la energía de su co-protagonista con una sólida interpretación que inyecta un poco de humor y melancolía al relato. Una historia que además de mostrarnos la naturaleza corruptible del humano, nos recuerda lo difícil que es llegar a la cúspide cuando uno debe iniciar el recorrido desde lo más bajo, enfrentando además a aquellos que buscan proteger su posición en la cima de cualquier amenaza.  Visualmente impactante gracias al trabajo de fotografía y al diseño de vestuario y producción, Napoleon se queda a un paso de obtener la victoria debido a su tono tan irregular. La película va bruscamente de la seriedad de sus secuencias bélicas a la mofa de los irracionales caprichos del protagonista, con un humor reminiscente al de The Favourite y a la serie de televisión The Great, sin hallar ese fino balance armónico entre ambas sintonías. Pese a ello, Napoleon es un espectáculo cinematográfico que vale la pena disfrutarse en la pantalla más grande (el enfrentamiento en Austerlitz por sí solo justifica el precio de admisión). Una cinta que detrás de su pomposa presentación esconde una invitación a cuestionar el verdadero legado de aquellas figuras históricas que, en su afán por alcanzar sus ambiciosas metas e inmortalizarse para siempre en monumentos, lo hicieron a costa de miles de inocentes, quienes sacrificaron sus vidas al seguir y confiar ciegamente en las falsas promesas de sus supuestos líderes. Una historia que doscientos años más tarde continúa repitiéndose.  Napoleon estrena en cines de Estados Unidos a partir del 22 de noviembre del 2023. La película estará disponible vía streaming a través de Apple TV+ en el 2024. "
"Dec 29, 2023",negative," British director Ridley Scott turned 86 on November 30. In a sweet cinematic coincidence, American director Woody Allen turned 88 on the same day. Another American filmmaker, Martin Scorsese, was 81 on Nov. 17. And just to give some attention back to the Brits, Mick Jagger, the frontman for my favorite rock and roll band, The Rolling Stones, turned 80 on July 26. All of this is to state that age is only a number. Do you need more proof? Clint Eastwood is 93-years-old and the upcoming movie he’s directing, “Juror No. 2,” recently resumed production when the SAG-AFTRA strike ended. Scott’s new film “Napoleon” is just settling into theaters. Allen’s 50th feature-length movie as director, “Coup de Chance,” which was shot in Paris, premiered at the Venice Film Festival in September and is currently scoring high with audiences in Europe. It arrives in 2024 in the United States. After six weeks in release, Scorsese’s “Killers Of The Flower Moon” is still playing to appreciative audiences and is a major Academy Award contender. Jagger and the Stones have confirmed tour dates, and they will be singing “Satisfaction” across America next Spring. Not only has Scott proven that a fellow his age has the energy and capability to shoot an epic motion picture with monumental battle scenes – his “Napoleon” was filmed in 2022 from February through May – but he’s also proven to be a cantankerous, high-spirited promoter of his own work. Scott’s “Napoleon” gives truth to the maxim that “you don’t go to the movies to learn history.” The tale of French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte’s rise to power plays fast and loose with the facts. Very fast and very loose. On “60 Minutes,” his thin-skinned responses to criticism of the film were so colorful that the repeated bleeping of vulgar words was necessary. It was clear that he found the whole brouhaha enjoyable. Suffice it to say, the French are apoplectic about Scott’s interpretation of, well, of almost everything in the movie. It’s not just that Bonaparte never fired cannons at the Pyramids in Egypt, something that is shown, but the good that he did for French society is generally ignored. Emperor Napoleon was gifted with a monumental ego, but he also labored hard to build a more equal society in France. The day I walked through the astonishing gilded Palace at Versailles outside Paris, where the wealth of the nation was flagrantly spent by Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, I thought to myself: no wonder the people revolted. Bonaparte’s presence and leadership calmed the country. Before he became ruler, France was in complete and utter chaos. The Reign of Terror was a horrific chapter in the life of France’s citizens. City fought city. Soldiers fought other soldiers. Political edicts voted in by the ruling elite changed hourly. There were so many factions jockeying to lead that it became impossible to know what the laws were. Blood flowed in the streets. The middle-class fought the peasants and the peasants slaughtered the middle-class. Tens of thousands died; many more were imprisoned. The sound of the whoosh of the guillotine was ceaseless. Unfortunately, Scott races through the build-up to the enigmatic Bonaparte’s rise to power because he has only two things he really wants to showcase. They are Napoleon’s wars in which to conquer France’s enemies and his sex life, such as it was. The battle scenes are plentiful. The horrific fighting takes center stage at Austerlitz and Waterloo. Scott goes for spectacular visual sequences, and he delivers. Regarding Napoleon’s marriage to Josephine, I’m not sure who is in a position to confirm what’s put on screen, but it comes across as a relationship that, if true, feels borne out of bitterness and regret. Scott seems obsessed with making some kind of point that the French reputation for romance is a mockery of real love. If we aren’t watching soldiers die in staggering numbers with astonishing, ultra-violent, often grotesque special effects, we’re watching two adults act as if they hated each other from the very first touch. Josephine, played by an acceptable Vanessa Kirby, was a marginal member of the elite. Her first husband was beheaded during the Reign of Terror, and she was temporarily imprisoned; however, it’s clear that Scott sees her as a gold-digger. From what’s on the screen, it’s possible that Napoleon might not have liked Josephine all that much; however, this could be a result of Joaquin Phoenix’s desultory performance as the Emperor. Myth says that Bonaparte had stomach problems and wasn’t much of a hail fellow, well-met type of personality. Phoenix’s acting is glum, and, frankly, leaden. He’s not stoic, which would have been an asset. He’s one-note and dull. Scott reduces the domestic melodrama, which is a major chunk of the belabored 158-minute movie, to what seems like musings from the fragmented mythology we’ve read about Napoleon and Josephine’s manipulative history together. They act like sadomasochistic misfits. David Scarpa’s scattershot screenplay is filled with genuinely bizarre attempts at humor. Scott’s “Napoleon” is a visual and aural choice between the blood of thousands of young men dying or the incessant carping from a married couple. One bright light is the acting from Rupert Everett as the Duke of Wellington. Everett edifies the scenes at Waterloo. The film’s production values are very good, but to what are they in service? Of course, you might want to go for the situation comedy jokes. Bonaparte is by turns gloomy and goofy. He’s quite grandiose when pontificating, none more so than when he says: “Destiny has brought me this lamb chop.” Really Mr. Scott? Really?

"Dec 29, 2023",positive," I said I hoped to get at least two on the list of foreign films I posted last week watched because I wanted to stay conservative while getting to a lot more. Well … I only watched two. One (PERFECT DAYS) because it was a GWNYFCA nominee I needed to finish. The second (THE PROMISED LAND) because someone on my Twitter feed mentioned it—I’m glad they did because I liked it enough to put in my current Top Ten of 2023 (running tomorrow at The Film Stage). The reason I only got to two despite watching more films is that we’re at the stage of the FYC game where expiration dates come into play. Some studios pull access the day of your group’s nominations. Some give you until the end of the year. Some until the end of January. It becomes a juggling act wherein I needed to see the below Sony Pictures Classics titles before Wednesday while having another month to check out IFC’s THE TASTE OF THINGS. I only had three more days to watch NAPOLEON, but an unspecified amount of time to fire up GODLAND. Add the fact I needed to catch four films for final GWNYFCA voting and priorities start to get moved around. Would I ever have considered watching THE ERAS TOUR if it hadn’t been included on our ballot? No. Should it be on the ballot considering it’s a straight concert film and not a documentary? Well, if other members thought it should, then it should. That’s the only prerequisite that matters. It’s a pretty solid list of films again, so definitely take a look if you’re wondering what to watch next. I’m bummed HOW TO BLOW UP A PIPELINE didn’t get more than a breakthrough director nod, but ecstatic ALL OF US STRANGERS snuck into the Best Film race. That’s the beauty of an aggregate vote: most disappointments will be met with a pleasant surprise. A man of faith (Matthew Goode’s C.S. Lewis) visits a dying nonbeliever (Anthony Hopkins’ Sigmund Freud) at the latter’s behest to discuss the existence of God. Did this meeting actually happen? No one knows (the film confirms as much before the credits). But what would they have said if it did? The premise behind Matt Brown’s adaptation of Mark St. Germain‘s play is an intriguing bit speculative fiction wherein they mold what they know about both men into a spirited dialogue. However, since it is all hypothetical, can you ever really supply a concrete truth from the exercise? Can who these men are upon meeting truly change once they say their goodbyes? Not really. The truth we as an audience find is therefore a generic one: mankind is a flawed species that ultimately has no one to blame for its inevitable demise but itself. That’s the one thing these two characters can agree upon, whether it’s a result of there being no God to save us or God simply watching to see if we finally save ourselves. So, despite solid performances and an entertaining script built upon flashbacks that show Freud and Lewis’s own flaws and hypocrisies, the film mostly just moves in circles. It’s a series of “gotchas” that ultimately finishes with a knowing smirk settled upon both men’s faces to mark their enjoyment in the fact that they held their own to not lose the debate … even if no one actually wins it either. It takes about three hours and forty minutes, but Frederick Wiseman finally shows us a moment where chef Michel Troisgros is captivating a table of customers at his Michelin-rated restaurant with the story of his family. We have gleaned a bit of it before then (that oldest son César manages that establishment with his father still very much involved while youngest son Leo manages the family’s second restaurant), but it’s nice to have it laid out with context and detail beyond our assumptions based solely on narrative clues. Before then, MENUS-PLAISIRS - LES TROISGROS is all vibes. The clanking of glasses and clinging of silverware while everyone in the kitchen sautés and sears as orders are called out from the front. Something needs more salt. A plate is missing a component, yet no one is quite sure what beyond its absence. Chefs are working out how to adjust for food allergies (or taste like a client admitting he doesn’t like chocolate). And the organic meat, produce, and wine suppliers give us a brief explanation of their processes (the cheese monger even gives us a tour) to round everything off. This is admittedly my first Wiseman film and I can see why so many people adore his work. Mostly, I can see why PBS adores it since the system-based, fly-on-the-wall documentary aesthetic provided really lends itself to the educational sphere above entertainment. It won’t be for everyone as a result. I personally don’t see a need to dive into the filmmaker’s past works solely based on his involvement. The style complements the scope of his subjects, but it doesn’t necessarily hold itself as a reason to watch on its own. You must be curious about the place and ready for an insane investment of time. My enjoyment came from making fun of the customers and their pantomime of “affluence safely confined to a world of affluence” with no fear of my judgment at the moment of being filmed. I do not see the appeal to ever eat at an establishment like this, but I do totally respect the Troisgros clan as artists and their restaurants as their galleries. So, which one is it? Did Ridley Scott learn from his experience with HOUSE OF GUCCI that forcing bad accents only makes biopics worse? Or does the lack of French accents in NAPOLEON reveal that it was the GUCCI actors who decided to do whatever it was they thought they were doing and he let them? Perhaps it’s simply a product of style and how Scott wanted to deliver the respective comedic tones that run through both—if said tone is intentional, something I must believe since he’s too seasoned and particular a filmmaker for it not to be. He wanted GUCCI to be a cartoon and NAPOLEON the rise and fall of a bratty, boorish idiot. To his credit, both do prove entertaining. Sadly, they also both fail to be much more than that. David Scarpa’s script focusing on Napoleon’s (Joaquin Phoenix is hilarious) life through the prism of his relationship with Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) is an intriguing one considering the letters they wrote to each other (which, as the movie explains, were stolen and sold upon her death). I like the idea that these two were always better together despite their deficiencies where fidelity was concerned and that he ultimately paved his own demise by choosing legacy over love. I don’t, however, think the film does a great job keeping this focus considering Kirby is all but absent for the majority of the second half—a pawn shown in the background or remembered solely through Phoenix uttering her name as he writes about his latest insecurities. Josephine isn’t given enough to make the whole as electric as it is when the two of them are debating the merits of their union in the private and public spheres of their ambition. I wish she were since the rest is rather forgettable. Boring even when it comes to moments like Waterloo’s inevitability (save Phoenix’s always funny petulance). I’ll give Scott credit for the battle on the ice, though. It’s a fantastic scene rivaled only by Phoenix and Kirby goofing around as they portray their characters’ silly flirtations. Maybe Scott will eventually tear down the Oscar-bait-y façade his projects seem unable to relinquish and just make the full-blown farce it seems he so desperately wants. I hope it’s coming so we can reevaluate this current era of his career as a lead-up to its insanity rather than a muddled mess. And if, as rumors say, a four-hour “director’s cut” is released on AppleTV+, I don’t think I’ll watch. Because it’s not 2005. We were deprived of Scott’s vision when KINGDOM OF HEAVEN debuted and subsequently granted the opportunity to see it afterwards. Last I checked it’s 2023 and Apple had the ability to just release what they’re apparently going to release anyway on streaming right away, rendering this cut an intentionally inferior product in the hopes curiosity rather than desire gets viewers to double dip. It’s a potential precedent making me consider whether I should avoid Apple titles altogether. Kôji Yakusho embodies the character of Hirayama with so much personality and childlike awe for the little pleasures in life that we know he’s going to eventually put an “x” somewhere on that tic-tac-toe board he finds tucked away in one of the bathrooms he cleans. This is a man who stops what he’s doing to admire reflections dancing on the ceiling. Who takes pictures of trees with film and revels in the classic rock cassettes he’ll never sell because they aren’t just a fad to him. How can he not choose to make some stranger’s day with a friendly game? This is who director Wim Wenders and co-writer Takuma Takasaki have created to live at the center of their PERFECT DAYS. Hirayama is a creature of routine who takes pride in his life and work regardless of how easy it is for others to dismiss the choices he’s made to build it into what it has become. He doesn’t have to clean public toilets with a meticulousness that can never be preserved due to the fluid nature of the facility itself. After eventually meeting his niece (Arisa Nakano) and sister (Yumi Asô), we can presume he walked away from a charmed existence. But the leaving shouldn’t define him, so we never find out for sure. Nor should we when the film specifically asks us to take Hirayama at face value. It doesn’t matter what his past was or what his future holds. “Now is now.” And while it may look as though he’s alone, he’s not without people who care for him even if it’s just as “the regular customer who gets a glass of water each day.” Hirayama enjoys reading, listening to music, and watering the saplings he finds and relocates to his tiny apartment. But his interests being solitary doesn’t mean he is too. Yes, he hardly talks. But he listens. Watches. Reacts. Young Takashi (Tokio Emoto) could learn a thing or two if he ever fell silent long enough to pay attention. The result is a simple tale of controlled monotony broken up by sharp interludes of intrigue sparked by changes both small (a homeless man not being where he usually is) and large (favors and hiccups steering Hirayama off course). It’s a quietly sweet look at a person unbeholden to the constraints of an ever-evolving society’s demands—a man who knows himself and is comfortable living within the means of that identity. No more. No less. It doesn’t mean he won’t still get sad or frustrated that few join him on that path, though. That’s merely the price he pays for the opportunity to always be surprised. Because no tears Yakusho sheds will ever diminish the warmth of his smile. This one hits hard. And precisely when you least expect it. Because Nikolaj Arcel’s THE PROMISED LAND (adapted by him and co-writer Anders Thomas Jensen from Ida Jessen’s book) is billed as a revenge film pitting Mads Mikkelsen’s poor military captain Ludvig von Kahlen against Simon Bennebjerg’s sadistic nobleman Frederik De Schinkel. While that is what the plot provides for a majority of the runtime, the narrative proves so much bigger. Not in external scope, but in the internal growth of a man beholden to unjust rules. Kahlen has already overcome his peasant status by earning a rank in twenty-five years that men of means receive in just a few months. His hope is to leverage that standing into a chance at more—namely infertile land that Denmark’s king wishes to settle but has yet to bear fruit. So, he makes a deal with the government. If he produces enough yield on his own dime to attract settlers and expand the kingdom, they will give him a title. Kahlen covets that recognition and he will stop at nothing to prove worthy of it. Enter De Schinkel, a cruel landowner who lords over that region precisely because no one can pose a threat without the ability to farm. His power is thus predicated on the heath remaining a wasteland, so he looks to bribe Kahlen into leaving and eventually strong-arm him out when he refuses. Kahlen is a pragmatic idealist who believes if he works within the system, he can ascend within it. De Schinkel is a spoiled brat who knows that his wealth allows him to bend that system to his whims. It’s David vs. Goliath on multiple fronts. But while Mikkelsen is as terrifying as he’s ever been whenever De Schinkel pushes him to the edge of civility, the real fight on-screen is that between Kahlen and himself. Because no matter how unfeeling he wishes he could be to mimic those he wants to treat him as an equal, his past ensures that his shrewdness won’t devolve into malice. It’s not for a lack of trying—he simply cannot work alongside good people long enough to prove De Schinkel and Denmark wrong without endearing himself to them. Without, in some cases, discovering that he loves them too. What at first seems like a bit of added intrigue to the personal land war being waged—kindness and respect for a housekeeper (Amanda Collin’s Ann Barbara) and orphan girl (Melina Hagberg’s Anmai Mus)—soon reveals itself to be the central point. Because Kahlen has a choice to make: become that which he desires at their expense and thus become their undoing or stand up for their humanity and dignity at the expense of his dream. Will he feed into the broken system that abandoned him or rise to become an alternative to it? It’s not a simple question and Kahlen doesn’t automatically choose the correct answer. He tries to straddle the line—doing right by those he should while also not risking his own desires. But half measures only work for the side that doesn’t care if he lives or dies anyway. They’ll destroy those who cannot survive without him giving everything he has. So, the while the path forward leads to violence, the real challenge is showing where that violence comes from. Arcel and company aren’t just satiating our bloodlust in this conflict, they’re dealing with intent. “Need” and “want” are not equal. The beauty of THE PROMISED LAND isn’t in its ability to open our eyes to this reality, but revealing it to Kahlen. We’re watching his brain get rewired as he witnesses the consequences of greed and self-righteousness and awakens himself to the fact own actions are driven by the same sins. It leads to a devastatingly brutal climax before shifting towards an emotional epilogue bringing everything together in the simplest yet most profound way possible by filling the void of tragedy with a wealth of hope. Because a man isn’t a title on a piece of paper. He’s the imprint left upon the hearts of those who love him. From the first scene inside the titular lounge, Ilker Çatak’s film (co-written with Johannes Duncker) portrays how the faculty is just as cliquish and immature as the students. They gossip. They judge. They villainize and conspire. It eventually gets uncomfortable enough that Carla Nowak (Leonie Benesch) tells the assistant principal (Rafael Stachowiak’s Dudek) they need to stop speaking Polish and stick to German so as not to alienate themselves. She’s new to the school after all. This is her first semester and she’s on the outside looking in. She doesn’t yet know that crossing over might take her soul. THE TEACHERS’ LOUNGE starts with a tribunal of sorts. Someone has been stealing money and supplies and, for reasons undisclosed, the staff believes it is a student in Nowak’s class. So, she, Dudek, and Thomas Liebenwerda (Michael Klammer) confront the class’s “representatives”—two students who are in effect singled out to rat on their friends. Nowak does all she can to defend the kids and tell them they don’t have to say anything. Liebenwerda pulls out an attendance list and asks them to nod when he reaches a suspicious name. That’s all it takes to label a child guilty. No proof. No witness testimony. No confession. Just assumption. And one that’s easily negated as far as facts are concerned once the parents get involved. Yet it sticks nonetheless in the court of public opinion. That child is marked now. Being the child of immigrants, he already was. The teachers can apologize or shrug off the effect of such stigmatizations (casting Liebenwerda as a Black actor adds crucial layers to his actions as persecutor throughout the film) all they want, but they don’t truly care. The only one who does is Nowak. Sadly, that knowledge is worthless when you’re on an island alone amongst a group of catty fear-mongers worse than children because their age and “experience” embolden them to believe they have irrefutable authority. It leads Carla to take matters into her own hands by staging a scenario that might allow her to clandestinely catch the real perpetrator in the act. The unfortunate reality of the overall circumstances, however, demand that she involves others after doing so. Others that escalate, confuse, and exacerbate an already tenuous ecosystem. It’s a tense and heartbreaking journey as the ripple effects of what occurs threatens to destroy futures. The psychological damage is immense as accusations are hidden, facts are shrouded by ambiguous language, and rumors are allowed to run rampant. What then is the truth? Is truth even a legitimate concept anymore when half the population has been trained to use opinions and self-satisfying desires as a means to “refute” empirical evidence? And, to make matters more complex, truth should become secondary to the most important aspect of the whole: the safety of children. Nowak might be the lead, but it is young Oskar Kuhn (Leonard Stettnisch) who sits at the center of this drama. His mother (Eva Löbau) wants revenge on the school, using him as a pawn to get it. The school wants blood from the thief who took “hundreds of pencils,” neglecting him to procure it. And then there’s Carla watching the world implode around her best student. Carla, the person who unwittingly started the whole ordeal and now regrets how her role allowed the collateral damage (the kids) to steal control of the narrative and create even more. Benesch is fantastic. The exasperation. The compassion. The guilt of causing pain and the anger that those around her think it was warranted. Even when she tries to do the right thing, those in power deny her so as not to show weakness. To them, sacrificing one kid is worth sweeping it all under the rug. Listening to the loudest voices causes less trouble than listening to the voices of reason. Because, at the end of the day, schools aren’t made for kids. They aren’t built to educate and better society. They’re institutions of capitalism. They babysit so parents can work, training the next generation of workers. So, who cares if one gets left behind? You could turn Jeff Harris’ book about Tenório Júnior into a generic documentary with disembodied voices and archival footage or you could take his numerous recorded interviews and turn them into animated talking heads with Javier Mariscal and Fernando Trueba‘s style from CHICO & RITA giving it an energy to match the Bossa Nova and Samba beats of the era. THEY SHOT THE PIANO PLAYER is thus two things at once: an account of how Harris’ journey to write a book about Brazilian music evolved into a historical account of the disappearance of one of the scene’s been pianists as well as how that shift in perspective evolves into a metaphorical representation of South American life under an ever-increasing blanket of dictatorship. The animation is great. The music is better. And the story is fascinating if only to ensure this revered yet unknown artist outside of the memories of legends doesn’t become completely lost to time. It’s a tragic politically-motivated crime like many that we hear about from that period—the majority of which see the US government as a complicit partner with blood on its hands. Jeff Goldblum playing Harris can be distracting (sometimes I wondered if the filmmakers piped in reaction words for laughs like new scenes beginning with Goldblum just goofily and breathlessly saying “Hello”), but his involvement obviously adds marketability for a subject that might not have gained traction without it. Which is a shame since it is an intriguing bit of convergence between music and politics—another blindly persecuted artist by a totalitarian regime preemptively silencing any potential dissent."
"Dec 27, 2023",negative," “The Holdovers,” directed by Alexander Payne (“The Descendants”) and shot in Massachusetts, took the top prize, best film, and three others: best actor (Paul Giamatti), best supporting actress (Da’Vine Joy Randolph) and best original screenplay (David Hemingson). The crowd-pleasing dramedy stars Giamatti as a bitter boarding-school teacher forced to spend the winter holiday break with students. “The Zone of Interest,” a devastatingly understated Holocaust drama focusing on the everyday family life of Rudolf Hoss (Christian Friedel), commandant of the Auschwitz concentration and death camp, earned three awards: best non-English language film, and best director and best adapted screenplay for Jonathan Glazer (“Under the Skin”). Of all of the award choices, the one that pleased me the most was Lily Gladstone getting best actress for “Killers of the Flower Moon.” To my mind, Gladstone’s less-is-much-much-more work in the epic Martin Scorsese drama was the cinematic highlight of the year (and I said as much during the BSFC discussion). My second favorite winner: Celine Song, best new filmmaker for “Past Lives.” “Killers of the Flower Moon” also picked up awards for best original score (Robbie Robertson) and best editing (Thelma Schoonmaker). Other winners: Ryan Gosling (“Barbie”), best supporting actor; Jonathan Ricquebourg (“The Taste of Things”), best cinematography; “Geographies of Solitude,” best documentary; “The Boy and the Heron,” best animated film; and “Oppenheimer,” best ensemble cast. The BSFC has 25 members, including such noted critics as Ty Burr, Joyce Kulhawik, Gerald Peary, Peter Keough, Betsy Sherman and James Verniere. Dana Barbuto and I serve as the group’s co-presidents. It’s weird: With so many movies to see in such a short amount of time during award season, it doesn’t leave much time for many critics to actually write about them. I know of critics who have taken a vacation week in order to keep up. Sometimes they’ll watch three or four movies – maybe more – in a day. (It’s the same with film festivals, by the way. My record is five in a day – and one of the movies had a running time of over three hours.) After all, there were more than 1,000 films that qualified for BSFC award consideration this year, and it’s not the first time that’s happened. And it all comes to a head in late November/early December, when in-theater advance screenings, and “For Your Consideration” discs and links, arrive like an avalanche.

	Napoleon Bonaparte (1769-1821) was born on the French-owned island of Corsica. At age 16, he graduated from a military school and became an officer in the French army. This biopicture picks up after Napoleon (Joaquin Phoenix) honed his military skills in Europe and Africa and returned to France. He masterminds the defeat of Royalist rebels supported by Anglo-Spanish ships in the city of Toulon. He then rises quickly both in the military and in government.
 
	Napoleon seizes power when a new government is formed in 1799. In 1804, he declares himself emperor in an incredible ornate ceremony. He then embarks on a series of wars to satisfy his gigantic ego and his belief in the military victory as transformative.
 
	Psychiatrists would say that Napoleon exhibits symptoms of narcissistic personality disorder: a grandiose sense of self-importance, a lack of empathy, a willingness to exploit others, frequent envy, and a need for admiration. All these are evident in the film.
 
	Director Ridley Scott, whose films include Gladiator, Robin Hood, and The Last Duel, excels at action sequences, and this movie is full of them. But the story also focuses on Napoleon’s love of Josephine (Vanessa Kirby), his wife and muse. The man’s compulsion to go to war conflicts with his desire to be home with her, especially when he fears she may have affairs. In spiritual terms, his two types of tunnel vision limit his capacity to lead.
 
	“Tunnel vision in a spiritual context refers to a narrow perspective where one is able to see or understand things in a limited or restrictive way. This kind of vision can make us miss out on the bigger picture or other vital aspects of life.
 
	While the film gives us scenes of Napoleon’s victories over Austria, Russia, and Prussia, the objects of his tunnel vision crumble. When Josephine is not able to give him an heir, he divorces her, although they remain in contact. Meanwhile, the French people become exhausted over war and taxes. In 1812, this overconfident dictator leads his troops in an invasion of Russia in which he lost about 80 percent of his men. In 1815, he suffers a final defeat at Waterloo.
 
	A closing screen chronicles the fatalities in the Napoleonic Wars, totaling in the millions. This makes the following quotes from Napoleon about war more to be lamented than emulated.

"Dec 23, 2023",positive," Anyone who has taken a primary school history class knows Napoleon Bonaparte. Even those who don’t know his name should recognize the pint-sized military man with his hand in his jacket pocket. He’s immediately familiar. In fact, it feels almost surprising that Hollywood retellings of his life are so few and far between. So, when Ridley Scott announced Joaquin Phoenix to play the universally recognized historical figure, my mind boggled. Would the pairing harken back to the glory days of Gladiator? Or would the result be simply another flat and utterly mediocre historical drama?  Napoleon traces the life of the General and French Emporer of the time (Joaquin Phoenix) charting his rise to military power, through his relationship with (the love of his life) Josephine (Vanessa Kirby). Ridley Scott directs the movie from a script by David Scarpa.  Napoleon hits theaters with big and lofty goals. This story covers a lot of complicated, but oft-explored history during its two-and-a-half-hour runtime. Like many Ridley Scott films, there is a lot going on here through all levels of production.  To begin with, Napoleon is a veritable feast for the eyes. Every frame is stylistically gorgeous and looks like “a million bucks”.  Ultimately, this should come as no surprise. Ridley Scott stands among the greatest filmmakers of the last half-century. He gave us Blade Runner, for crying out loud.  In fact, it makes perfect sense that the director who brought us Gladiator would bring a movie with such vivid and operatic battle sequences. These moments, which are scattered throughout the runtime are most certainly the cinematic high point. The peak is likely The Battle of Austerlitz. The sequence is stark and harsh, but at the same time, beautifully atmospheric. The seasoned and wily filmmaking, when brought together with a borderline unhinged performance from Joaquin Phoenix, results in a magnetic sequence. It’s difficult to tear your eyes away from everything happening on-screen.  However, this all sets up a strange and wacky second act. All of a sudden, Napoleon is layered. Phoenix is playing to the cheap seats. Napoleon is even perhaps, kinky? Who would have imagined that?  In fact, for this portion of the movie, his casting feels to be a reflexive comment on Napoleon as a human being. Phoenix’s performance brings more than the occasional reminder of his work in Gladiator. This character may be a majestic leader, but he’s still a simpering, yet petulant manchild. This is a brave choice that flies in the face of how we often remember historical figures.  At the same time, Napoleon becomes yet another work in a long line of films to commit a cardinal sin: underutilizing Vanessa Kirby. Since the actress burst on the scene in The Crown, she’s been heralded as one of the best of her generation. However, she keeps finding herself in movies that don’t know how to use her talents. This is yet another.  Ultimately, strong world-building is Napoleon‘s true selling point. Ridley Scott unsurprisingly puts forward a visually stunning feature. It looks as rich and vivid as this history should be. However, this is largely a case of style over substance. While there are interesting moments involving these characters, nothing gels into anything cohesive. There are many flashes of brilliance, but their depictions pale in comparison to the beauty of the world-building.  A film nerd from my earliest years watching Abbott and Costello, that eventually translated to a Master’s Degree in Film History. I spend my time working on my fiction projects in all their forms, as well as covering film and television."
"Dec 23, 2023",positive," Only Ridley Scott might have taken on a project as ambitious as Napoleon and avoided embarrassment. If he doesn’t entirely succeed this may be because the subject is simply too vast, too complex, to be crammed into two-and-a-half hours. There are thousands of books on Napoleon (1769-1821), with new ones being published every other month. Every campaign, every letter, every aspect of his private life or personality, has been scrutinised by professional historians and enthusiastic amateurs. Keep reading and rather than becoming more familiar, he only grows more mysterious. In both public and private, Napoleon is a wealth of contradictions: a hero of the Enlightenment and a relentless war-mongerer; a champion of the Revolution who reinstated an absolute monarchy; an aesthete, who found time to attend operas and plays in the midst of a campaign; a romantic who divorced the only woman he truly loved, in the quest for an heir and strategic alliance; a dedicated technocrat who gave France a code of laws, an education system, an improved postal service, roads and public works, but felt that only martial glory would secure his legacy. Will the real Napoleon ever stand up? A provincial upstart from Corsica, he never overcame his lingering insecurities, even when all the kings of Europe were cowering at his feet. His brilliance as a tactician and his long record of military success made him acutely resistant to the advice and opinions of his allies. Like the narcissist he was, regardless of what all the world might be telling him, Napoleon would trust his own judgement. What’s amazing is that it worked – allowing him to pull off miraculous victories as a general and a politician – until his ”star” deserted him and all his calls went wrong. To a greater extent than possibly anyone else in history, Napoleon’s rise and fall were entirely self-generated. As may be imagined, such a figure creates unique challenges for the director who wants to bring him to the screen, and the actor who plays the role. Although there have been numerous cinematic portrayals of Napoleon, the greatest is probably Abel Gance’s silent epic of 1927. The restored version of Gance’s Napoleon clocks in at roughly five hours and leaves off at the point where the young general is establishing his reputation with his early Italian campaigns. Gance originally planned to make six films on Napoleon, but because the first was released at a time when the film industry was switching to ‘talkies’, his masterpiece stumbled at the box office, and the grand scheme lapsed. In Scott’s Napoleon, the Italian campaigns are disposed of in a sentence. They happened somewhere off camera while we weren’t looking. What we get instead is the ambitious young commander who led the successful seige of Toulon, suddenly challenging for the top job in a post-revoutionary France that badly needs someone to restore order and confidence. We’ve also skipped Napoleon’s childhood in Corsica, his complex family connections, his time at the military academy, and most of the machinations that would see him installed as one of three Consuls who took control of the country in 1799 in a popular coup d’état. In no time at all, he is supreme ruler. It was a meteoric rise to power, but in this film it happens in the blink of an eye. The only early campaign we see is his occupation of Egypt, which was generally disastrous but portrayed as a triumph, thanks to Napoleon’s masterly understanding of propaganda. These scenes allow Scott to include sweeping views of the Pyramids, and a strange vignette in which Napoleon goes face-to-face with the mummy of a Pharaoh, who looks suspiciously like Ramses the Great. OK, point taken. In place of an origin story, we get a whiff of cinematic fantasy, beginning with the beheading of Marie Antoinette, which Napoleon watches impassively, a mere face in the crowd. Historians have been quick to point out he wasn’t in Paris at the time, and to list massive inaccuracies in every detail of the execution. In this preface to the story, Scott and his scriptwriter, David Scarpa, are announcing that they are prepared to take serious liberties with the historical record. These liberties will continue until the very end, with more campaigns and personal battles being left on the cutting room floor, including the final conflicts following Napoleon’s disastrous Russian campaign that will lead to his abdication. In this version he’s back from Russia and instantly signing the paper. The big question is whether these savage cuts and rearrangements ruin the film. Historical purists have already cast their verdict in unequivocal fashion, but Scott and Scarpa might argue they were making a movie rather than a history lesson. They have taken their stand on two points: the major battles that defined Napoleon’s career; and the relationship with his wife, Josephine, that provides the most acute insights into his personality. There may be nobody in the industry who does battle scenes as brilliantly as Ridley Scott. Napoleon fought 61 major engagements, of which only a handful are covered in this film, but the scenes of Austerlitz and Waterloo are gripping and dramatic. Soldiers are mowed down by cannon balls; men and horses disappear under the ice of a frozen river in billowing clouds of blood. Combatants hack at each other with swords and bayonets or are blown away by close range musket fire. It’s breathless entertainment, and it feels horribly real. As for the marriage of Napoleon and Josephine, it sets huge challenges for the lead actors, Joaquin Phoenix and Vanessa Kirby. The first obstacle to credibility is that Josephine was significantly older than Napoleon, who married her when he was 30 years old and she 36. Phoenix at 49, is 13 years older than Kirby. We need to accept that Phoenix’s weatherbeaten countenance will be the same, whether he is supposed to be in his 20s or his 50s. The onus is on the actor to make us forget about age and believe wholeheartedly in his rendition of the character. Josephine cheated on Napoleon in the very first days of their marriage, acting as if she was very far from being in love with this Corsican “brute”. He was the opposite, declaring himself smitten from their initial meeting. For the rest of their lives, even after he had divorced her for largely political reasons, Napoleon seems to have remained in love with his errant, extravagant wife. The scene where they sit down together upon his return from Egypt, to confront her infidelity, is one of the highlights of the script, as Josephine deftly swings the balance of power in her direction. Whatever she felt at the beginning of the liaison, she and Napoleon will become the firmest of couples, each necessary to the other. Although the merits of this film are being contested in terms of its historical accuracy, it lives or dies on the performance of Joaquin Phoenix, who bears little physical resemblance to Napoleon. Conscious of the puzzles within the great man’s personality, Phoenix has chosen to play him as an introvert, hiding his own insecurities behind a mask of indifference. He is grumpy and troubled, devoted to his official duties, tortured by a sense of destiny. One imagines the real Napoleon was more mercurial, with the charm and intelligence to get his way in almost every encounter. Nevertheless, Phoenix has pitched his tent on a particular version of Napoleon and remains consistent from start to finish. We may not like this portrayal of Napoleon, or believe in its accuracy, but as a display of the actor’s craft it’s a job well done. It’s tempting to say the same about Ridley Scott – a consummate professional among contemporary directors; an old hand, equally at home with a battle scene involving thousands of extras, and an intimate tête-à-tête between husand and wife. For any director, Napoleon might be seen as a lunatic enterprise, as ambitious and overreaching as the emperor’s belief in his own starry destiny. But while it’s impossible not to have reservations about this film, it’s equally impossible to avoid being impressed. Scott has given us a magnificent, flawed epic, with a lead actor strapped into the character like a pilot in his cockpit. I occasionaly gasped when I realised how much history was being omitted but got caught up in the flow as Napoleon surged inexorably towards his fate. Perhaps the best approach may be to forget about the facts and enjoy the sheer effrontery of the fiction."
"Dec 23, 2023",positive," The script, by David Scarpa (“All the Money in the World”), dutifully takes us from high point to high point, as Napoleon Bonaparte rises through the ranks during the French Revolution and after, taking advantage of the chaos brought by the guillotine and the “Reign of Terror” to position himself as a strongman. Ultimately, in a country that just got rid of its king, Napoleon works himself into the job of emperor. Early on, Napoleon meets a noblewoman recently sprung from the Bastille — Joséphine de Beauharnais (Vanessa Kirby). Their story isn’t the fairy-tale romance, since Joséphine had other lovers while Napoleon was away shooting cannons at the Egyptian pyramids and such. Napoleon’s attitude toward Joséphine is more of a spoiled child, jealous and sniveling, than ostensibly the most powerful man in Europe. Things come to a head when Napoleon pressures Joséphine to bear him a son and heir. Phoenix’s performance is a curious mix of bravado and petulance, capturing both his military smarts and his personal foibles. He’s nicely matched by Kirby, who quietly manages her emperor’s mercurial moods with a diplomatic tone and a tigress’ purr.  Much of Scott’s movie focuses on Napoleon’s military prowess and his hubris — both in his invasion of Russia, where he started with 600,000 soldiers and limped home with 40,000, and the climactic battle of Waterloo, where he was completely outclassed in tactics by the Duke of Wellington (Rupert Everett). It’s in those battle scenes where “Napoleon” earns our attention. There are few directors still working who can bring the spectacle, the sheer bigness of a war epic like this, the way Scott does. He makes every cannon blast hit home."
"Dec 20, 2023",negative,"The movie plods along until his inevitable death in 1921, and there doesn't seem to be a point to showing the story at all. Which makes we wonder, why did I bother?"
"Dec 19, 2023",negative," As I was watching Ridley Scott’s Napoleon, written by David Scarpa, I gradually became aware that I was sitting in a dark room watching an image of actors pretending to be Napoleon (Jaoquin Phoenix) and Josephine (Vanessa Kirby). Not a good sign when the trailer promised triumph after action-packed triumph. In fact, the film does open on a thrilling battle: the lifting of the Siege of Toulon in 1793, a few years into the Revolution. Granted his first command, Napoleon’s diligent reconnaissance led him to formulate a daring midnight raid to capture the British fort there and turn it against their own ships. (I should note at this point that the film plays very loose with historical accuracy.) The plan is explained to us beforehand, the camera direction is clear and consistent, and we get a sense of Napoleon’s nerves before he charges into battle himself. None of that ever reappears in the rest of the film. What is repeated, however, are Napoleon’s bathetic close-combat skills (stunts coordinated by Natalie Wood) — complete with panting (sound designed by Michael Fentum) — the gore, here of a cannonball shot directly into his horse (VFX supervised by Illia Afanasiev), and the twisted humor of when, after the battle, he reaches into his horse’s corpse, pulls out the cannonball, and tosses it to younger brother Lucien (Matthew Needham), saying, “Send this to Mother” (SFX supervised by Neil Corbould). If the whole film had been like either the previous paragraph or the one above it, an excellent time would have been had by all. Alas, a ridiculous man though this Napoleon is — with his American accent among a sea of British voices (Rupert Everett’s Duke of Wellington is the most British of the lot) and the indeterminate European accent of Edouard Philipponnat’s Tsar Alexander I (casting by Kate Rhodes James) — the film still feels the need to give its scarecrow a heart. That would be Kirby’s Josephine, Napoleon’s first wife and lifelong beloved. She enters the film being noticed and pursued by Napoleon, and though she immediately sees what a silly man he is, even laughing in his face, she’s a widowed former aristocrat who needs security. So she marries him and, as she doesn’t take him seriously, very publicly takes a lover while he’s busy shelling the Pyramids of Giza. Big mistake. Napoleon’s juvenile jealousy comes crashing down on her head, and using some emotional blackmail he makes her take him seriously. Thenceforth, she endures being his love object, sometimes even wringing some fun out of it, as seen in one breakfast scene cribbed from Amadeus (1984). At least, that’s what it looks like onscreen. Curiously, their love letters seem to tell an entirely different story. As heard in voiceover when Napoleon’s off fighting Russia, he’s still a jealous power-bottom, but Josephine responds with equal passion. Phoenix and Kirby are both outstanding actors, and their dynamic is clear when the script is. But most of the time, we’re not quite sure where they stand. Who’s in charge? Who’s humoring whom? Unlike in, say, Scenes from a Marriage (1973), this relationship doesn’t feature dialectical reversals, just a precarious woman trying to fulfill the expectations of her powerful and impossibly fickle husband. Napoleon’s dithering is his secret weapon. Good things come to him: the command at Toulon, the enemy into his trap at Austerlitz, an offer to join the Coup of 18 Brumaire, the throne itself. It’s when the film lets him actively choose that he suffers: Josephine and her infertility necessitating divorce, the doomed winter march on Moscow leading to exile on Elba, Waterloo where he takes the initiative in attacking. The coup itself is a good example. It’s offered to him, and he accepts. But on the day, when he tries to take the Council rostrum, the Council members heckle and beat him to within an inch of his life. Pratfalling down the steps, he narrowly escapes outside, where Lucien is waiting to seal the deal with a troop of gendarmes. What follows is high-stakes improv to justify military intervention, including some intuitive fraternal chemistry and the crucial use of a sword. Napoleon, who re-enters to ask, “Shall we vote?” may have rifles at his back, but he’s lost all face. That’s why he’s, once again, panting. Since the subject of this biopic has no center, the film’s stance is unclear, and so the technical side feels muddled. Not knowing what to emphasize, the pacing drags (edited by Claire Simpson and Sam Restivo). Dariusz Wolski’s cinematography is underlit, so that even the setup for the Battle of Austerlitz is hard to comprehend. The CGI for the winter camp at Austerlitz and the burning of Moscow (by Alexander himself, the film reminds us) looks cheap. And so many comedic moments fall flat due to lackluster execution, with the major exception of the slapstick coup scene."
"Dec 19, 2023",positive,Dariusz Wolski’s camera work on battle scenes is spectacular.
"Dec 15, 2023",negative," For a film with as many contradictions as Napoleon, it’s odd for it to be so straightforward. It covers 28 years, but it never feels like a lot of changes. It’s over two and a half hours, which, while not a herculean runtime, never entirely slows down. Perhaps it’s because it never really gets started. Ridley Scott’s latest opens with a public decapitation of Marie Antoinette (Catherine Walker), giving way to the 1793 Siege of Toulon. The violence is often unsparingly graphic, so why, then, does it feel so cosmetic? Shouldn’t a live horse eviscerated by a cannonball to the chest do something to the viewer? Maybe not when there’s such little context. If Napoleon is one thing, it’s episodic—ahistorical, even. David Scarpa’s script begins in the trenches and is content on staying there. Everyone and everything are simply window dressing. That includes Napoleon Bonaparte himself (Joaquin Phoenix), whom the film oversimplifies from intrinsically flawed leader to wholly externalized man-child. After the Siege, he wins the affections of Joséphine de Beauharnais (Vanessa Kirby). The two soon marry. It’s a relationship of manipulation and droll humor the film isn’t bothered to get invested in. Napoleon often works as a vessel for war scenes, with the rest as connective tissue. It ostensibly follows Bonaparte’s rise and fall until his death in 1821, but given how the film’s intermittent structure prevents it from accruing any momentum, there is no true ascent, much less a crash. It sees its characters as circumstantial. Worse yet, its interest in the politics surrounding them borders on nonexistent. Acid spit would be one approach to this story, as Scott and Scarpa seem to aim for at points, but they settle for ambivalence. Instead, Scott livens up Napoleon on a strictly macroscopic level. The violence itself is inherently upsetting if unmoving in context, but Scott and cinematographer Dariusz Wolski’s mise en scène exists just at the cusp of something grandiose. Their work is often layered in composition, propulsive in motion, while stoic in staging. It’s never momentous, but in some ways, that’s appropriate. Only in such moments does Napoleon balance its technical bombast with the fatalistic bent of its story. Meanwhile, Arthur Max’s production design remains up to snuff, even if Scott often isolates it from the characters at hand. There’s a bizarre lack of setting to the whole experience. Rather, the actors exist on their own planes physically and emotionally. Phoenix oscillates between hamming it up and folding into a demeanor that hints at a more destructive pathos, and while his work gels with the film’s humorous streak, it renders the character lost in his own story. Conversely, Kirby does good work with a role the film doesn’t care for. She manages to excavate a cleverness from Joséphine’s past—which, again, the movie bypasses—grounding moments that otherwise edge on self-parody in the process. And yet, against all odds and flaws, Napoleon isn’t particularly dull despite being a 158-minute passive viewing experience. The editing from Claire Simpson and Sam Restivo maintains a coherence to the more spectacular moments but allows the runtime to putter along. Alas, it’s easy to see what could have been: the class commentary, the fatalism of it all, the metaphor of the male ego vis-à-vis the historical epic itself. Scott has mentioned the existence of a 270-minute director’s cut. It’s not a satiating prospect, but one must wonder how much substance got the axe before coming to its theatrical form here. The end title cards list the increasing death tolls from Bonaparte’s battles, which point to something pointedly cold—grim, even. But Napoleon lacks the work to stick that landing, faltering as an epic and a character piece. It’s one thing for a movie to not care for human insight. It’s another for it to fail to engage with conflict in any meaningful way, inside or out.

"Dec 14, 2023",negative,"It’s clear, I think, that in spite of various attempts to make Napoleon work as a biopic, the film doesn’t have a bio. It has a general of genius, something like a sports figure who is alive only in games or tournaments."
"Dec 14, 2023",positive,Epic battle scenes but the personal story is lacking.
"Dec 13, 2023",positive,It feels as if Scott is flipping the bird to a film industry that takes itself too seriously.
"Dec 13, 2023",neutral," Ridley Scott's Napoleon attempts to capture both the epic military achievements and personal relationships of one of history's most powerful figures, starring Joaquin Phoenix as the French emperor and Vanessa Kirby as Empress Josephine. Known for his prowess in historical dramas, Scott's latest endeavor falls short in grasping the complexity of Napoleon's rise and fall. The film delves into the events that shaped Napoleon's trajectory, offering a reductive, almost anecdotal vision of his life. While the rough combat scenes stand out as the film's most attractive aspect - the bloody battles against the Russians are potentiated by gloomy undertones and Martin Phipps’ tenebrous score - the overall narrative comes across as disjointed and superficial.  Even cinematically rewarding in terms of carefully framed shots (the evocative cinematography is by Dariusz Wolski), what we experience is lifelessness. Phoenix's portrayal of Napoleon oscillates between bravery and vulnerability, mirroring the film's own conflicted nature. The lack of a personal perspective also prevents the film from delving into something bolder.  To make matters worse, Phoenix and Kirby have no chemistry, and the film's energy fizzles out before reaching its conclusion. Abel Gance successfully tackled Napoleon's story in 1927, but Scott's adaptation is another missed opportunity to explore the complexities of France's most significant military commander and historical ruler."

"Dec 12, 2023",neutral," Ridley Scott is one of the cinematic kings of visual spectacle, and in that sense, his biopic “Napoleon” is on par with anything he’s ever made. However, he’s apparently got a four-hour director’s cut of “Napoleon” coming out on Apple TV+ in the next few months. And so my recommendation—unless you’re a diehard Napoleon fan with miniature Napoleonic battlefields in your basement and secretly enjoy wearing a replica of Emperor Bonaparte’s black felt bicorn hat (the one that just sold for $2.1 million at an auction in France last Sunday)—is that you stay away from the current 2.5-hour theatrical version. Why? It’s a crashing bore. It’s a chronically under-lit, funereal-toned, dour-performances-packed nonhistory lesson. I mean, there’s a scene where Napoleon blows the top off Egypt’s Great Pyramid of Giza with a cannonball. And then opens up some golden sarcophagus (Pharoah Khufu, was it?) and sniffs the mummy, and pokes old Khufu in his parched face. Yeah, sure, that happened. Beginning in 18th-century France, with the reek of the rabid revolution in the air, Corsican gunnery officer Napoleon Bonaparte (Joaquin Phoenix) ambles around with his hands behind his back, surveying troops and contemplating how to beat the British. The first battle scene is 1793’s Siege of Toulon. Director Scott, who delights in destroying the human chest by having aliens explode out of it, here explodes Napoleon’s trusty steed’s chest via a baseball-sized cannonball. Not since Roland Emmerich’s “The Patriot” has the grotesqueness of a cannonball strike had such a  ghastly depiction. It must be said, the cannons should here be nominated for an Oscar—they’re a character unto themselves, a kind of Greek (cannon) chorus. But as with Marie Antoinette’s chopped top, I didn’t really care to contemplate that much carnage. A closing-card tells us that Napoleon fought in 61 campaigns. Five of these battles are showcased for the film. In addition to Toulon, there are the aforementioned 1798 Battle of the Pyramids, 1812’s Battle of Borodino, 1805’s Battle of Austerlitz, and finally the infamous 1815 Battle of Waterloo, where Duke of Wellington Arthur Wellesley (Rupert Everett) defeats the legendary Frenchman. Napoleon’s battles generally had a success rate of 80 percent, and the man left some three million souls dead under his command. Imagine killing three million people. Vanessa Kirby, best known from the “Mission Impossible” franchise, makes for a tempestuous, unfaithful, and possibly possessed Joséphine. We learn that she is a woman with needs, and when her “Corsican Ruffian” husband leads his army off to the Ottoman territory of Egypt, she’s fooling around with a dashing young courtier. Which leads to Napoleon dropping everything and rushing home, comically, to see if, after having been massively cuckolded, he can shed that snakeskin of shame. All of France is aware of the situation, after all. When Joséphine then queries as to whether her husband has had affairs too, he responds with, “Of course,” as if a man of his power is so entitled. It’s one of many double standards that Joséphine has to learn to deal with over the course of their marriage. Historians have suggested that Napoleon lacked sexual energy. But here the interpretation is that he’s quite energetic but entirely self-involved, which is funny, and Mr. Phoenix obviously enjoys the concept, sending up Napoleon by stomping his feet, whinnying like a horse, and champing at the bit to convey his fervent matrimonial intentions. One imagines that the missing connective tissue here is within director Scott’s four-hour version, and this contributes to the tone jumping around so much and the lack of overarching cohesion in how the character is depicted. Which, again, give the comedic bits more of the effect of a Mel Brooks-style satire, instead of supporting a classic Ridley Scott historical epic. But because Mr. Scott’s satirical take is also clearly intentional, casting Joaquin Phoenix and his zany theatrical choices makes sense. Mr. Phoenix’s stock-in-trade, after all, are disturbed men, often with sexual issues. Personally, I’d rather not link one of the greatest warriors history has ever produced with Mr. Phoenix’s über-creep, “The Joker,” in my mind, but I don’t know enough Napoleonic history to be able to tell if his is even a remotely valid interpretation. My guess is no. Vanessa Kirby, on the other hand, takes a more grounded approach to the material. And while this does help the audience relate to her more fully from an emotional standpoint, it also makes it feel as if Ms. Kirby and Mr. Phoenix are in two completely different movies. And this is all well and good if such a stand-alone, fictitious creation produces a good lesson to be learned—advice that audiences can take away, a moral to the story. What’s the lesson in “Napoleon”? While I was able, as always, to appreciate Ridley Scott’s technical virtuosity and painterly eye, I didn’t care about any of the characters involved, or have even a minimal personal investment in their outcomes. As was mentioned at the outset, by his own admission, this cinematic rendering of “Napoleon” is literally only half of what Mr. Scott originally intended, so the fact that the whole thing comes off as half-cocked is hardly a surprise. And so, while there’s nothing immediately apparent to be found here, the lesson in “Napoleon” may yet be forthcoming in the four-hour version. But I also have to say, after having seen the two-hour film, I have zero interest in the four-hour one."
"Dec 12, 2023",positive," NOW IN THEATERS! Ridley Scott is an unstoppable machine. He pit Sigourney Weaver against an alien in 1979; now, 44 years – and many classics – later, he pits Joaquin Phoenix against the world in the epic Napoleon. Choosing broad brushstrokes over intricate details, Scott and screenwriter David Scarpa attempt to condense the titular character’s entire complex life into a two-and-a-half-hour narrative. The result, while flawed, is glorious: majestic, atmospheric, visually stunning, led by two charismatic leads. Scott, at 86, shows the young ‘uns how it’s done. The narrative begins in 1793, when a young Napoleon (Joaquin Phoenix), still an officer, observes Queen Marie Antoinette (Catherine Walker) beheaded by a guillotine. Soon, he proves himself to Paul Barras (Tahar Rahim), a politician and revolutionary leader, by fighting off the British, followed by a series of battle victories, executed with ease and finesse. Ambitious from a young age, Napoleon does not even attempt to hide his overinflated ego nor his grand aspirations. He finds himself entranced by Joséphine de Beauharnais (Vanessa Kirby), a coquettish widow; before long, they get married. Her public infidelity drives Napoleon to abandon his troops in Egypt after winning the Battle of the Pyramids. Yet he does not divorce Joséphine – not yet, at least. Her inability to birth him an heir eventually leads to the collapse of their marriage. Scott’s film may be overstuffed and unwieldy, but it’s also never boring and unexpectedly hilarious. He and Scarpa zoom through major historical events: Napoleon’s coronation, the Battle of Austerlitz, the Battle of Borodino, the failed invasion of Russia, the battle of Waterloo, and Napoleon’s exile. Interestingly, the filmmakers focus more on the central relationship, some of the explosive film’s most powerful scenes involving the two leads quietly exploring their power dynamics, the nuances of their weirdly symbiotic relationship. Phoenix is magnetic, per usual, utterly inhabiting the central character while avoiding the pitfalls of playing a larger-than-life personality. In fact, he goes in the opposite direction, that of introspection, which renders his performance that much more enigmatic. Kirby, too, sidesteps the usual clichés of a female supporting character in a predominantly male feature, not only holding her own but forming the heart of the otherwise steely affair. Also, thank heavens they didn’t de-age them for the earlier sequences; I’d rather buy into a 49-year-old Phoenix playing a 24-year-old Napoleon than be distracted by the pixels all over his face. The battle sequences are, of course, jaw-dropping in scope. Legendary cinematographer Dariusz Wolski’s camera glides over dark-green hills or foggy wintry terrain, eyeing the clashing armies with a perfectly calibrated balance of indifference and reverence. (One particular instance with a horse is bound to get the audience riled up.) The battle of Austerlitz, with its bombardment of a frozen lake, may mark the standout, for it’s not the exploding ice that astounds the most – it’s Bonaparte’s eyes, viewing the destruction with the mix of pride and nonchalance that Wolski captures so well. The film explores what drove Napoleon, avoiding gimmicks or easy targets (it never even mentions his height): his ego, his love of his people and country – and, of course, Joséphine – and, well, something else, something that Phoenix leaves for interpretation. He’s both kind and heartless, devoted and self-absorbed. It’s definitely not your typical portrayal of a famous historical figure, and the better for it. According to IMBD, the director has over 68 titles in development. The man has long since set the standard for how it’s done. He continues to challenge himself, studying fascinating historical figures, venturing into outer space, and exploring the family dynamics of a notorious fashion mogul. Gladiator 2? Bring it on.

"Dec 8, 2023",neutral," On this episode, JD and Brendan discuss Ridley Scott’s latest film Napoleon, starring the strangely hilarious Joaquin Phoenix! It does appear, sadly that this is another Kingdom of Heaven situation for Ridley Scott as we do know that a 4-hour version is coming to AppleTV soon. The theatrical cut has its limitations and we do our best to talk about what those are here, and what we hope for in the final version."
"Dec 8, 2023",neutral," Over two decades after they worked together on Gladiator (yes, it really was that long ago) Ridley Scott and Joaquin Pheonix reunite on this big-screen biopic of the famously vertically challenged general (it’s called a ""Napoleon complex"" for a reason!) Even if you slept through history in school, you are likely aware of at least some facets of the French Emperor's life - thanks in part to a certain Eurovision-winning song by ABBA. But, obviously, there’s more to the man than an award-winning floor filler, and here Scott tries to capture the essence of Napoleon while also revelling in the spectacle of his military leadership. Spectacle is something that Scott does well, and Napoleon is no exception. He recreates six of the warmonger's most famous conflicts (yes, including that one) in gruesome and gory detail. The scenes are bloody and not for the squeamish. War is always brutal but when it’s conducted on horseback with swords and 19th-century weapons it seems even more visceral, especially when experienced in IMAX (which I did). But there is more to the man than his military career and, outside of the complex battle scenes, the focus is on the man behind the uniform. At the Crux of the story is his relationship with his beloved Josephine played by Vanessa Kirby, who you may know from The Crown and Mission: Impossible. From the moment Napoleon sets eyes on his beloved, he becomes obsessed. And their volatile and passionate relationship is seemingly only marred by the fact that she can’t bear him a son and heir. At 157 minutes long this epic is a marathon - not a sprint (maybe don’t order the large drink). It takes us from Napoleon’s mid-twenties up to his death at the age of 51. Despite the quarter of a century time frame there appears to be no attempt made to de-age Pheonix however, which sometimes feels jarring. Kirby gives a magnetic performance as Josephine and makes it easy for viewers to see why the general would fall for her. Unfortunately, much of the depiction of their relationship wouldn’t be out of place in a Carry On film (they actually never made Carry On Napoleon but it feels like it would have been a good fit in the franchise). While he never uttered the famous ""not tonight Josephine"" phrase attributed to him, ""every night Josephine"" would be far more fitting as the saying ""at it like rabbits"" springs to mind. Despite this, there is never anything erotic about their encounters, and their relationship feels cold rather than passionate. This is not the fault of the actors. They are saddled with clunky dialogue from writer David Scarp. Pheonix portrays Napoleon as somewhat boorish and buffoonish. It would seem unlikely that the real Napoleon exhibited these traits predominately, given his success in both the military and political fields. As a result, the Oscar-winning actor's take on the character makes him almost cartoonish. I found myself looking at my watch (never a good sign) until it got to that battle, with now elder statesman Rupert Everett brilliantly cast as the Duke of Wellington. Running through the ABBA song in my head (I of course mean Waterloo and I defy you not to sing it to yourself when that scene comes on screen) I surmised that ""Napoleon did surrender"" and therefore the movie must be almost over. After that, the film trundles on for another few minutes but indeed the end is nigh for our (anti?) hero at this point. After so much pomp and splendour, his on-screen death while in exile on the Island of St Helena is anticlimactic. This should probably come with the disclaimer ""based on true events"". Asked to defend the historical accuracy of it by the BBC Scott asked historians: “Were you there? Oh, you weren’t there. Then how do you know?” But it doesn’t really take a historian to appreciate that a lot of liberty’s have been taken here. Equally, it doesn’t take a psychiatrist to know that Scott barely scratches the surface of Napoleon’s psyche. Seemingly there is a four-hour cut that is due to land on Apple TV at some point. This may fill in some of the gaps, but, until then, this is a gloriously epic tale that appears to be more “inspired by” its eponymous hero than firmly rooted in fact. Vanessa Kirby and Catherine Walker (in a very brief appearance as Marie Antoinette at the beginning of the movie) are both wonderful. Unfortunately, Phoenix completely hams it up, turning Napoleon into somewhat of a caricature. Visually spectacular but emotionally unfulfilling - this deserves a watch as a well-crafted piece of cinema rather than beautifully woven storytelling. Which is a shame."
"Dec 8, 2023",negative," ""Napoleon,"" a technically impressive epic with grandiose battle sequences featuring gritty set designs and legions of miserable-looking extras, is a 158-minute roast of the titular historical figure whose 60 battles throughout his two decades in power have been boiled down to six of Scott and writer David Scarpa's choosing. The inclusion of Waterloo, the battle that marked the end of the Napoleonic Wars, was obvious. The Battle of Austerlitz was another jazzy win for the French leader with an incredible sequence that found Napoleon Bonaparte (Joaquin Phoenix) dunking his foes in the frozen water as they attempted to retreat. But the battle that takes up a majority of the film's attention is Napoleon's turbulent relationship with his wife Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) whose erratic behavior, frequent infidelity and inability to provide him an heir was enough drama to be a full-time job. Napoleon was no Casanova, at least not according to Phoenix's portrayal and Scarpa's writing who attribute the emperor's rise as a result of the tumultuous post-revolution landscape and good, ol' fashion right-place, right-time. Napoleon had some impressive military operations — the movie portrays a few of them — but they are undercut by his spoiled, schoolboy obsession with his wife.  ""Napoleon"" opens with the gruesome execution via guillotine of the infamous French queen Marie Antoinette, a seminal event in the French Revolution and one that marked an opportunity for Napoleon, then a scheming military strategist and war general, to gain popularity and seize political power. He finally crowned himself emperor in 1804, a ceremony portrayed in the film with a reckless tyrant throwing tradition aside and pulling the crown over his own head, a symbol of his unyielding control of France. On paper, it sounds thoughtful and powerful. In Phoenix's hands, the scene is a gag, and Napoleon is another over-indulgent, petulant royal.  Told through letters to Josephine, ""Napoleon"" does do an incredible job with setting the scene, drawing audiences into the epic battles Napoleon fought throughout his career. The battlefield sequences are brutal. Audience members can almost taste the mud that flicks up after the horses. The rudimentary quarters for the commanding emperor wreak of bodily stink and misery. ""Napoleon"" thrives under Scott's ability to command his own army of camera operators, set creators and the thousands of workers to bring the scenes to excruciatingly visceral life.  Unfortunately, the film is far more interested in the dramatic and mercurial relationship between the lead and his much older wife who had been previously widowed with two children than it is in deep diving into the famous historical figure's professional triumphs and failures. Josephine had been a mistress to a number of other news-worthy men, and the legally binding document did not stop her from continuing on as an adulteress. Kirby, for her part, is wonderfully miserable as the confused temptress-empress, though the film never truly dives too deep into her background or gives her enough meaningful attention. As far as straight biopics go, ""Napoleon"" is a weird one. The film, like its subject, is temperamental and rash. Scott hones in on the small details in Napoleon's life that make the historical figure out to be less cunning and calculating than his notoriety and long-lasting legacy would imply. Then, in Phoenix's hands, Napoleon turns completely childish, rash and imbecilic. Phoenix's penchant for dry, understated performances turns this one into a downright comedy, a Wes Anderson character study trapped in a Steven Spielberg period drama. Is this meant to be funny? Is it funny at all? Where does Napoleon start when Phoenix never seems to end? This will work for some viewers as an unexpected dram-com; it does not work for me. Instead, I found the scope of the film's budget, the beauty of its set design, the intricacy of its costumes and the many details that make it an exceptional output by a first-class director to be utterly undermined by a nonsensical script that focused on comedy jabs and laconic vignettes to tear down a famous figure who, as it happens, doesn't need any help being the vertically challenged butt of every joke, even 200 years later. "
"Dec 8, 2023",positive," War is hell, of course, in Ridley Scott’s biopic of Napoleon Bonaparte. But for viewers of this film, safe in their cinema seats, it is also inescapably magnificent. Scott’s film is the latest of dozens focused on this towering personality: some great (Abel Gance’s innovative, passionate and patriotic silent film of 1927); some worthy (Sergei Bondarchuk’s colossal productions War and Peace and Waterloo), some … less so (King Vidor’s War and Peace, starring Herbert Lom). This venture – which really should be seen on the biggest screen you can get to – comes out close to the top of the list, thanks to its thunderous battlefield scenes, painterly depictions of key moments in Napoleon’s rise to power and an engrossingly complex central performance from Joaquin Phoenix. Scott and screenwriter David Scarpa chart Napoleon’s career from the chaotic years of the French Revolution (we open with the beheading of Marie Antoinette) and the jumpstart to prominence he gave himself masterminding a surprise attack on the British garrison and fleet at Toulon."
"Dec 7, 2023",positive," The latest effort from the endlessly prolific filmmaker Ridley Scott, the historic epic dramatizes the fascinating life of French figure Napoleon Bonaparte, tracing his rise and eventual fall — only to be followed by a second rise and fall — and examining his love and, perhaps, downright obsession with his wife Josephine. And while it gets an uneven performance by Joaquin Phoenix — who certainly looks the part at roughly Napoleon’s height at 5-foot-8 and regularly wearing the bicorne hat, ends pointed to the shoulders, that is synonymous with him — it is lifted by the level of excellence from co-star Vanessa Kirby, as Josephine, that we’ve come to expect. Even at about two and a half hours, “Napoleon” plays like the Cliff Notes version of the French military leader-turned-emperor’s tale, so we hope we do get the promised option of a four-hour cut when the movie lands on Apple TV+. (In theaters this week and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing, it primarily is an Apple Studios production.) It feels as though we’ve been escorted too quickly through his career, even though the movie spends no time on his childhood, introducing us to him only when he is on the precipice of the first of many military victories. As “Napoleon” progresses, he ascends (“Long live the republic!” men shout as he is promoted captain to brigadier general) and ascends (“Long live the emperor!” other men shout later, at his 1804 coronation) with relative ease. At least for a while, his greatest challenge is Josephine, with whom he is smitten upon their meeting at a ball when she asks him about his costume and he somewhat awkwardly replies that it is merely his military uniform. Soon after that, she sends him a note asking for the pleasure of his company and, after smelling it, he rubs it against his neck. At their lunch at an outdoor cafe, he pulls her chair closer to his, but it is a subsequent act of hers that suggests she is the one with the power in this dynamic. Even after their marriage, her rumored behavior will become a great distraction to him as he is trying to achieve glory for France in a faraway land. Aside from the battle sequences, the scenes in which Phoenix and Kirby share the screen are the film’s strongest, thanks largely to all that Kirby (“The Crown,” “Pieces of a Woman”) can convey with her eyes and even just a few lines of dialogue. Theirs is a complex relationship, to say the least, and the film lacks a certain pop when Napoleon isn’t sparring — or conducting another activity — with the woman he can’t help but adore. It doesn’t help that none of the film’s myriad other characters is remotely well-developed, including Napoleon’s brother, Lucien (Matthew Needham), and Paul Barras (Tahar Rahim), a key figure during the French Revolution. Napoleon’s meetings with rival heads of state, such as Édouard Philipponnat’s Alexander I, the tsar of Russia, are rather compelling, however, and Phoenix does some of his best work in those scenes. At other times, the actor — who portrayed the villainous Roman Emperor Commodus in Scott’s Academy Award-winning 2000 film, “Gladiator,” and whom the director says he wanted for the role after seeing his excellent work in the titular role of 2019’s “Joker” — is simply underwhelming. No doubt Phoenix is going for subtlety, but the performance frequently feels flat. Again, though, the battle sequences are there to pick up any slack. While they appear very modern in their execution, they thankfully fall short of feeling overly stylized, which could have nudged “Napoleon” into the realm of the action movie. The scene from one of the trailers where the French forces fire cannonballs at an enemy Napoleon has lured onto a snow-covered semi-frozen lake? Great stuff. As a character study, “Napoleon” is effective but only SO effective. At one point, he is described by someone who knows him as “a man bent on peace at any cost.” Text the viewer is left with just before the closing credits roll suggests “Napoleon” is quite concerned with that cost, but we never truly get that impression until then. What is the film ultimately saying about him? As penned by David Scarpa — writer of Scott’s 2017 film “All the Money in the World” and his upcoming “Gladiator 2” — at least with this theatrical cut, it’s a little murky."
"Dec 7, 2023",positive,"Despite all the history, the battles and the politics, this movie stays on track as a personal story. This makes Napoleon and Josephine characters in the story who are easy to relate to, as well as being a strong focal point for the film."
"Dec 7, 2023",positive," 
You wouldn't expect something so bratty and petulant to come out of the mouth of the legendary French commander and leader. But you would expect something so bratty and petulant to come out of the mouth of Joaquin Phoenix, the guy who's playing him in this film.
 
Having Phoenix, that prankish loose cannon (his Best Actor Oscar win for playing the Joker almost seems like it was prophesied), assume the role of Bonaparte feels like another one of Scott's crazy casting moves, adding some chaos to an otherwise stodgy true story. Lest we forget, he brought Lady Gaga, Adam Driver, Al Pacino and a ridiculous-looking, cuckoo-bananas Jared Leto (another scenery-chewing Oscar winner who once played Batman's archnemesis) together a couple years ago for House of Gucci and had them overact their heads off. While some might've thought that movie was a campy clusterfuck, I was quite amused by how Scott refused to rein in these A-listers, letting them add more absurdity to that insane story of '80s-era greed and murder.
 
When you think about it, it makes perfect sense for Scott to link up again with Phoenix (who also served as a producer) to play Bonaparte. More than two decades ago, Scott had Phoenix play the power-mad regal antagonist in Gladiator. The one-time ""rapper"" went all in on making his character a petty, pervy, swole-in-the-chest tyrant — you just couldn't wait for Russell Crowe to slide his foot way up that emperor's ass.
 
Phoenix is still a petty, pervy, swole-in-the-chest tyrant in Napoleon. But this time, he injects his performance with empathy. Bonaparte may be a stubborn son-of-a-bitch, engaging in bloody battle after bloody battle like a man staging an intense, neverending game of chess with his opponents. But he's always a dedicated, determined warrior, fighting even when things clearly aren't gonna go his way.
 
It is fascinating watching Phoenix play Bonaparte like he's a gamer who's constantly on the verge of rage quitting. While he's surrounded by actors (Rupert Everett, Swimming Pool's Ludivine Sagnier, A Prophet's Tahar Rahim) who at least are acting like they're living in the time the movie is set, there's practically nothing French or noble about Phoenix's Bonaparte. Even when he becomes emperor of France,
he mostly acts like he's in cosplay — a Comic-Con king.
 
As with most period piece biopics, this is really a love story. When dude isn't in battle, he has quite the toxic relationship with his wife, Josephine (Vanessa Kirby). Napoleon is crazy about this gal, even when she's creeping around with another guy while he's abroad. (Napoleon also had side chicks, so she feels her creeping is justified.) Phoenix is at his nuttiest whenever he's around Kirby and her icy-ass stare. Whether they're engaging in bitter button-pushing or messy baby-making (Phoenix really makes Bonaparte look like a rabid dog in heat during the love scenes), these are two broken people who are clearly made for each other, even when they have to divorce because she can't give
him a son.
 
But enough about Phoenix and his wacky ass. Napoleon has Scott once again making an action epic — one that, incidentally, his old friend Stanley Kubrick wanted to make but never got around to — that is equal parts majestic and bombastic. As the movie focuses on six major battles that Bonaparte fought, the battle sequences are vast, unpredictable and gory as hell. Even horses aren't safe from the limb-shattering madness.
 
It's almost like the 85-year-old Scott continues to make these vivid, violent, visually voluminous movies because no one else really does them anymore. (Scholars and historians be damned — he's on his David Lean shit!) While most blockbusters look like they've been cobbled together on somebody's iPad, the practical effects, sweeping locales (captured by veteran cinematographer Dariusz Wolski) and minimal CGI/VFX that Scott works with on Napoleon almost feels like a middle finger to this age of AI. Considering the movie will be shown on IMAX screens and in 70mm first (before it goes to streaming on Apple TV+, who bankrolled the picture), he really wants you to get up close and personal with the colossal carnage that goes down, whether it's on the battlefield or in the bedroom.

"Dec 7, 2023",negative," Napoleon is the latest film from Scott to be a miss for this film critic, joining both House of Gucci and The Last Duel. I missed my screening in mid-November because of last-minute scheduling conflicts in the nation’s capital. While I had an opportunity to attend a FYC screening during Thanksgiving weekend, my sinuses had other plans in mind. While I was told that there would not be any screeners, Apple TV+ recently sent a digital screener this week. As a result, I watched the film on Wednesday night. Going off of how many times I paused the film to see the remaining time, I would have been very bored while watching the film in theaters. The film follows the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte (Joaquin Phoenix) and sees this journey through his relationship with wife Josephine (Vanessa Kirby). Napoleon’s military and political leadership is also on full display during battlefield sequences that are drawing both acclaim and controversy for their depictions. Ridley Scott and Joaquin Phoenix can defend this film all they want. It does not change the fact that they get so much history wrong. As such, it is not surprising that French historians are slamming the film. I mean, if a filmmaker were to make a film about one of the American Founding Fathers and it was filled with inaccuracies, people would be calling it out. Oh wait, this happened with a pair of miniseries, John Adams and Sons of Liberty. You can never go wrong with a documentary in that regard. If this is the film that is just over two and a half hours in length, it makes you wonder what Ridley Scott has in store for his four-hour cut. Will it be in a miniseries format or one lengthy film in which audiences can press pause as they wish? Personally speaking, I would rather skip over whatever the filmmaker is planning if this very inaccurate film is any indication.

"Dec 6, 2023",negative," Conforme avanzaba Napoleón (Napoleon, 2023), la más reciente entrega del irregular Ridley Scott (que igual entrega una obra maestra como Blade Runner que una cinta fallida, como El consejero), me preguntaba a qué horas aparecería el héroe epónimo, cuyos restos residen en Los inválidos, el majestuoso mausoleo parisino. Llegó la película a su fin y Napoleón Bonaparte nomás no apareció. En la ruta vi a un actor norteamericano (Joaquin Phoenix) disfrazado con ropajes militares del siglo XVIII y XIX, que hablaba en inglés y se llamaba como el sujeto de marras; vi una película made in Hollywood (y recalco, nunca dejé de tener claro que estaba viendo una puesta en escena) que presentaba una sucesión de vilezas protagonizadas por el susodicho. Antes del inicio de la proyección me enteré de que el corte del director dura más de cuatro horas (la película que me aprestaba a ver dura dos horas y media), y es el que se podrá ver en streaming. ¿La cosa se explica, entonces, como sucedió con Dune (2021), la fallida película de Denis Villeneuve (y la más floja de su filmografìa), que se llama así porque habrá dos partes (Dune+Dune=Dunes, ¿verdad?)? Entonces, lo que vimos en la sala de cine, ¿es sólo una parte y su título debió ser Napo? ¿Será que en León surgirá el personaje que pasó a la posteridad como un genio de la milicia? (Por lo pronto los genios de la milicia son los ingleses, que emulan a los romanos de El gladiador en sus formaciones cuadrangulares.) Al final me resulta inevitable parafrasear a “nuestro” Napoleón: “hombre si te dices hombre”, ¿si no sabes de la abyección no sabrás de la gloria? Y “cuando llegue al fin tu despedida”, ¿seguro es que feliz sonreirás? La sinopsis de Napoleón que presenta la Internet Movie Database reza así: “Una perspectiva íntima de los orígenes de Napoleón Bonaparte y su veloz e implacable ascenso al trono, a través del enfoque de su cautivadora e inestable relación con su esposa y único amor verdadero, Josefina.” Habrá que precisar que hay algunas falsedades en la habitualmente precisa base de datos. No hay una perspectiva íntima (estamos claramente ante una película objetiva), y de los orígenes de Bonaparte por la cinta no sabremos absolutamente nada; para la relación con Josefina que quí describe Scott no aplicaría el adjetivo “cautivadora”. Tampoco es totalmente exacta la frase que aparece en el afiche publicitario: “Salió de la nada. Lo consiguió todo.” Estaría de acuerdo con la primera parte (por la cinta no sabremos de dónde viene ni quién fue Napoleón antes de 1789), mas no del todo con la segunda: ¿a qué se refiere con un “todo” que la película no presenta ni valora? El guión lo firma un tal David Scarpa, coautor del texto que sirvió de base a otra película de Scott: Todo el dinero del mundo (All the Money in the World, 2017). Vale la pena detenerse en el guión porque ahí reside en buena medida la mediocridad de la película. Para empezar: es un texto que no presenta claridades con relación al protagonista. Más allá de ignorar de dónde viene, no nos enteramos de quién es. Se le echa en cara su hambre de poder (¿o hambre de sed?), pero él nunca se manifiesta en este sentido ni declara mayores ambiciones. Es cierto que a menudo es conveniente dejar zonas de oscuridad en los personajes, para que el espectador se involucre y llene desde su campo los huecos, pero Napoleón, mustio, es un misterio de principio a fin, y su personalidad queda en la oscuridad. Nada sabremos de las razones que hicieron de él una celebridad. El perfil de Napoleón que se esboza en la cinta corresponde a un sujeto más bien nulo: es un cornudo incapaz de trazar sus propias metas (cada paso que da es sugerido por alguien más), su desarrollo en batalla es negativo (sólo en una parece sagaz; en las otras luce tan lerdo como asustado); es torpe y cobarde, y si la relación con Josefina ocupa bastante tiempo, tampoco sobresale por su romanticismo o su sexualidad: vemos a un amante rústico, sin imaginación, carente de virtudes para la seducción. Queda claro que no se buscaba hacer una apología ni una película épica (dudo, además que se quisiera dar forma a un antihéroe); mucho menos una exploración veraz en el campo histórico. Se agradece el afán de desmitificar al militar (en tiempos, como los que vivimos, en los que la mitificación es tan frecuente y expedita como la cancelación) pero el resultado apunta a la ridiculización, a la caricatura, al vituperio, aun al insulto. Es un guión hecho “en contra” de Napoleón, lo cual no es del todo censurable, a menos que, como es el caso, esta aversión reste toda densidad y profundidad al personaje y al tema (cualquiera que éste sea; francamente no me enteré de cuál podría ser: la película no me dice nada). El resultado se inscribiría en el cine biográfico porque da cuenta de algunos eventos y episodios que vivió Napoleón, pero no pretende ni consigue hacer una biografía que se sujete rigurosamente a los eventos que efectivamente tuvieron lugar. De ello dan cuenta algunos historiadores, que anotan numerosas inexactitudes o libertades presentes en la cinta. ¿Qué pretende entonces?  Tengo la impresión que estamos ante una de las películas más flojas de Scott. Al parecer el protagonista no le inspira mayor cosa y su inspiración en la realización luce por su ausencia. Scott, que habitualmente es bastante eficaz en el manejo de la cámara y en el registro de la acción, no consigue mayor emoción ni siquiera en las batallas. Y si en su filmografía previa ofrece claridad en el curso de las hostilidades, ahora por momentos es incluso confuso. Cae en esas facilidades que se han puesto de moda, las que creen que el caos es sinónimo de vértigo. La mediocridad de la película no reside en la distancia con el personaje que supuestamente la inspira, sino en la nula progresión narrativa y en la escasa profundidad que alcanza, en la ausencia de una verdad (y todo autor que se respete plasma su verdad en las obras que concibe, como deja constancia la más reciente entrega de Martin Scorsese, Los asesinos de la luna; Scott no es un autor, no está de más añadir), que no necesariamente tendría que coincidir con la que la historia ha enaltecido. Y si es deseable que una película de época haga un comentario sobre el tiempo en el que se realiza, no encuentro en Napoleón un discurso oportuno o pertinente para los bélicos días que corren. Al final aparecen las cifras de los muertos que provocaron algunas batallas en las que se involucró el malogrado corso. Napoleón es, así, una especie de ángel de la muerte, algo así como un asesino serial. Así las cosas, la pregunta sobre Napoleón es, citando a Napoleón: “¿Y para qué?”"
"Dec 6, 2023",positive,"Napoleon paints a pleasingly knotty, often unflattering portrait of its protagonist (who is shown as shrewd in battle, vulnerable in love and socially ill at ease), and is full of quirky, often humorous details and dialogue to savour."
"Dec 5, 2023",negative,"Mr. Phoenix's Napoleon could never have commanded so much as a squadron of the Salvation Army, and though the movie is sprinkled with a few reasonably hearty battle scenes, overall it's something like Mr. Scott's Waterloo."
"Dec 4, 2023",negative," Napoleon might deliver some great lead performances, but the rest of it is kind of a mess. It struggles to tell history in an accurate and intriguing way. When it comes to historical biographic films, liberties are almost always taken. In the case of Napoleon, it somehow both flies through the events of his life while also dragging on and on. When viewers that don’t know all the details of his ruling and exiles, they should not have to take to the internet to fill in the gaps after the movie wraps. However, with Napoleon, this writer, is not a history buff but knew some things, had to do just that in order to fully understand the life this man lived.  This movie covers the majority of Napoleon’s later life, including his marriages, battles he fought in, and death. While there is enough action sprinkled throughout the film to try to keep things interesting, the visual effects (especially when it comes to injuries) don’t look all that great. In particular, the early scene with his horse is done very poorly, looking fake and awkward.  Joaquin Phoenix does what he can with the script, and every so often he delivers a great line, but the majority of the dialogue is weak and even laughable at times. The same goes for Vanessa Kirby. These two try as hard as they can, but the writing and editing fail them. They are never allowed to shine in their roles as Napoleon and his wife Josephine. There is ever any real chemistry between the two, which causes the story to lose any emotion that audiences are supposed to feel.  Several times we are shown Napoleon napping on the job, and we can’t help but wonder if that is because he was trying to slug through this film as well, and couldn’t keep his eyes open. Even those who are not well versed in history know that Napoleon was a tactical military genius, something this film rips away from him. At times, he is depicted as a fool, who just happened to get lucky during some battles. That isn’t at all the case of the true man, and it makes it painful to watch. It isn’t all bad as some of the battles are well shot. They are spaced apart enough to try to keep the pacing moving and interest peaked. The issue is that all of the stuff in between not only drags, but feels as if it is jumping past key parts of the story. Because of this, the story feels all over the place and becomes hard to follow. Overall, Napoleon is mediocre at best. It is slow and boring while simultaneously moving way too fast. The lead actors do what they can with what they are given, but the dialogue and editing distract from their performances. In the end, it is just fine, and nothing spectacular or interesting. Instead of rushing out to theaters to see Napoleon, find a documentary or History channel special. Chances are you will not only learn more, you will be more entertained. Napoleon is a spectacle-filled action epic that details the checkered rise and fall of the iconic French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, played by Oscar®-winner Joaquin Phoenix. Against a stunning backdrop of large-scale filmmaking orchestrated by legendary director Ridley Scott, the film captures Bonaparte’s relentless journey to power through the prism of his addictive, volatile relationship with his one true love, Josephine, showcasing his visionary military and political tactics against some of the most dynamic practical battle sequences ever filmed.

"Dec 4, 2023",positive," El influyente filósofo, historiador y arqueólogo Robin George Collingwood (1889-1943) escribió, en su seminal texto póstumo La idea de la historia (1946) que, “a menos que se trate del pensamiento, no existe la historia propiamente dicha. Así, por ejemplo, una biografía… está construida sobre principios que no solo son no históricos sino antihistóricos”. La provocadora propuesta de Collingwood es que ningún historiador debería dedicarse a escribir biografías porque, en sentido estricto, si es imposible conocer de verdad a alguien, sea un contemporáneo, un vecino o hasta un familiar, menos lo es entender a un desconocido que vivió hace mucho tiempo. ¿De verdad alguien puede saber lo que pensó Cleopatra al encontrarse con Julio César? Por supuesto, algunos defensores de Collingwood han tomado esa terminante afirmación de otra manera: no es que sea imposible escribir una biografía. Lo que es absurdo es pensar que existe la biografía completa, infalible. Todo está en constante reinterpretación y lo que antes era entendido como una verdad canónica –digamos, la supuesta locura de Calígula–, ahora se interpreta de manera muy diferente. Además, hay otro elemento que a Collingwood, como buen arqueólogo que era, le parecía mucho más trascendente: hay hechos comprobables que no están sujetos a ninguna interpretación, es decir, edificios construidos, imágenes y objetos fabricados, monedas acuñadas. Y habría que sumar a todo esto los acontecimientos y las fechas. Por ejemplo, Napoleón Buonaparte (luego Bonaparte) nación en Córcega en 1769 y murió en la isla Santa Elena en 1821, a los 51 años de edad. Entre su nacimiento y muerte estudió artillería en la Escuela Militar de París y fue testigo de la esperanza de la Revolución francesa, pero también del terror y el caos, que aprovechó para convertirse en uno de los comandantes militares más importantes de la República. Derrotó en Tolón a la armada angloespañola, que apoyaba a las fuerzas contrarrevolucionarias realistas, y dirigió campañas en Austria y Egipto, que lo llevarían al poder político en 1799 en el papel de Primer cónsul de la República, hasta convertirse en el autocoronado emperador de los franceses en 1804, al lado de su esposa, la indomable viuda Josefina de Beauharnais. A partir de su coronación, inmortalizada en el célebre cuadro de Jacques-Louis David, iniciarían las bautizadas guerras napoleónicas por casi toda Europa, que culminarían en el fiasco ruso, la abdicación de Napoleón en 1814 y su exilio hacia la isla de Santa Elena, de donde se escaparía para recuperar el poder y organizar una última campaña contra los ingleses, que lo derrotarían en Waterloo en 1815. Exiliado nuevamente, ahora a Elba, una isla más remota que Santa Elena, Napoleón moriría en 1821. A grandes rasgos, entre saltos temporales abruptos, esta es la historia que cuenta Ridley Scott en Napoleón (E.U. – Reino Unido, 2023), su vigésimo octavo largometraje, una polarizante biopic que no está muy interesada en la precisión histórica, ni tampoco en tratar de entender a una de las más grandes figuras militares europeas, acaso porque parte de la premisa, como el profesor Collingwood, de que esto es imposible. En todo caso, a cualquiera que haya visto la espectacular épica romana Gladiador (2000), dirigida por Scott a principios de siglo y que tendrá una tardía secuela a estrenarse el año próximo, no le resultará extraño que al cineasta inglés no le interese la fidelidad a la historia si ella interfiere en la concepción que tiene de una buena escena –por ejemplo, una batalla– o de la idea que quiere transmitir de su personaje central, en este caso de su megalomaníaco, inseguro, vanidoso y ridículo Napoleón, interpretado en tono casi autoparódico por Joaquin Phoenix. Un ejemplo nada más: hacia el final del filme, cuando el duque de Wellington (Rupert Everett) está esperando el inicio de la batalla de Waterloo, un soldado que está a su lado le dice que tiene en la mira de su fusil al mismísimo Napoleón, que se encuentra erguido, fuera de su casa de campaña, dormitando parado, cual caballo lechero. El soldado le pide permiso a Wellington de dispararle a Napoleón, para acabar la batalla antes de iniciarla. Pero el aristócrata británico responde indignado que ni se le ocurra: “Los generales tenemos cosas más importantes que pensar que matarnos unos a otros”. ¿De verdad dijo esto Wellington? No lo sé, pero dudo mucho que en 1815 un soldado pudiera darle un balazo en la cabeza a otro ser humano a decenas de metros de distancia, cual francotirador gringo en película de Clint Eastwood. Lo importante es el sentido de la escena para Scott: este momento es uno de muchos, a lo largo del filme, que están destinados no solo a condenar la locura del poder de Napoleón, sino también la crueldad de sus aristocráticos oponentes, que jugaron con millones de vidas, cual piezas desechables de su ajedrez geopolítico. De hecho, el Napoleón de Scott no está muy lejos del Rufus T. Firefly de Groucho Marx en la desternillante sátira Héroes de ocasión(McCarey, 1933). Así como el bigotón presidente de Freedonia mandaba a un soldado al campo de batalla diciéndole: “Recuerda que mientras estés arriesgando tu vida entre disparos y proyectiles, nosotros estaremos aquí pensando en lo idiota que eres”, el megalomaníaco militar francés retratado por Scott no tiene empacho en abandonar a sus tropas en Egipto para resolver sus asuntos de alcoba con la ingobernable Josephine (Vannesa Kirby), se enterca en seguir a San Petersburgo sabiendo que en el camino morirían miles de sus soldados, toma riesgos innecesarios frente a los ingleses en Waterloo, y cuando todo fracasa, siempre tiene la explicación, como le dice a unos absortos jovencitos que lo escuchan mientras está desayunando, que él tiene otros datos, que es infalible y que su desgracia es que no puede transmitir directamente su talento a sus generales. La diferencia entre el presidente Firefly de Groucho Marx y el Napoleón de Phoenix y Scott es que este último no es un cínico ni un pícaro: es obvio que cree en él mismo y en nadie más. Es un iluminado que tiene que estar por encima de todos –antes que nada, de su esposa, que lo humilla todo el tiempo con sus infidelidades–; es un chamaco mimado propenso a los berrinches más ridículos (“¡Se creen muy salsas nomás porque tienen barcos!”, le grita al embajador inglés; “¡Mi destino me ha traído frente a esta chuleta!”, estalla frente a su esposa que ha sido incapaz de darle un hijo, en una cena que termina a gritos y sombrerazos); es, pues, un líder mesiánico que incluso retirado vive en su propia realidad, como vemos en las últimas escenas, cuando se repite a sí mismo que él fue quien incendió Moscú y no los rusos, como le dicen las dos niñas que hablan con él. ¿Así fue el verdadero Napoleón Bonaparte? No creo o, por lo menos, no creo que haya sido solamente eso. Este es el Napoleón que quiso retratar el guionista David Scarpa, este es el Napoleón interpretado por un inspirado Joaquín Phoenix over the top y este es el Napoleón que le interesó a Ridley Scott, no tanto el gran genio militar –aunque sí vemos los resultados de sus estrategias en el ataque a Tolón y en la batalla de Austerlitz– ni, mucho menos, el avanzado reformador de su país y de toda Europa –de hecho, nunca vemos que Napoleón gobierne ni promulgue leyes, y vaya que hizo lo uno y lo otro. Así pues, si alguien va a ver Napoleón esperando un serio estudio de su carácter o una biografía académicamente acuciosa, es evidente que saldrá decepcionado: Scott ha dirigido el equivalente de su celebrada cinta épica Gladiador, solo que ahora en el siglo XIX, con Phoenix pasando de ser el megalomaníaco emperador Cómodo al megalomaníaco emperador Napoleón. Pero esta vez, ni modo, no hay héroe a la mano que se enfrente con el villano. El villano es, de hecho, el protagonista. (Culiacán, Sinaloa, 1966) es crítico de cine desde hace más de 30 años.

"Dec 4, 2023",negative," Napoléon Bonaparte es una de las figuras históricas más fascinantes y polifacéticas. Es muy difícil ofrecer una visión medianamente coherente y que haga honor a sus numerosos dones, talentos, aportes, visión, errores, horrores y crímenes, así como a su enorme influencia en varios campos, registrada durante su trayectoria y, desde entonces, a lo largo de la historia europea y mundial.  Se han hecho muchas películas y publicado miles de libros sobre el personaje, pero hasta la fecha ningún producto audiovisual parece haberle hecho un adecuado reconocimiento; salvo la clásica cinta de Abel Gance, durante la época del cine mudo. Por tanto, para ofrecer una versión de tan complejo personaje quizás sea más apropiada una miniserie y, de hecho, se hizo una dirigida por Yves Simoneau en 2002, que al menos tiene la virtud de ser mucho más informativa y muestra más episodios históricos relevantes; los que faltan en la recientemente estrenada (y esperada) “Napoleón” de Ridley Scott.  También es posible que, exteriormente, Bonaparte no tuviera el aspecto físico o –a primera vista– careciera de un aura acorde con su genio militar, talento político y visión histórica; lo que hace todavía más complicado tanto una interpretación mínimamente adecuada como un marco cinematográfico al menos satisfactorio. Dadas estas circunstancias, el director británico ha escogido centrar su película en dos grandes líneas de acción intercaladas: la relación sentimental de Napoleón (Joaquin Phoenix) con Josefina Beauharnais (Vanessa Kirby) y una selección de sus grandes batallas; unidas sumariamente por algunos episodios políticos –algunos muy bien realizados (como el golpe de Estado contra la asamblea Nacional que instauraría el Consulado con él a la cabeza)– o biográficos, todos anecdóticos y apenas hilados entre sí.  Si conoces poco o nada del personaje, esta película te parecerá muy interesante y entretenida, pues ofrece un resumen básico, claro y, a la vez, sencillo sobre la vida adulta de Napoleón y sus logros militares, presentados con una riqueza visual superlativa. En cambio, si lo conoces por lecturas u otras fuentes, posiblemente te parecerá una cinta más bien limitada, superficial y hasta decepcionante; pese a la innegable calidad y fastuosidad de la producción (fotografía, ambientación, vestuario, maquillaje), y especialmente por las espectaculares escenas bélicas. En consecuencia, estamos ante un Napoleón para dummies, que muestra algunas facetas y hechos importantes de su vida a un nivel básico pero envueltas en un virtuoso ropaje cinematográfico. Lo único que se desarrolla con cierta amplitud es la relación entre Napoleón y Josefina, pero aun así esta se limita a sus hábitos sexuales, la asunción de su relación marital como una relación de y con el poder, y, desde el inicio casi, con la necesidad de tener un heredero (o sea, que Josefina se embarace).  Esto es todo y lo demás es mostrado o mencionado expeditivamente. Salvo el primer amante de la emperatriz, que merece un brevísimo episodio, ninguno de los demás crushes (de ambos) aparecen; el propio divorcio también es otro episodio fugaz, mientras que el destino de su vástago oficial, las relaciones de Napo con su madre y hermanos, prácticamente se pierden en ocasionales menciones y efímeras presencias. Aunque, insisto, todo muy bien filmado. Lo mismo ocurre con la trayectoria política y militar del protagonista, recortadas a lo mínimo. Así, figuras de primer orden como el siniestro ministro de Policía Fouché o varios de sus grandes mariscales aparecen pintados en la pared, presentados muy de pasada o son ignorados. Talleyrand figura alrededor de tres veces casi como simple enlace diplomático con los países enemigos del gran corso. A los emperadores de Austria y Rusia se les ve en conversaciones también breves, sin antes ni después, extractadas de contextos político-militares con el protagonista, los que nunca son desarrollados. Ni hablar de los aportes napoleónicos al Derecho, la Administración Pública, la Educación y la Cultura; así como su liquidación de lo que quedaba del feudalismo en gran parte de Europa, difundiendo la idea de la igualdad ante la ley. De esto, en la película, nada. Debo aclarar que esta opción talla small (y encima stretch) de Scott es comprensible y legítima, no solo por la excesiva complejidad del personaje, sino también por un tema de duración: el filme dura más de dos horas y media; y, pese a su limitado contenido, no aburre por el virtuosismo técnico y la amplitud, detalle, variedad y espectacularidad de los episodios bélicos. Si bien uno siente que mucho contenido queda en el tintero, es posible que un filme de más de tres horas podría afectar la taquilla; aunque, según el realizador, el principal factor es el “dolor de trasero” en caso de películas demasiado largas. No obstante, el propio Scott ha revelado que lanzará también un director’s cut de hasta cuatro horas de duración para el estreno de la cinta en la plataforma de streaming Apple TV+, lo que está por confirmarse y quizás explique esta puesta en escena a la vez concisa en el fondo y exuberante en la forma. Veremos. Mientras tanto, y aceptando “las tres S” (small, stretch y Scott) de esta puesta en escena, la película presenta otro problema: el peso de la historia de amor (que incluso trasciende el divorcio) termina por neutralizar el perfil épico de la película y rebajar el del protagonista. Ello porque la acción dramática en el filme no presenta grandes obstáculos a Napoleón, ni en la guerra ni en el amor.  En cuanto a su relación con Josefina, también supera el obstáculo con un remplazo express con la hija del emperador austriaco, que le provee el ansiado heredero, después de lo cual no volvemos a saber nada más del asunto. De otro lado, no queda claro exactamente cuál es el atractivo de la dama antillana, al punto que mantiene el amor de Napoleón hasta el final e incluso despierta el interés del zar Alejandro. La película no lo muestra. Es cierto que la atracción física o emocional por otra persona es, en el fondo, inexplicable y misteriosa. Pero en una película esto debe evidenciarse a partir de mecanismos dramáticos y/o audiovisuales que evidencien e intensifiquen esa pasión. Falta algo que eleve los banales líos de faldas, frivolidades y dolorosa infertilidad a esas cumbres emocionales que, por ejemplo, Verdi alcanza –con parecidos ingredientes– a través de Violetta Valéry, la protagonista de “La Traviata”. Esto nos conduce a las actuaciones. El enfoque scottiano del protagonista es el de un soldado que, merced a su valor y talento como artillero, asciende rápidamente hasta general en plena revolución francesa. Se omitirán sus dotes de estadista, político y administrador, por la característica small que ya hemos mencionado. No hay duda de que Phoenix es un gran actor (como Kirby), pero su personaje prácticamente no evidencia una evolución; pasa de quedarse dormido en una conversación con Barrás a estar más avispado en sus encuentros con el embajador inglés, el zar o el emperador austriaco; pero nada más. Faltan las otras facetas que estimulen el desarrollo y maduración de su genio.  Como militar, Phoenix muestra casi permanentemente un mismo talante olímpico y calmo, como si no hubiera aprendido o sufrido nada durante casi dos décadas de guerras europeas y profundas transformaciones sociales, políticas y de las corrientes de pensamiento y los imaginarios globales; mientras que, en lo personal, tampoco logramos captar la intimidad de su dolor en los momentos en los que este ocurre. Pero, sobre todo, no alcanza tampoco la cumbre épica, la fuerza y el poder, que encontramos en su mayor (y fugaz) homenaje en vida: la Sinfonía Heroica de Beethoven; dedicada a Bonaparte pero que el compositor descartaría al enterarse de que se había coronado emperador.  Pese a participar y encabezar deslumbrantes y trágicos eventos bélicos, sucesivos y masivos, él termina como absorbido en medio del espectáculo de sangre, a veces solo como un espectador privilegiado; pese a que, en otros momentos, sí exhibe garra para vencer al temor y participar físicamente en el combate (su mejor momento, me parece, es al comienzo, en Toulon). No logra emerger como el mayor poder en la Europa de su tiempo ni como –según la frase atribuida a Hegel– la “encarnación del espíritu absoluto a caballo”.  Aquí lo podría comparar con el caso de “Blonde”, el biopic sobre Marilyn Monroe, una película controversial (por su enfoque expresionista, oscuro y nada glamoroso del mito hollywoodense), pero en el que hubo consenso sobre la extraordinaria caracterización de Ana de Armas. Ella se alza por encima de los debates sobre la cinta y consigue una merecida nominación como mejor actriz en los premios Oscar. Eso no ocurre con la caracterización de Joaquin Phoenix, cuyo famoso personaje se ve encorsetado principalmente a su faceta militar.  Imaginemos, por un momento –y especulo (por última vez)–, que en lugar de Kirby hubiéramos tenido a Isabelle Huppert en el papel y que este fuera similar al tipo de personajes que ella encarna: dura, transgresora, hedonista, perversa y sufriente. Ello hubiera exigido, más que rehacer, profundizar en aspectos solo insinuados o enunciados, pero no mostrados en el filme. Por ejemplo, cuando Josefina le dice a su furioso marido: “tú no eres nada sin mí”, eso no se manifiesta en ni es resultado de interacciones mutuas, ya sea en el sexo o en los espacios de poder o en cualquier otro ámbito narrativo. Tanto Phoenix como Kirby tienen las cualidades para haber dado otro giro –oscuro, ambiguo y misterioso– a esa relación. Pero de esto, en la película, nada, nada. No comento al resto del casting porque en verdad su participación es tan puntual que no ameritan alguna mención especial, salvo quizás Rupert Everett como el Duque de Wellington, Edouard Philipponnat como el zar Alejandro y Paul Rhys como Talleyrand, los tres esforzándose por transmitir la personalidad de sus personajes en sus acotadas aunque eficaces apariciones. Por tanto, recomiendo a quienes vayan a ver “Napoleón” que se concentren en el disfrute de la fotografía, la ambientación, el vestuario, el despliegue audiovisual de las batallas (estas sí variadas), así como en la narrativa y las actuaciones que –aunque limitadas en el sentido arriba indicado– proveen un entretenimiento esplendoroso. También merece mencionarse la banda sonora, que incorpora varias canciones populares de la época (a manera de comentarios de los acontecimientos políticos), mientras que la partitura de Martin Phipps ofrece buen soporte a las escenas bélicas. Para quienes quieran conocer más sobre el personaje, el escritor Arturo Pérez Reverté recomienda la biografía de Napoleón por Emil Ludwig, considerándola la mejor. Por mi parte, leí hace muchos años la de André Castelot y quedé fascinado con el personaje. Otro libro recomendable sobre la época es la biografía de Fouché, por Stefan Zweig; también autor de una biografía de María Antonieta (que aparece al inicio del filme), con cuya decapitación se inicia la obra. Ambos libros son realmente “enganchantes”.  Para los interesados en las inexactitudes históricas (y lamentables fallas de continuidad observadas en algunas líneas del libreto o guion literario), pueden leer este artículo, que ofrece un comentario más equilibrado sobre el tema. Y para quienes les molesta el enfoque anti napoleónico de la cinta, les recomiendo “Los duelistas” (1977), la película inicial de Ridley Scott, donde dos soldados –un inglés y un francés, verdaderos alter egos de Wellington y Bonaparte– se enfrentan en encuentros más o menos fortuitos durante las guerras napoleónicas, hasta un (visualmente) espectacular duelo final (en el que el propio director “empuñó” la cámara).  Ahí, la visión prejuiciosa de Scott sobre el emperador francés se muestra radicalmente y sin tapujos, pero a nadie molestó entonces, dada las grandes cualidades cinematográficas del filme, incluyendo una estructura narrativa más elaborada (e ingeniosa) y todo logrado con un presupuesto posiblemente muy inferior a la obra de madurez del realizador británico. "
"Dec 4, 2023",neutral,"Napoleon thrives when these masterfully crafted battles are coming to life in the most epic way possible. The movie feels messy on occasion, but there is plenty to admire."
"Dec 2, 2023",positive," Somewhere at the nexus of Gladiator and Barry Lyndon resides Ridley Scott’s Napoleon, in which Joaquin Phoenix is allowed (encouraged?) to be weird in between stunning action sequences set amidst rugged natural beauty. Portraying the notorious M. Bonaparte on his rise from relative obscurity to Emperor, the actor excels at each life juncture, conveying battlefield brilliance and bedroom horniness with equal aplomb.  The balance of visceral war imagery with dark, quirky humor from screenwriter David Scarpa (All the Money in the World) ably captures the multifaceted nature of an immensely talented but intensely flawed individual and leaves viewers in tantalizing wonder at the next amusing anecdotes and details that will arise between iconic battles. As his beloved Josephine, Vanessa Kirby provides a grounded yet still wild foil for Phoenix’s occasionally Inherent Vice-level quirks, yet it’s Scott who’s the true collaborator here. By surrounding his star with gorgeous scenery and intricate production design, and allowing him to indulge his particular dramatic whimsies, the director crafts an idiosyncratic biopic that stands tall among its stuffy peers."
"Dec 2, 2023",positive," The defiant, scowling figure slouching on the French throne on the flyers that advertise Ridley Scott’s latest epic, need not feel too defensive about the latest film made about him. As a biopic, it barely scratches the surface and leaves so many questions about Napoleon unanswered. The man who has inspired a couple of hundred films and hundreds of thousands of books is still an enigma. As a historical spectacle, however, Napoleon is one helluva of a brilliant ride, and Joaquin Phoenix an interesting casting choice as the famous emperor, mocked as a man without manners. Was he really so uncouth? Maybe not as stylish as the French would have liked, but he was the son of minor Italian nobility and attended military academy in Paris. If he always spoke with a Corsican accent, it didn’t seem to diminish his skill at rallying the French troops. It is incredible to think that the post-revolutionary First Consul who became Emperor faced no less than seven coalitions of European forces as they tried to topple the Corsican upstart from the French throne. Ultimately, he did meet his Waterloo and his life ended on a small island, just like it had begun. This movie has to be seen on the big screen. This is top-flight immersive cinema, made with a wonderful eye for what looks good and with great flair for creating experiential entertainment. Scott and his cinematographer, Dariusz Wolski, a frequent collaborator, have created a dazzling kinetic cinema experience. The veteran director has, of course, an enviable filmography of influential genre movies, including Alien, Blade Runner, Thelma & Louise, and Gladiator, so it’s a pity that the writing here lacks insight as an exploration of a key historical figure. The screenplay by David Scarpa (now working with Scott on Gladiator II) is written for the contemporary ear, and that’s okay, but it doesn’t delve much into the family background of this fascinating historical figure nor place his remarkable legacy within the context of modern European history. After the cries of battle dim, this is something worth googling. As portrayed here, Napoleon Bonapart is both soldier and passionate lover. A military man, a brilliant strategist and tactician who longed for and loved his lively wife, the fawn-eyed Josephine (Vanessa Kirby). The occasional voiceover, based on letters they wrote to each other while he was away on campaigns, reveal the depth of their feelings for each other. Yet a cursory glance at modern history reveals his awesome legacy. A legal code, underpinned by principles of fraternity, liberty and equality under the law, that was carried across Europe and remains there to this day. A key role in the end of the Holy Roman Empire, and in the rise of the middle classes and meritocracy. How did Napoleon achieve this? A critical dimension to his story but it is not so easy to translate to screen. The action opens on Napoleon, a gunnery officer in the army during the French Revolution, witnessing the death by guillotine of Queen Marie Antoinette. In fact, he was not present at that event in 1793, but poetic licence allows us to see that he doesn’t cheer like the rest of the bloodthirsty mob. It signals something else is going on for him. The bravura staging of Napoleon’s first significant military victory a few months later that year, with the recapture of the port city and naval stronghold of Toulon, augurs well. There are many beautifully staged battle sequences to come, as the film sticks with the military side of things. Phoenix’s strangulated voice and surly manner are a good match for his controversial character, and Kirby is a wonderful Josephine. From time-to-time a voiceover reveals the contents of their private letters, and the film concludes with some odd suggestions that the pair were a co-dependent power couple. Now that’s an angle surely worthy of another film. I’ve a sneaking suspicion that including the famous victory led by Wellington (Rupert Everett) gave the filmmaker a certain satisfaction. In a totally invented scene, Wellington and Napoleon, who never met, express a shared appreciation for things English. Gentle light, rolling hills, and substantial breakfasts. It’s a bit bizarre but also a welcome down-to-earth note on which to end the story of a man who lived enough lives for ten men."
"Dec 2, 2023",neutral," Scott has now made a version of “Napoleon,” and it’s apparent that if Kubrick had any special advice on the topic, he never gave it to Scott. Scott has been and still could be a great filmmaker (see “Alien,” “Blade Runner,” and “Thelma and Louise”), but his new two-and-a-half-hour epic, now playing in San Francisco, is as rudimentary and as passionless as CliffsNotes. It’s akin to a bored professor teaching from a droning study guide. To begin with, there are too many secondary or supporting characters that pop up and then disappear like a game of Whac-A-Mole. Most are briefly introduced, and then vanish for a while, only to re-emerge again maybe a half hour or 45 minutes later. Frankly, for anyone who is not a Napoleon scholar, it’s difficult to keep track of all the names and dates and places, especially as events leap forward years at a time. It’s a memory card game with little chance of winning. The movie begins in 1793 — thankfully avoiding Napoleon’s childhood — as Marie Antoinette (Catherine Walker) goes to the guillotine. As she walks to her death, an angry crowd throws food, which sticks in her voluminous, curly hair. Then, head, hair, and food must be maneuvered into the hollow of the guillotine for the fatal chop. This, weirdly, is the movie’s most inspired sequence, and the only time Scott seems to be thinking cinematically. The rest of the film ticks off check boxes. Napoleon (Joaquin Phoenix) rises through the ranks of the French military, goes to war, becomes emperor, gains allies, loses allies, regains allies, is eventually defeated at Waterloo and finally is exiled on the island of Saint Helena, where he died in 1821. Many viewers will pay to see the many battlefield sequences with their mud, blood, horses, flags, spy glasses, swords, rifles, lances, and cannons — the cannonballs here explode like miniature atomic bombs — but the scenes blur together. At the film’s center, we have Phoenix, who, most can agree, is a fine actor. Phoenix does fine things with Napoleon, showing his lust for power, his self-assurance, as well as his baser emotions. It’s a well-rounded performance, even incorporating some moments of humor — let’s hope the line “DESTINY led me to this lamb chop!!!” becomes a meme — but not necessarily among Phoenix’s deepest or most affecting work. Where “Napoleon” comes briefly alive is in the casting and performance of Vanessa Kirby — herself a recent Oscar nominee for “Pieces of a Woman” — as Napoleon’s wife Josephine. This character might have been little more than window dressing , but Kirby brings flash and fire to the role, easily the equal of Phoenix. Their scenes together are the only ones that have any spark, perhaps because the performers each feed off of the energy of their sparring partners. It’s a shame that “Napoleon” is such drudgery. In past decades, when studios learned that biographies are catnip for Oscars, it has become clear that the best ones — Bennett Miller’s “Capote” or Steven Spielberg’s “Lincoln,” for example — focus on a single, important event in the subject’s life. The ones that try to cram an entire life into the length of a movie tend to end up like “Napoleon,” with scene after scene describing to us what happened, without ever getting into the poetry of it, and without time for nuance. Ironically, if Scott’s film could have gone on longer, he might have ended up with something truly magnificent and spectacular — such as Abel Gance’s silent-era “Napoleon,” released in 1927, and restored to a five-and-a-half-hour running time in 2012. That movie was so inventive and intoxicating that it has endured for nearly a century.  Conversely, the most interesting thing about Scott’s “Napoleon” is the tidbit that, apparently, the emperor had a talent for falling asleep while standing or sitting up."
"Dec 2, 2023",positive,"Is it a Gladiator? Absolutely not. But, you know, it's hard to be another Gladiator."
"Dec 2, 2023",positive,That brings us to the battle sequences: they are out-of-control great.
"Dec 2, 2023",positive,"I found it impressive and kind of startling at times, but I was not emotionally moved."
"Dec 1, 2023",positive," French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte is one of the more fascinating historical figures around, so it comes as no surprise that he is once again depicted in film with “Napoleon” – the latest from director Ridley Scott. With Scott’s steady direction and some strong work from Joaquin Phoenix and Vanessa Kirby, it’s a film that works well enough, even if the film doesn’t really tell you anything about the emperor that you didn’t already know. What “Napoleon” lacks in newfound insight, it makes up for with some well crafted sequences and Phoenix and Kirby’s dynamic chemistry. “Napoleon” takes a rather simplistic approach, following the rise and fall of Bonaparte – his addiction to power and how that addiction ultimately led to his downfall. David Scarpa’s screenplay also takes time to step away from the battlefield to document the volatile relationship between Napoleon and the love of his life Josephine (Kirby). Their relationship would make social media blush, a complex web of oneupmanship where it is hard to tell who is really in charge between those two. Scott uses the relationship to create some surprisingly humorous moments, with Phoenix portraying Napoleon with this horn-dog aloofness that only accentuates that dark humor. Phoenix plays the emperor in a manner where you can always see the wheels turning, constantly planning his next conquest on and off the battlefield. Kirby continues her string of strong work, making Josephine both a scheming temptress and as someone who truly loved Napoleon in her own strange way. The relationship is the heart and soul of “Napoleon,” but the film provides a little more. Scott has always been a director capable of staging grand action sequences. That strength is on display with several set pieces on the battlefield that is best seen on the biggest screens possible. The action is so good that the film probably could have used a little better balance of the story – and perhaps shaved a little time off the nearly three hour length. Ultimately the flaws of “Napoleon” are fitting of its subject matter – an experience that is satisfying even if it happens to be a little messy and uneven."
"Dec 1, 2023",negative," Robert Horton is a Scarecrow board member and a longtime film critic. This series of ""critic's notes"" is chance to highlight worthy films playing locally and connect them to the riches of Scarecrow's collection. Napoleon begins in 1793, its title character a young Corsican captain, and ends with his death in 1821. In other words, 86-year-old Ridley Scott has been a field general much longer than Bonaparte ever was. There must be some strong identification between movie directors and Napoleon (the big Nappy project Stanley Kubrick worked on makes you wonder whether Kubrick might've abandoned it for being a little too on the nose), but if Scott feels a kinship for his central character in this film he hides it rather well. Joaquin Phoenix's Napoleon is easily the most opaque figure onscreen; he's anxious (his eyes darting nervously before leading a bold move at the siege of Toulon), he's impetuous (grabbing the crown at his imperial coronation), he's laughably banal (greeting the freshly-defeated Austrian king by blurting out, ""It's so nice to finally meet you,"" like a matron at a church social). 	Most of all, he is a maladroit lover, whether wooing Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) by staring intently at her across a crowded room or boffing away in primal fashion in the bedchamber. Between these moments, Phoenix waddles around, mumbling his way through the part much more than mumble-gold-standard Brando did in Desiree. It's absolutely fine to have a modern Napoleon, and the screenplay (credited to David Scarpa) seems set up to give us an anti-hero … and yet this exhausted-looking fellow in the funny hat wanders through history, more hapless than world-beating monster.  	The battle scenes feature some startling images, as one expects from this director; Scott knows how to commandeer his forces so that we get a breathtaking idea of how the armies at Austerlitz come together and why Napoleon's strategy was so brilliant. A few political-intrigue scenes serve to connect the high points. But this movie is at its most charged when Napoleon and Josephine are involved in some kind of congress, and this is where you see what the movie might have been. As a critic, I'm not big on instructive movie reviews, where the critic knows how all this could have been better, if only the filmmakers had done this and that. But indulge me for a moment, because the movie's interest in the Private Life of Bonaparte cries out for an approach that proposes that the great man, a brilliant military tactician and inspirational battle leader, was clumsy with his wife, though he loved her fanatically. If we saw Napoleon's vigor, surely it would sharpen the difference between the film's two realms, and the romance would become more poignant as a curious sort of push-pull dance, in which Europe's conqueror could only ever be partly successful. 	That approach would at least offer a contrast, a useful central irony, for a dynamic film. There's a splendid moment when the future lovers, out on a proper date, are sitting at a table and Napoleon all but shoves Josephine's chair closer to his own—the military strategist arranging the field of play. But Phoenix's Napoleon, though he may occasionally raise his sword and charge into the breach, is a shuffler, as bumbling on the battlefield as he is in the boudoir. Now, this is an approach, and there are Monty Pythonesque satirical touches (the final shot included) that hint at a wilder and more critical slant on the subject. An afterword, in which the deaths attributable to Napoleon are listed, has more bite than what has come before. So what is this movie meant to be? It moves at gratifying speed, but looks rushed and downright dingy at times—an especially disappointing point, because if Ridley Scott is hardly given to introspection, he is nimble at making surfaces shine. 	If Scott were given to introspection, you might wonder whether Napoleon is meant to comment on the facile nature of the director's past work, its easy manipulations and violence. I doubt it, but the film does look tired. When it erupts with dazzlingly weird moments—such as Josephine breaking into laughter when she reads her divorce statement to the world, an act dictated by her inability to bring her husband an heir—this movie comes alive. Unlike his protagonist, Scott seems more excited by foregrounding the mystery of love than crushing enemy armies."
"Dec 1, 2023",positive," Lisa Johnson Mandell’s Napoleon review says that director Ridley Scott has reached his apex with this intriguing examination of one of the most enigmatic and outrageous leaders of the 1700s. Joaquin Phoenix is peculiarly perfect in the lead. I’ll admit I was a bit dubious about the casting of Joaquin Phoenix as the iconic French military icon, mostly because he was reported be going with his natural American accent—he couldn’t be bothered to get an accent coach? But with most of the cast playing Germans, French and Russians using standard Mid-Atlantic accents, authenticity was clearly not the goal. Surprisingly, the film doesn’t suffer from that. Napoleon stands alone in history, and Phoenix’s interpretation of him stands alone in film. What Napoleon achieved in France, rising from relative Corsican obscurity to become an all-powerful commander and Emperor of France, then facing exile on a barren island only to escape and return to power again, is a quite the mercurial feat. Punctuate that with his outrageously volatile relationship with Joséphine (played masterfully by Vanessa Kirby), and you have an epic tale to tell. If the editing leaves audiences a bit confounded, it’s understandable—there’s just so much juicy material to pack into one film. I would suggest viewers read up on Napoleon, even if it only involves skimming the Wikipedia notes, before settling in for this riveting cinematic event—it will decrease your confusion and increase your awareness of the utter havoc one audacious man can wreak on the world. Scott has always been both revered and skewered for his graphic and unforgettable battle scenes, and Napoleon could be the apex of them all. More than gore (although make no mistake, there’s plenty of that) they rivet attention with insights into military strategy and personal dynamics, giving them unique and fascinating dimension. But at the core of Napoleon is his manic fascination with his lover, wife and ex Josephine. Kirby is sublimely layered, while Phoenix is creepily unhinged. It’s a portrayal of a relationship unlike any you’ve ever seen. Lisa Johnson Mandell’s Napoleon review says that director Ridley Scott has reached his apex with this intriguing examination of one of the most enigmatic and outrageous leaders of the 1700s.

Like a Michelin-starred meal that someone forgot to season, Ridley Scott’s beefy account of Napoleon’s rise to power looks great, is served with some panache, but crucially lacks flavour. The legendary Brit – who kicked off his career with a more bite-sized but much saltier Napoleonic tale in The Duellists – is already promising a four-hour director’s cut. This might be one of those rare occasions where another 80 minutes makes all the difference. Napoleon has too much history and not enough story. In a performance that lacks dynamism, Joaquin Phoenix gets 32 years of Napoleon Bonaparte’s life to embody, from witnessing Marie Antoinette’s execution to dying in exile in the South Atlantic. But by prioritising a conveyor belt of battles, coups and revolutions over a more forensic investigation of its subject, the film too often leaves him feeling more like a passenger than instigator. Aristocratic beauty Josephine de Beauharnais is Napoleon’s – man and movie – main preoccupation. Played with a feline purr by Vanessa Kirby, her poise and elegance reduces the great man to gawkiness, then boyish jealousy, and finally frustration at her inability to provide him with a son. Napoleon has great fun with Boney’s frisky bedchamber antics – he signals his desire like a pig hunting for truffles – but doesn’t give Josephine much inner life as a reward for putting up with all the amateurish thrusting. There are lots of enjoyable historical details here – some of which may have happened; others (like the cannon-balling of the Pyramids) absolutely didn’t. At Waterloo, a British sniper draws a bead on Bonaparte only for Wellington (Rupert Everett, perfectly cast) to order him not to pull the trigger. ‘Generals are far too busy to waste time trying to kill each other,’ the Iron Duke splutters at this unsporting behaviour.  Like much in Napoleon, though, it’s not really a commentary on how the power games of great men are paid for in the blood of the lower ranks. It’s film without a clear point of view. A pre-end-credits honour roll counting the vast human cost of Napoleon’s military ambitions – four million men – suggests an altogether more sober movie than the action-packed epic you just watched. Of the cast of mainly English thesps, the highlight is Paul Rhys (aka Saltburn’s terrifying butler) as Talleyrand, France’s chief negotiator at Europe’s high table. He plays it with the half-smirk of a man whose primary job is to translate Napoleon’s rude utterings into palatable diplomatic language, but can’t quite manage it. He warns the Austrian king that he will ‘suffer the consequences of a man bent on peace at any cost’. Phoenix, by contrast, gets to bellow at France’s would-be adversaries: ‘You think you’re so great because you have boats!’ That line got a big laugh at my screening, though I couldn’t say whether the movie intended it. Scott’s All the Money in the World writer David Scarpa’s screenplay strains to show the clumsy side of this conqueror of nations, a man prone to sulky insecurity, especially over Josephine, and petulant outbursts, but overeggs it. Having everyone speak with English accents (including even French-Algerian actor Tahar Rahim as political ally Paul Barras) robs it of a major source of dramatic tension: the fact that Napoleon wasn’t French but a Corsican, an outsider in a land he feared would reject him at any moment. What drove him to keep fighting for pre-eminence in this unwelcoming land, beyond his famously self-professed ‘destiny’ and the quest for an heir, proves elusive.

"Dec 1, 2023",positive,"A huge display of pageantry on the battlefield and human squalor in the bedroom. Magnificent to look at, Vanessa Kirby shines as the manipulative Josephine, Joaquin Phoenix mumbles and murmurs as the lead."
"Dec 1, 2023",negative," Joaquin Phoenix stars as the eponymous ruler of France, tracing his career from an eager Corsican officer during the French Revolution to his death in exile in 1821. Scott's film traces his rise to power and his myriad military victories, along with his tumultuous relationship with his beloved wife, Josephine (Vanessa Kirby), whom he divorced in 1810 due to her inability to conceive, though he remained devoted to her for the rest of his life.  The film certainly hits the highlights of Napoleon's career, but at a certain point it just feels like it's lurching from battle to battle without providing much connective tissues to provide much human interest or historical context for what we're seeing. Phoenix's Napoleon is as petulant and needy off the battlefield as he is brilliant on it, which is a great gag and a nice change of pace for the ""biopic of the Great Man"" tropes that the film certainly could have fallen into. He's a man who just couldn't stop fighting whose hubris becomes his ultimate undoing. But we never quite escape the feeling that we're watching a live action rendering of the Wikipedia article on Napoleon rather than a fully fleshed out film.  Those who go in knowing very little about Napoleon Bonaparte are unlikely to emerge from Napoleon feeling as if they know more about him than when they went in. It has some tremendous set pieces (the icy Battle of Austerlitz is a truly breathtaking spectacle), and Phoenix is tremendous in the title role, but it nevertheless feels truncated, even at more than two and a half hours long. Scott reportedly has a 4 hour directors cut planned for release exclusively on AppleTV+, and while the film's runtime already feels bloated due it to its unwieldy pacing, perhaps a longer cut is what's needed to really let this story breathe. As it stands, it's a deeply flawed work filled with flashes of brilliance surrounded by poorly paced and half baked connective tissue that never really allows its stronger impulses to blossom. One hopes that a director's cut will bring a less hackneyed vision to the screen in 2024. "
"Dec 1, 2023",negative," The latest historical epic from director Ridley Scott proves  to be one of his worst films, with Napoleon featuring an uneasy blend of  exciting battle scenes alongside dry political drama and cold chemistry between  leads Joaquin Phoenix and Vanessa Kirby.  A biopic of legendary 18th century French  emperor and military commander Napoleon Bonaparte, the simply titled Napoleon lacks the passion and intrigue that a movie about such a notorious historical  figure should have.  Napoleon begins with the title character (played  by Joaquin Phoenix) witnessing the execution of Marie Antoinette (Catherine  Walker) during the French Revolution. The aspiring Napoleon makes a name for  himself by leading the Siege of Toulun against Royalist rebels and would continue  his military contests in fierce battles abroad. Political instability in France  results in the ever ambitious and popular Napoleon to become emperor. Napoleon’s  relationship with his wife Josephine (Vanessa Kirby), meanwhile, becomes  turbulent when she is unable to produce an heir to the throne.  Scripted by David Scarpa (The Last Duel), Napoleon plods along as a greatest hits package of the “Little Emperor’s” rise and  fall. Scott would have benefited in having the extra time to flesh out his characters  and their motives, especially regarding the subplots involving complex political  matters. The inconsistent use of accents throughout Napoleon furthermore  robs the film of a geographical and cultural identity. Even more curious are the dull performances from the  films’ cast, especially Joaquin Phoenix, who never seemed to inhabit the skin  of Napoleon Bonapart, with the Oscar winner’s performance closer in feel to a cosplay  version of the iconic historical figure. Amongst all the period setting and battle sequences –  which are spectacular in design and execution – it is the romance between  Napoleon and Josephine which Scott deemed to be the soul of Napoleon. Unfortunately,  Napoleon it is a film that lacks spirit. "
"Dec 1, 2023",neutral," Ridley Scott’s Napoleon Bonaparte is petulant, over-confident. He likes to make animal noises and is often ill at ease. He is deeply infatuated with his wife. He can fall asleep at crucial moments. His ambitions are boundless, his limitations often comical. He’s very into cannons. He combines the extraordinary and the extremely ordinary in disconcerting ways. Scott and screenwriter David Scarpa (All the Money in the World) have taken the long view, following their subject over the course of almost thirty years. The film begins with the execution of Marie Antoinette and ends with Napoleon in exile in St Helena, toppling sideways off a chair. Almost inevitably, what they have come up with feels abridged and truncated, with blink-and-you’ll-miss-it moments from the historical record, fleeting incidents of exposition, grand gestures and moments of splendour, battles shown in intense, expansive detail.

"Dec 1, 2023",negative," Almost 100 years ago, Abel Gance made a movie about Napoleon Bonaparte. That was more than 100 years after the French conqueror’s death, but Bonaparte still cast so big a shadow that Gance felt he had to break film aesthetics to do his subject justice. In his 1927 epic Napoleon, he pioneered so many cinematic techniques that it astonished the most innovative French New Wave filmmakers decades later. It’s a lot to ask an 85-year-old filmmaker to do something similar when he makes his own movie about the legendary conqueror. What I don’t think is too much is for that director to create something insightful that makes us see its subject in a new light or at least engages our attention. After all, 81-year-old Martin Scorsese succeeded on both counts with Killers of the Flower Moon. Despite some creative bursts, this is where Ridley Scott and his movie fail. Let’s start with what works here. Napoleon offers two excellent combat sequences, one during the Battle of Toulon and the other during the Battle of Austerlitz. The latter shows just what made Napoleon (Joaquin Phoenix) a military genius, as the general directs his forces to deceive his Austrian and Russian enemies into thinking they’ve ambushed the French camp and then chase them across a frozen lake. This culminates in a cool shot of French cannons punching holes in the ice and consigning thousands of soldiers and horses to death in the frigid waters. Napoleon’s first attempt to seize power is treated as bloody farce, with the politicians giving him and brother Lucien (Matthew Needham) a serious beating and chasing them out of the assembly building before the Bonapartes return with armed soldiers. Scott directed Phoenix to one of his greatest performances in Gladiator — to this day, I find uses in my daily life for the line “It vexes me. I’m terribly vexed.” Yet I’m roundly underwhelmed by Phoenix’s performance here, more than I ever have been by his acting. His Napoleon is a charmless lump who has CGI to make him look shorter. The film is supposed to rest on the relationship between him and Joséphine de Beauharnais (Vanessa Kirby), the aristocrat he marries for political purposes. David Scarpa’s script makes some vague indications that she has social skills that he lacks, but the movie doesn’t follow through on this plot. The marriage has about as much passion as the joyless sex that Napoleon and Joséphine have in a fruitless attempt to produce an heir. The film implies that Napoleon loses the Battle of Waterloo because he’s mourning her death from pneumonia, and it gives no emotional weight to the story. I prefer the explanation that he lost Waterloo because his terrible hemorrhoids kept him from mounting his horse and surveying the battlefield. It’s surely not encouraging that Pablo Larraín’s El Conde — a Chilean black-and-white vampire movie that came out two months ago — stages the execution of Marie Antoinette more convincingly. The movie’s 157 minutes speed by all the highlights of Napoleon’s rise and fall without stopping to extract any deeper meaning from them. Scott loses the thread of the story detailing Napoleon’s dealings with Britain, Austria, Russia, and his friends, enemies, and frenemies within France. The story of this Corsican gunnery sergeant, a quintessential outsider who brought Europe’s kings to their knees, probably has something to tell us about today’s political landscape. Too bad Napoleon doesn’t find it."
"Dec 1, 2023",negative," Sixteen years later, Eli Roth has finally delivered the actual film ""Thanksgiving,"" and it’s a holiday horror treat. Christmas and Halloween have a slew of horror films set on their holidays, but Thanksgiving only has Roth's film and a $3,500 indie project shot in less than two weeks called ""ThanksKilling."" In that film, the killer is a homicidal, axe-welding turkey with it's memorable line, ""Gobble, gobble, motherf—ker!"" A line that was thought of before the script was even written. ""ThanksKilling"" was reportedly shot in 2006, a year before Roth's faux trailer debuted. I just needed to give ""ThanksKilling"" a little shoutout. ""Thanksgiving"" is the third fake ""Grindhouse"" trailer to get a movie spinoff. The others being Robert Rodriguez's ""Machete"" and Jason Eisener's ""Hobo With a Shotgun.""  All three have made the transition to the big screen with inspired success. In Roth's case, he carefully recreates all the key moments in the trailer from the mascot turkey getting decapitated in the Thanksgiving parade to the cheerleader on the trampoline (although, I did prefer the trailer version of her demise). But while the events of the trailer are faithfully adhered to, Roth trades in the gritty '80s grindhouse visual style for something much slicker and more modern, which does make me a little sad.  But the brilliant addition Roth brings to the feature film is the backstory to the killing spree. He opens in Plymouth, Massachusetts with a Thanksgiving meal interrupted by the need to kick-off a Black Friday sale early at the local department store. An increasingly unruly horde pushes at a barricade held back by just a pair of overwhelmed security guards. The scene quickly turns gruesome as greedy shoppers are incited to riot when they see the daughter of the store's owner and her high school friends getting early access.  The genius of the opening rampage is that there are no monsters or serial killers, just a mob of ordinary folks hopped-up on the rabid consumerism of Black Friday, and willing to trample and kill each other over the possibility of getting a waffle iron. For anyone who has watched real scenes of Black Friday mobs, you know the horror is real and well worth skewering with horrific humor. But a year later, there IS a serial killer in town, and he's out to get revenge on those he deems guilty of causing the Black Friday mayhem. He chooses to wear the mask of local historical icon John Carver, the first mayor of the Plymouth Colony. As Roth has noted in interviews, when history hands you a name like that you have to use it for your slasher film. I have to confess that I have not been a fan of anything Roth has done since his 2005 film ""Hostel,"" so I was gleefully surprised by ""Thanksgiving."" He is a different director, and it is a refreshing revelation. He finds a vigor and satiric bite that’s been missing from his work for a long time, and that's something to be grateful for.  He designs clever, holiday-inspired kills and serves up a horror comedy to delight genre fans. But be aware, there's a lot of gore and the deaths are mostly punchlines rather than anything meant to elicit real emotion. I find this to be perfect holiday cheer, but I know it's not for everyone. ""Grindhouse"" proves to be a gift that just keeps giving. Now if we can just a a movie from Edgar Wright’s fake trailer for ""Don’t!"" I will truly feel thankful. Ridley Scott has toyed with history before. In ""1492: Conquest of Paradise"" he tackled a sort of Christopher Columbus bio, and history plays a significant role in his films ""The Last Duel"" and ""Kingdom of Heaven."" But while Scott might have a visual flair for these period stories, he seems less able to connect us emotionally to his characters or narratives. Based on Scott's recent public dismissal of French critics, the director seems to be channeling a bit of his main character's arrogance. In fact he's been channeling that vibe for awhile as his recent string of films (particularly ""The Last Duel"" and ""House of Gucci"") have deservedly drawn criticism. But Scott, still riding on some deserved laurels for his earlier work, has zero tolerance for complaints about his films.  His ""Napoleon"" actually starts off on a strong note. It opens with Napoleon (played with scowling gloom by Joaquin Phoenix) displaying his strategic acumen to turn a siege to the advantage of the French and displaying Scott's ability to stage action. The other highlight of the film is a strikingly shot battle on ice that captures the brutality of war but in a visually stylish manner. But as the film progresses through its nearly three-hour run time, it never finds a balance between the epic and the intimate, and I walked away feeling like I have not gained any insights into Napoleon or what made him tick. And the film tries to cram so much history and battle into the film that it all becomes a blur. Granted, this period of French history is packed with betrayals, coups, political upheaval and more, so it is a genuine challenge. As a teenager, I read a fascinating biography of Napoleon by Vincent Cronin that attempted to capture his complexity. It may have been a somewhat romanticized portrait, but it was compelling and provided fascinating insights and speculation into what might have driven Napoleon to his spectacular rise and then led to his equally spectacular fall. I had also heard rumors of a possible Napoleon film with Al Pacino, and that has always stuck in my memory as dream casting. So perhaps I came to Scott's film with expectations that he could never meet. But Scott and Phoenix gave us a Napoleon that was almost a caricature in depicting his petulance and making height jokes. And I am not sure what's up with Phoenix as well as Leonardo DiCaprio (see his performance in ""Killer of the Flower Moon"") with their severely downturned mouths and almost monolithically dour demeanors. In ""Napoleon,"" Scott even gives us scowling face-off between Phoenix's Napoleon and Rupert Everett's Duke of Wellington.  Scott's recent fondness for casting very American actors such as Phoenix, and in ""The Last Duel"" Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, and Adam Driver as very European characters seems problematic. Phoenix fares moderately better than the trio in ""The Last Duel"" but none of them seem well-suited to their roles. In Phoenix's case, I just could never believe him as a commander of vast armies and was never convinced of the love between him and the Empress Josephine. Ian Holm has played Napoleon in a trio of very different projects. He's a footnote in Terry Gilliam's time-hopping ""Time Bandits,"" he is defined by the women in his life in a British series ""Napoleon and Love,"" and he is both Napoleon and his double in the wonderful ""The Emperor's New Clothes."" I would take any one of those performances as more enlightening and enjoyable to watch than Phoenix's.  One of the greatest films never made was Stanley Kubrick's planned Napoleon biopic. Kubrick's intensely detailed research in preparation for the film is chronicled in the book ""Stanley Kubrick's 'Napoleon,'"" which I highly recommend checking out if you can find a copy. Steven Spielberg is trying to recreate something based on Kubrick's plans. I'm not sure he's the right person for the job, but I would be curious to see what comes of it. I also recommend Abel Gance's silent film ""Napoleon."" But I can't recommend Scott's ""Napoleon."" Despite occasional visual spectacle, it fails as history and as biography and even as just an entertaining piece of cinema."
"Dec 1, 2023",negative," Napoleon Bonaparte is a monumental historical figure. It only makes sense that a biopic of his life on screen – directed by none other than Ridley Scott – should be equally monumental. Well, in theory. The film starring Joaquin Phoenix, now out in UAE cinemas, ticks many of the conventional boxes expected of an epic historical Hollywood blockbuster. There's outstanding costumes, beautiful cinematography, bold imagery and a captivating score. Who was Napoleon? Well, it depends what version of history you’re following. From a power-hungry political animal to a patriotic genius, a pillaging tyrant or an average-looking man with a penetrating gaze who made up for his alleged short stature with a commanding presence, above all else, Napoleon was complex, if not perplexing. Phoenix plays Napoleon – the general, first consul and then emperor of France – as a grumpy, irritable man, prone to nonsensical and erratic outbursts. Even his subtle facets of vulnerability – the way he covers his ears when cannons burst, his panicked breathing during the first (of many) battles, feel like a forced and lazy attempt to humanise Napoleon. Scowling and yet expressionless, temperamental for show with a sense of humour that doesn't land, it feels as though Phoenix may have taken cues on how to play the character not from historical accounts, but from the behaviour of rapper Kanye West. Also, Phoenix’s Napoleon may be the only time we hear the figure speak with an American accent. Not only does this crucial detail pull viewers out of the story, it’s also comical in all the wrong ways. No one should depend on a Hollywood film for historical accuracy. They exist to entertain, or at least inspire curiosity into the past. And in this regard, one can forgive many things. Bad costumes, questionable special effects, dubious performances, inaccuracies in histories or bad accents, in small doses, don’t ruin a film for me. But one element that is hard to fathom is a writer, or director’s failure, to keep their audience engaged. In the end, it's all about storytelling. It’s unfair in many ways to portray the very full life of a towering figure like Napoleon in one film. It’s mainly unfair to the audience – two hours and 38 minutes is a long time to stare at Phoenix's begrudged face as he attempts to save his marriage (or at least make it work) while conquering Europe. This was also the film's main issue. Is this the story of Napoleon's military life? Or is the main plot his tumultuous and toxic relationship with his wife Josephine? The film does a poor job at cohesively fusing Napoleon’s personal and political lives, which all versions of history tell us, bled into each other. They are two simultaneous storylines that meet at random touchpoints only to veer off into another battle, all of which are indistinguishable from one another at some point. It is a frustrating experience, attempting to understand this portrait of Napoleon. The tagline of the poster for the film reads: “He came from nothing… he conquered everything"". But did he really come from nothing? Napoleon was born into an aristocratic family and descended from Italian nobility. One would assume the film would show us this version of ""nothing"", but it does not. There are flashes of his mother and brother, with no conclusions to their presence in his story. Scott depicts an ambitious character without a tangible source for his motivation and his rise to power without a clear direction in how he achieved this. While the film attempts to present an analysis of the male ego, this Napoleon is, at best, a caricature of a complex man with an American accent and a sour expression. Perhaps the worst thing about the film is how it leaves the audience with the same question it has from the start – who exactly was Napoleon Bonaparte?"
"Dec 1, 2023",neutral," Director Ridley Scott did not come to praise Napoleon Bonaparte with his new film “Napoleon” — he came to bury the French Emperor under a muddled script, dimly lit scenes, overwhelming battle sequences and one of the most off-target performances by Joaquin Phoenix in the Oscar-winner’s career. As Scott has done with so many movies, the film is filled with lush and large scenes, whether it be the coronation of Bonaparte or his battlefield defeat at Waterloo. These scenes show the grandeur and ugliness of Bonaparte’s life. If the film was only being judged on a cinematic scale, it would be a massive success. The problem is writer David Scarpa (“The Day the Earth Stood Still”) fails to find his writing North Star. The story clumsily goes from an unorthodox love story to a muddled political drama. Neither storyline is good enough to make up for the mistakes of the other one. “Napoleon” charts the rise of Bonaparte (Phoenix) from the beheading of Marie Antonette to his final exile. History shows that while Bonaparte made some major military mistakes, he was either lucky enough or wise enough to rise to the throne. Scott’s decision – and the way Phoenix plays Bonaparte – is to make him more like a bratty toddler than a man who rose to extreme power. He becomes stubborn when all others are questioning his decisions. When it comes to romance, it is awkward courting. Phoenix has always shown a great knack for there being a flicker of sanity or insanity behind his eyes. How that goes depends on the character. There is nothing behind his eyes as Bonaparte. What should have been a broody power is more like a tantrum prequel. Even when he is supposed to show lust for Josephine (Vanessa Kirby), it’s as if he was playing the act of passion as described by a 3-year-old child. Even when these two historical lovers engage in sex, Bonaparte looks like a cartoon character flailing away. The disappointment is doubled as Kirby is wasted. Most of her scenes have her staring off into the distance. With Bonaparte such a weak character, a strong performance by Kirby would have helped create a little emotional spark. Both Phoenix and Kirby also suffer from the projectile vomiting way Scarpa wrote the script. It is as if he consumed all the historical knowledge of Bonaparte and then threw together only the chunkiest of pieces. There are historical and personal moments that happen without any explanation because of the rush to get to the big events. The film has a running time of more than two-and-a-half hours. Even that is not enough to look at both the career and personal life of Bonaparte. Scott should have picked one specific area and focused all energy into using the allotted time to tell the best story. Instead, the time is filled with snippets. One example is the annulment of the marriage because Josephine cannot provide Bonaparte with an heir. During the reading of their divorce decrees, Kirby plays the scene with an occasional laugh and smirk. There was nothing to set up why this reaction happened. Scenes before the moment would suggest a more sad or angry approach. With the story having so little structure and the main performance coming up short, Scott had to bank on the major battle scenes to carry the day. Whether practical or computer generated, the fighting is impressive in scale. The problem is that Scott opted for very natural lighting throughout the movie. This makes for some dramatic scenes at a party or in the bedroom. It doesn’t help on the battlefield that features large groups of uniformed men charging into each other. It is very difficult to tell which side is getting the biggest end of the carnage. Scott has shown with “Blade Runner,” “Gladiator” and “Alien” that he is one of the most talented directors working today. His fingerprints are all over “Napoleon”, but in this instance, the film was an example of his cinematic reach exceeding his grasp. To have a successful garden, you need to know when it is the best time to plant. Here are the best plants to start in May."
"Dec 1, 2023",positive," The first question Francophiles will ask is why are a British director of Oscar-winning epics (Ridley Scott, Gladiator) and an American character actor (Joaquin Phoenix, Joker) collaborating on a bio/war film about a legendary, diminutive (5’6”), French leader? Possibly because the film’s name alone sells itself and history buffs will be curious. Scott’s rep for stylistic overblown extravaganzas is another calling card. (There will be blood—and war.) And the prospect of watching quirky Phoenix analyze the leader and put his spin on the character is another draw. Napoleon Bonaparte was born on the island of Corsica, on August 15th, 1769, a descendant of Italian nobility. An outsider to the French monarchy, he aggressively championed the French Revolution in 1789. Rising from the military ranks, he ruled France from 1799 to 1804 as First Consul, then as its first emperor from 1804 to 1814. Bonaparte was heralded as a battle-hungry, military strategist who fought wars all over Europe. He and his troops invaded and conquered Iberia (Spain), Italy and forced Austria, Prussia and Russia to coalesce and quake under French domination. Basically, he made most of continental Europe his captive.  Aside from the warrior life, the conqueror had a wife named Joséphine (Vanessa Kirby, Pieces of a Woman), who was married before they met. She was sexy and he was smitten from the start. During one of their first meetings, they sat across from each other in a parlor. She suggestively opened her legs and purred: “If you look down, you’ll see a surprise. Once you see it you will always want it.” He did. They tied the knot; she became an Empress, but could never bear children and give him an heir. It frayed their relationship. The script by David Scarpa, a screenwriter with a sparse resume, is a cliff notes approach to Napoleon’s achievements. It’s peppered with rivals, colleagues and friends that passed through the leader’s life. It’s like the writer aimed for a cross between a PBS historical drama, a sweeping Doctor Zhivago-type war movie and a backstairs at the palace soap opera. One where the empress beds a young man, which publicly humiliates her husband. The hodgepodge of subplots mixes, but not well. Scenes where Napoleon and Josephine make love don’t add an erotic touch. It’s like watching a mutt and the winner of the Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Dog Club Show mating. And the dialogue isn’t always a big help, either. Napoleon: “I found the crown of France in the gutter. I picked it up with my sword and placed it on my head.” Really?  Scott seems miffed at finding ways to make the characters three-dimensional. Partial blame goes to Scarpa’s thin writing, which doesn’t match the gravitas, intelligence and imagination of David Franzoni, John Logan and William Nicholson, the Oscar-nominated screenwriters of Scott’s Academy Award-winning Gladiator. That film made the Roman general Maximus larger than life, and no one’s fool. It turned an esoteric historical figure into an icon. This one turns an icon into an esoteric and eccentric wart. Scott is notorious for placing style over substance, story and characters. Again, his towering production elements shroud the basics. For all the money he was paid for this role (estimated $10M), why didn’t Phoenix attempt a French accent. Yes, the movie is in English, and this isn’t a French production, but fake it. Make the audience believe in the littlest way that this man is from Corsica and not the U.S.A. The same can be said for the other cast members who play French military and political leaders, who don’t feign anything Gallic.  Kirby is English, doesn’t hide her home accent, but she deserves a pass. She’s the one actor in the entire film who is consistently mesmerizing, regardless. She works the lighting with her poses. Her softness as she speaks is so beguiling. Her Joséphine is the temptress that turned a world leader into a clown, embarrassing him greatly but not enough for him to completely fall out of love.  Abubakar Salim as General Dumas, the French army’s first four-star general, Edouard Philipponnat as Tsar Alexander the emperor of Russia during the Napoleonic Wars and Youssef Kerkour as French military commander General Davout also excel. Ian McNiece as King Louis XVIII, whom Napoleon displaced for 100 days in 1815, and Rupert Everett as British Field Marshall Arthur Wellesley the Duke of Wellington, Napoleon’s rival who ended 23 years of French domination in Europe at the notorious Battle of Waterloo, are excellent too.  Napoleon Bonaparte’s excursions last for 2h 38m (editors Sam Restivo and Claire Simpson), which by Killers of the Flower Moon standards (3h 26m) makes it short and sweet. If film fans trek to their local cinema, the meticulously staged war sequences, played like chess games, will keep them intrigued. Especially in IMAX theaters where the horrors will be a gruesome spectacle and views of the Sphinx will amaze. The film may play well one day on streaming services too, but some of the movie’s majesty will be lost.  Napoleon was a man who nearly conquered the world. A husband who lost his dignity. An emperor/warrior who died in exile. Surely there was a better way to tell his story. A better way to make a petite man a giant. "
"Dec 1, 2023",positive," Ridley Scott, the filmmaker behind Napoleon, is a European. Of course, the veteran producer-director, a native of South Shields, in the Tyne and Wear district of northeast England, is as English as it is possible to be. But for all that, the indefatigable 85-year-old Scott has something in common with all the Celts, Saxons, Angles, Jutes, Picts, Vikings, Normans and innumerable other ethnic groups who made England, and the present-day United Kingdom, their home—they’re all at least nominally European. Numerous wars have been fought over the issue.  That’s where Napoleon comes in. Scott’s 56th directorial effort tells the story of another European, a 19th-century Corsican French warrior-monarch whose name still resonates in world history two centuries later, for better or worse. Scott’s Napoleon is a rousing, red-blooded experience, an old-fashioned—and emotionally relatively uncomplicated—historical epic outfitted with modern production techniques and filled to overflowing with battles, intrigues and the scandalous relationship between former artillery officer Napoleon Bonaparte (Joaquin Phoenix) and his restless wife, Joséphine (Vanessa Kirby).  In Scott’s film, with a screenplay by frequent collaborator David Scarpa (All the Money in the World, The Man in the High Castle), Napoleon works his way up from an army captain in league with the French Revolution, luridly depicted in the film’s opening scene, to the rank of brigadier general—and eventually, Emperor of France—thanks to his seemingly unquenchable thirst for bloody warfare. Toulon, the corridors of Paris during the Reign of Terror, Egypt, Italy, the Austrian Empire, Russia—Napoleon and his troops subjugate the population everywhere they march, up until that nasty business in Waterloo. CGI soldiers’ heads and horses’ necks explode under mortar fire, and regimes go up in flames. Meanwhile, the conqueror falls in love with Joséphine de Beauharnais (Kirby), the young widow of a guillotined aristocrat. She’s a post-revolutionary party girl not entirely smitten by the coarse Corsican and his battering-ram style of sexual intercourse, but willing to overlook some matters while living in some of the continent’s most lavish houses. Director Scott digs down deep into his bag of extravagant European settings here. Even in the wake of House of Gucci, All the Money in the World, Hannibal and The Duellists, he apparently hasn’t yet exhausted the supply. Despite centuries of destruction, Europe is still remarkably well equipped with fancy real estate.  Phoenix may not be every moviegoer’s first choice for the title role, especially for those who winced at his performance as the cruel Roman emperor, Commodus, in Gladiator. And yet the actor who starred in Joker and Two Lovers arguably deserves the role of a violent megalomaniac, so all is forgiven. Never mind that a few of his line readings are stiff, and that Napoleon’s childish friskiness in one or two scenes seems odd. Let’s just say that Phoenix cuts a fine figure in the saddle, waving a saber, and let it go at that. Kirby’s impersonation of Joséphine is another matter entirely. From the very first glimpse of her as the merry widow at a cocktail party, she’s a beguiling combination of the bewildered coquette and the poule de luxe every time Darusz Wolski’s camera swings her way. Joséphine looks as authentic in her empire-waist gowns as Phoenix does in his cockade-bedecked uniforms. Kudos likewise to Paul Rhys, as diplomat Charles Maurice de Talleyrand, and Edouard Philipponat, as Alexander, Tsar of Russia, a pair of dealmakers in the Age of Enlightenment. Volumes have been written about Scott and the lasting effect his visual sense has had on contemporary big-screen entertainment. Napoleon belongs in the front rank of his creations, alongside such landmarks as Blade Runner, Alien and Black Hawk Down. For its thrilling battle scenes, its ironic characterizations of the revolutionaries who became their own special brand of aristocracy and for the essential European-ness of the project itself, this glittering, sweaty panorama of antique world history should be essential viewing. "
"Nov 30, 2023",neutral,"Almost everywhere you look, a risk is being taken that stands next to no chance of paying off."
"Nov 30, 2023",positive," «Waterloo, I was defeated, you won the war» («Waterloo, fui derrotado, tú ganaste la guerra») decía un verso de la canción con la que la célebre agrupación sueca ABBA ganaba el Festival de Eurovisión de 1974. En esa breve línea, haciendo referencia a la batalla que sentenció la suerte de Napoleón Bonaparte, se condensa tan solo una pequeña muestra de cómo el nombre del personaje histórico ha podido transitar de los libros de historia hacia la cultura popular para convertirse en un símbolo de tragedia no solamente militar, sino también sentimental.  Es también ese el retrato que Ridley Scott, veterano de ‘guerras cinematográficas’, pretende esbozar con su Napoleon. Pero no es el director británico el primer cineasta que intenta invadir la pantalla grande plasmando la vida de un personaje tan relevante para su tiempo como lo es para la actualidad, pues muchos ideales del emperador y militar francés indirectamente se han ido cumpliendo en la sociedad globalizada del siglo XXI. Sí podríamos decir que es el primero en conseguirlo a niveles tan prominentes en mucho tiempo, quizá desde las maratónicas cinco horas y media de la versión muda dirigida en 1927 por Abel Gance, un clásico de la historia del séptimo arte. Ya decía que no en intentarlo, cabría aclarar, dado que uno de los sueños frustrados de Stanley Kubrick fue realizar un largometraje sobre Napoleón, sobre el que se documentó exhaustivamente, pero que por diversos motivos, entre ellos la mediana aceptación de su posteriormente mejor valorada Barry Lyndon (1975), no pudo concluir. Para el Napoleon de Ridley Scott debemos considerar varios puntos a matizar. El primero es que, por las dimensiones colosales de lo que el también director de Thelma y Louise suele proponer, su historia es compatible con el costoso despliegue que solo Apple Studios estuvo dispuesto a cubrir. Es que podrán darse cuenta durante el visionado que US$200 millones de dólares pueden hacer maravillas si de aspectos técnicos y puesta en escena se trata. Eso sí, la versión que tenemos de estreno en cines es un corte comercial de solo dos horas y media en la que vamos revisitando varios pasajes de la vida de Napoleón (interpretado por el ganador del Oscar, Joaquin Phoenix) desde que presencia la ejecución en la guillotina de la reina María Antonieta en plena Revolución Francesa hasta su propio muerte en el exilio en la isla de Santa Elena, teniendo como principales focos argumentales las guerras napoleónicas y su turbulenta y pasional relación amorosa con Josefina de Beauharnais (una mejor Vanessa Kirby, en este caso). Otro punto que podría haber pasado como una mera anécdota pero que termina proyectándose sobre lo que sucede en el filme es que el propio Ridley ha comentado sin reparo alguno que no se zambulló en libros de historia ni en el archivo, sino que eso fue trabajo de David Scarpa, quien firma el guion de la cinta. Podría parecer tan solo un dato curioso, pero da luces de lo que Napoleon llega a ser como cinta épica y de lo que no llega a ser como drama de época. Un despliegue descomunal de vestuario, diseño de producción y de arte, un uso magistral de extras y una puesta en escena que durante las batallas termina hipnotizando porque nunca se percibe miedo al exceso (ni al gore), son los puntos más altos de una cinta que por momentos cae en escenas anticíclicas en las que se pretende abordar a un Napoleón integral, especialmente en su relación con Josefina y alguna que otra vez en cómo sus rivales lo percibían, pero que siempre terminan siendo dibujos incompletos. Alguna vez Marlon Brando interpretó en una de sus mejores actuaciones a Napoleón en Desirée (Henry Koster, 1954), una cinta que se enfocaba especialmente, aún con muchos datos ficcionales, en la vida amorosa del emperador francés y quizá allí el tono maridaba mejor con las intenciones. Quienes estén familiarizados con la filmografía de Ridley Scott, conocerán de lo prolífico y, al mismo tiempo, de lo impredecible que puede ser el director británico. El temperamental Ridley, quien no teme hablar sin una pizca de diplomacia incluso contra contemporáneos suyos como Scorsese, ha dirigido por lo menos diecisiete largometrajes desde el año 2000, y más de veinticinco desde que debutó con Los duelistas (ya volveremos sobre ella) en 1977. Su impredecibilidad, por otro lado, viene más por el lado de la cantidad de géneros que ha explorado y del nivel de inspiración tan variado que ha presentado. Incluso cuando ha estrenado más de una película en un mismo año, sus producciones han tenido resultados tan dispares que cuesta un poco creérselo. Bastaría, por ejemplo, retroceder solo un par de años, cuando en 2021 estrenó una magnífica cinta ambientada en el medioevo como El último duelo, para inmediatamente decepcionar de manera estrepitosa con La Casa Gucci. A Napoleon le sucede que encontramos lugares comunes con varios otros de sus títulos. En Los duelistas, por ejemplo, los caballeros que decidieron batirse en constantes duelos a muerte se contraponían entre otras cosas, por la ideología de su contexto histórico francés en plenas guerras napoleónicas. Mientras el Feraud de Harvey Keitel era justamente un napoleónico hasta las entrañas, el d’Hubert de Keith Carradine era más bien apolítico y poco interesado, algo que se extrapolaba a sus características y sobre las que podríamos identificar al propio Napoleón, por un lado metódico, analítico y estratega, mientras al mismo tiempo era egocéntrico y temperamental.  Con los años, por otro lado, el tres veces nominado al Oscar, ha entendido que su lugar dentro de la constelación hollywoodense es realizar producciones que tengan como principal atractivo el espectáculo que capture al público, por encima de plantear un cine de autor con un fondo más profundo que el mero entretenimiento. No hay crítica ni desdén en este comentario, sino todo lo contrario. Saberse director de varios clásicos le ha permitido especializarse en sus atributos, por ejemplo con el despliegue fantástico que también tiene las escenas bélicas en La caída del Halcón Negro (2001) tanto como lo tiene en Napoleon. Ridley Scott sabe como hacer que cada secuencia luzca mejor que lo que haría cualquier otro director de su talla. No desde una paleta de colores característica, ni desde la composición de planos simbólicos, sino desde lo que él entiende que funciona mejor en la pantalla, algo en lo que suele acertar. Para esto no tiene ningún problema en ponderar su producción por encima de la base sobre la que se desarrolla este. Si algunos críticos y usuarios en redes sociales mencionaron que Napoleon contiene notables fallos históricos, pues bastaría con revisar las omisiones y errores cronológicos de 1492: la conquista del paraíso (1992) o de la propia Cruzada (2005) -ahora iremos sobre ella-, para determinar que a Ridley Scott le importa casi nada el rigor histórico en este tipo de largometrajes. Aclaro, nuevamente, que esto no es un reclamo, solamente una descripción de un director entregado a hacer la mejor producción posible.  Lo que sí podría constituir una especie de reclamo sería que con Napoleon está dejando que uno de sus títulos tropiece con la misma piedra que la propia Cruzada. Bajo el nombre original de Kingdom of Heaven, la cinta ambientada en la defensa cristiana de Jerusalén del ejército musulmán fue recortada hasta las dos horas y media por la 20th Century Fox para hacerla más comercializable en cines. El resultado fue poco menos que desastroso en su tiempo, y solo pudo ser medianamente remendado por el corte de director que incluía cincuenta minutos adicionales. La cuestión aquí sería responder si a la más reciente cinta de Ridley Scott le afecta la reducción de ochenta minutos que sí serán incluidos en la versión que llegará próximamente al streaming. Creo no solamente que le afecta, sino que es su principal y casi único problema.  Se hace muy notorio en ciertas secuencias (me descuadró personalmente justo antes de llegar a la coronación de Napoleón en Notre Dame), pero especialmente impacta en la poca profundidad que se le puede dar al propio protagonista en el metraje. Todo está muy comprimido, irónicamente en el largometraje de un personaje al que se le atribuye, inciertamente, la icónica frase «Vísteme despacio, que tengo prisa». No se hace explícita la realidad de Francia mientras él ascendía meteóricamente en su carrera militar, ni tampoco entendemos detalladamente sus motivaciones. Sí hay alguna referencia a su relación con su madre, pero son los libros de historia que ya tenemos grabados y no el guion propio de la película quien hace casi todo el trabajo descriptivo de Napoleón. Por ello es por lo que Vanessa Kirby, que algo mejor desarrolla a su Josefina, gana un poco más de adeptos que el propio Joaquin Phoenix para competir por alguna estatuilla en la categoría de actuación en la venidera temporada de premios.  No es para nada la falta de una trama mejor desarrollada un problema menor, pero aun así, el trabajo para lograr escenas magníficas en el campo de batalla vale toda la pena y elevan la película a un lugar privilegiado en la filmografía del director y en mi ranking anual, pues podría decir con toda seguridad que son pocas las películas que nos quedan por ver en el futuro que logren tal nivel de excelencia en este campo. Así que, si es que hay un consejo por dar es que se dejen conquistar por la puesta en escena de Napoleon. Eso sí en pantalla grande, antes de ser exiliada al streaming."
"Nov 30, 2023",positive," La cartelera correspondiente a la semana del Día de Acción de Gracias siempre tiene puntos fuertes, como lo demuestra este año el lanzamiento de una cinta biográfica que ha venido dando de qué hablar desde que se presentó su primer tráiler. Alrededor de ella, encontramos también otros títulos de interés que comentamos igualmente en nuestra columna. Los historiadores más serios han dado ya su veredicto: la visión del legendario director británico Ridley Scott (“Alien”, “Thelma & Louise”) sobre las correrías de uno de los líderes más controvertidos de todos los tiempos incurre en numerosas inexactitudes, lo que, para varios de ellos, invalida su propuesta. Esto ha desatado un amplio debate sobre las licencias que puede tomar el cine y las libertades propias de la ficción. Pero lo nuestro va por otro lado. ¿Qué es lo que ofrece “Napoleon”, que se encuentra ya en cartelera, en términos puramente cinematográficos? ¿Mantiene todavía el veterano Scott la forma artística adecuada como para ofrecernos una cinta de la magnitud de sus incursiones más logradas en terrenos históricos, como fue el caso de “The Duellists” (1977), de “Gladiator” (2000) e incluso de la reciente -e infravalorada- “The Last Duel” (2021)? Hay que decir, para empezar, que las escenas de acción de esta cinta (porque tenemos representaciones de batallas tan esenciales como la de Austerlitz y la de Waterloo) son absolutamente espectaculares. Con la ayuda del director de fotografía polaco Dariusz Wolski (“The Crow”, “Prometheus”), Scott construye frescos inmensos desarrollados esencialmente con efectos prácticos y cientos de extras. El realismo de estas secuencias se ve resaltado por momentos de ‘gore’ que no llegan nunca a ser excesivos. Claro que “Napoleon” no sucede únicamente en los campos de combate. Mucho de lo que se ve corresponde a los tejes y manejes políticos sucedidos entre estos enfrentamientos, que no dejan de ser instructivos y reveladores, pero que terminan siendo insuficientes tanto para la comprensión real de la época como para la de la personalidad de Bonaparte, pese a que la película dura más de dos horas y media. Tampoco se hace esfuerzo alguno para analizar el talento como estratega bélico de su protagonista, lo que es una pena cuando se sabe que él mismo sigue siendo considerado como uno de los mejores de toda la Historia dentro de ese rubro. Lo que no falta, curiosamente, es la presencia de un sentido del humor que podría resultar desconcertante en vista de las temáticas tratadas, pero que el gran Joaquin Phoenix (quien colaboró ya con Scott en “Gladiator”) maneja con solvencia. Sin embargo, lo mejor de este “Napoleon” se encuentra en las escenas que reproducen la intensa relación entre Bonaparte y su primera esposa Joséphine (interpretada por la inglesa Vanessa Kirby). Para Scott y el guionista David Scarpa (“All the Money in the World”), este fue un romance tan auténtico como obsesivo; y la manera en que se encuentra plasmado le da ocasiones de lucimiento inmejorables a Phoenix y a Kirby, dos estupendos actores que, más allá del nombre que lleva la película, comparten los roles estelares y son el centro constante de atención. Por razones naturales, estos momentos -que son apasionantes, divertidos y hasta alocados- tienen que ser los más ficticios de toda la cinta; pero los historiadores no parecen haberse quejado mucho de ellos, lo que demuestra que, a fin de cuentas, nadie es inmune a la magia del cine. Luego de obtener el Premio del Jurado de Cannes y de haber sido designada por Finlandia como la apuesta de ese país para la categoría de Mejor Película Internacional del Oscar, llega al Laemmle Royal “Fallen Leaves”, el largometraje número 20 de Aki Kaurismäki, autor por excelencia de su país de origen y una de las figuras más renombradas de la cinematografía internacional. Alejado completamente de los parámetros del comercialismo, Kaurismäki es un cultor del minimalismo que tiene evidentes deudas con el arte del influyente director francés Robert Bresson, lo que quiere decir que promueve las interpretaciones rígidas de sus actores y no realiza prácticamente movimientos de cámara, concentrándose en planos estáticos y en las acciones de sus personajes. Eso no quiere decir que se trate de un realizador aburrido, ni mucho menos ajeno a los pesares de quienes integran la sociedad. Además de emplear un sentido del humor muy particular que se manifiesta en los momentos más insospechados, siente una profunda empatía por las clases trabajadoras, lo que se ha traducido en la serie de películas vinculadas al proletariado que ha venido haciendo durante los últimos años y que nos conducen hasta “Fallen Leaves”. Ansa (Alma Pöysti) y Holappa (Jussi Vatanen) son dos trabajadores de diferentes empresas situadas en Helsinki cuyas vidas se ven constantemente alteradas por las normas de un sistema de explotación que no les brinda estabilidad alguna, lo que se ve agravado en el caso del segundo por el alcoholismo, generado a la vez por las insatisfacciones laborales ya citadas. Ansa y Holappa, que trabajan por separado, se conocen por casualidad en un karaoke y empiezan luego a verse, aunque sus parcas personalidades (ideales para el estilo de Kaurismäki) los llevan a caer en una serie de errores y de equivocaciones que no facilitan precisamente el desarrollo del romance. Pese a la aparente frialdad que recubre la mayor parte de las escenas, de la mano del experimentado y determinado cineasta, Pöysti y Vatanen se las arreglan para darle vida a una historia de amor que llega a conmover, que tiene más de un momento divertido y que se encuentra presentada de manera completamente original, empezando por el hecho de que, pese a situarnos supuestamente en la actualidad (las noticias sobre la invasión rusa a Ucrania son constantes), recurre a vestimentas, locaciones y artilugios que remiten a los ‘60. No has visto nada igual en 2023. Lo que comienza como un drama familiar sobre una madre soltera obligada a lidiar con un pre adolescente conflictivo adquiere dimensiones mucho más amplias al extender de pronto los puntos de vista para meterse en la mente de otros personajes relacionados a la misma situación en “Monster”, una impresionante cinta japonesa que ganó con justicia el premio de guión en la más reciente edición del Festival de Cannes. El drama, que se estrena este fin de semana en Nueva York y que llega a Los Ángeles y Chicago el 1ro de diciembre antes de expandirse a otras ciudades estadounidenses, es no solo uno de los mejores filmes del año, sino también uno de los más complejos en términos de construcción de personajes y de profundidad psicológica. Sobre la base del brillante texto escrito por Sakamoto Yuji, el experimentado director Hirokazu Kore-eda transforma lo que parece ser inicialmente un caso de abuso institucional en una historia mucho más interesante y llena de matices, otorgándole primero la perspectiva narrativa a la madre, después al maestro de escuela implicado en el problema y finalmente al chico mismo. Tampoco faltan comentarios pertinentes sobre la identidad de género, el ‘bullying’ y el papel decisivo que cumplen los mayores en el desarrollo emocional de los menores. Kore-eda destacó de manera definitiva a nivel global con su decimotercer largometraje, “Shoplifters” (2018), que fue nominado al Oscar y a los Globos de Oro, y que tenía como protagonistas a los miembros de una familia dedicada al robo como método de supervivencia. Ahora, el realizador oriundo de Tokio adopta una senda mucho más dramática, pero ciertamente realista, mientras obtiene actuaciones sobresalientes tanto de los intérpretes adultos como de los niños que participan. Esto permite que las emociones exhibidas se sientan siempre auténticas. El cineasta adapta también las condiciones de su puesta en escena a las miradas de las que se encarga sucesivamente, y aunque la parte infantil puede llegar a tener un tono más edulcorado del que era necesario, el conjunto se sostiene y mantiene el interés pese a que la cinta se extiende por más de dos horas.

"Nov 29, 2023",positive," I DON’T THINK AUDIENCES WERE EXPECTING Napoleon to be quite as funny as it is. At least, I know I wasn’t, and the shocked ripples of laughter that picked up steam as the movie went along at my midday post-Thanksgiving screening suggest the rest of the audience wasn’t either. But Ridley Scott’s Napoleon is something like an epic tragicomedy, emphasis on the comedy. This is not the movie to watch if you’re looking for precise breakdowns of Napoleonic politics or strategy (though the political scenes are often quite amusing, and no one working today can shoot an epic battle sequence quite like Sir Ridley). Nor is it a typical Great Man Movie, or even an atypical Great Man Movie. It is, rather, more like a farce, a look at the absurd vanity of greatness. It was not clear from the start that this would be the film’s main operating mode; in the early going, at the siege of Toulon, you get the sense that this could have been a slightly different type of movie. Napoleon (Joaquin Phoenix) sends his troops forward to capture the fort held by Royalists and their British allies; as they scale the walls, he gets antsier and antsier, finally diving into battle himself. No, Phoenix doesn’t quite resemble Maximus in Gladiator—Russell Crowe’s Roman general had a steely reserve that Phoenix’s twitchy Napoleon does not, even in this early sequence—but you can understand why he was a leader of men and why his men would follow him. A general on the front lines is always appreciated by his men (at least in the movies). As the film progresses, however, the comedy piles up. There’s the moment where Napoleon retracts his offer of dessert to an underling who informs him that his wife, Josephine (Vanessa Kirby), is having an affair. Or the moment when he’s negotiating with the British and petulantly ululates in frustration, “You think you’re so great because you have boats!” Or the moment when France’s republican pols chase him from a meeting with their feet and fists and he scurries to his men screaming about how they mean to do him harm and thus he must claim the emperorship. These sequences are all sold by the pleading look in Phoenix’s eyes, as if he cannot believe some new injustice is being done to him, and by the wheedling tone of his voice. Coming off of Ari Aster’s Beau Is Afraid, Phoenix has more or less set the bar for awkward guys trying to come off as slightly more impressive and competent and confident than they really are. Again, I do not think this is the movie that Napoleon scholars of either the professional or amateur variety wanted. I’m not even sure it entirely works as an epic film in the mode of Scott’s Gladiator and Kingdom of Heaven; I am curious to see what the planned four-hour version for AppleTV+ that’s coming out after the two-and-a-half hour film’s theatrical release will look like. Perhaps it delivers a greater dramatic arc that some will find more satisfying than the comic stasis delivered by this picture as it currently exists. But the movie playing in theaters now zips along despite its running time, the smoke-filled battle scenes look like beautiful, muddy chaos, and the performances were uniformly winning and amusing. In short, Napoleon delivers nearly everything I—a movie lover with no real interest in the meaning of Napoleon, The Man—am looking for in a motion picture."
"Nov 29, 2023",positive," “I’m not built like other men,” says Napoleon Bonaparte early in Ridley Scott’s grandiose, blood-curdling epic. The Corsican who becomes Emperor of France in the late 1700s is indeed that rare thing: a leader fired by his ego and a desire to conquer. Scott’s film – in which Napoleon is played by Joaquin Phoenix in a true powder-keg of a performance – traces his rise through the military to emerge as one of the most powerful figures in European history. The director of Roman epic Gladiator and Crusades tale Kingdom of Heaven knows how to stage spectacle like few other directors. The battle scenes are jaw-dropping, from cannonballs tearing through flesh to soldiers slipping into freezing water during the infamous invasion of Russia. What surprises, however, is how well the emotional battleground plays out. Early on, Napoleon meets Josephine (Vanessa Kirby), the widowed mother-of-two who will become the love of his life. The detail in their courtship is splendid, as Napoleon rubs his sweat on the missive he writes her and even yanks her chair to be by his side. His lovemaking is similarly brutish, as he attempts without success to sire an heir, while jealousy courses through his veins when he discovers she takes a lover whilst he is on a campaign in Egypt. With Scarpa’s elegant script spanning two decades, it’s both easy to get swept along in the majesty of Scott’s images and lost in the politics of the era. Only when Rupert Everett’s snarling Duke of Wellington emerges, muttering that Napoleon is “vermin”, is there a well-rounded antagonist to match the might of the film’s titular warmonger. Yet Scott frequently finds a way to prick the pomposity of his protagonist; when Napoleon sits on a throne in a room overrun by pigeons, he is assaulted by a cavalcade of droppings. Quite whether the film truly gets under the skin of Napoleon, and looks at what makes him tick, is debatable. But Phoenix is resplendent as the “Caesar” of France, his refusal to undertake a French accent a wise choice. Alongside him, Kirby is a resolute Josephine. And largely European support – Tahar Rahim, Ludivine Sagnier and Julian Rhind-Tutt among them – impress among a cast of thousands."

"Nov 29, 2023",negative,"Soulless, messy, and flat (that's just Napoleon's sex moves). Ridley ripped the dynamite from the name and chucked it at the historic figure, but Napoleon is a bit to choppy to call a masterpiece as it's more like the director's Waterloo."

"Nov 28, 2023",positive," Ridley Scott’s Napoleon doesn’t jettison the cradle-to-grave biopic of so-called great men as much as discredit it with a discernible wink. Rather than serving as a comprehensive chronicle of the eighteenth-century French conqueror, Napoleon is a parade of significant vignettes. The film packages its anti-biopic approach with the elegance afforded by big-budget productions while presenting Napoleon’s arc with a slyness usually found among Hollywood outliers. Joaquin Phoenix indelibly plays Napoleon Bonaparte with an elusiveness that befits the film’s treatment. Phoenix’s enigmatic, playful and casually authoritarian Napoleon saunters rather than strides into the hallways and battlegrounds that will earn him a place in history books. He’s a man of his time but also already beyond time – as aspect that is vividly brought out in the scene when he arrives in Egypt and witnesses the fate of its pharaohs.  First encountered during the anarchy of the French Revolution in 1789, Napoleon makes a play for total power, swatting away royalists and opponents while proving his military genius through a series of wars. One conquest bedevils Napoleon. Out of the chaos of the French Revolution emerges Josephine. Played by Vanessa Kirby with becoming hauteur laced with animalistic survival instincts, Josephine provides Napoleon with an emotional anchor. She marries Napoleon but stays just out of his reach in the same way that the movie itself stops short of an unambiguous portrayal. Helpful title cards chart the years and locations of Napoleon’s rise. He marches on uninterrupted until a campaign in Russia, where his eventual Waterloo is foreshadowed.  If the Russia segment references Soviet director Sergei Eisenstein’s 1938 classic Alexander Nevsky, Scott’s film has resounding echoes of Stanley Kubrick’s equally elusive Barry Lyndon (1975) – among Kubrick’s unrealised projects was a Napoleon biopic. Scott’s own directorial debut The Duellists (1977), set during the Napoleonic Wars, haunts his latest account of the folly of narcissistic power-mongers. Renowned cinematographer Dariusz Wolski’s soft lighting and painterly compositions reflect a pre-photography era. Scott’s reputation for brutal and yet poetic battle sequences punctuate a narrative filled with conversations and arguments. In the quietest, and most compelling, moments, Napoleon and Josephine sit at either ends of a couch, he uninhibited in his ardour and she implacable in her reserve. The mildly satirical tone in David Scarpa’s screenplay is a nifty way to avoid an explicit critique of Napoleons reign, while also providing a fresh way to drag the moth-balled historical drama into the revisionist present. The movie isn’t quite history as farce, but it’s nearly there. There is startling guts-and-gore detailing in the violence wrought by Napoleon, but also a studious distance from the man whose overweening ambition reshaped France, and much of the world. “I see nothing but success in my future,” Napoleon declares in one of his many missives to Josephine. Surely he’s joking?  If Napoleon appears to be parodying himself at times, there’s never any danger of taking Tahar Rahim, as French courtier Paul Barrass, or Rupert Everett as British duke Arthur Wellesley, too seriously either. The light touch carries over for the most part. Hypnotic in its own way but also slippery at times, the 160-minute movie is kept on course by Scott’s masterly staging – magisterial without the bombast, delicate where it could have been heavy-handed – vividly filmed battle scenes, and the two perfectly judged central performances.  The general is most electric in his grown-up dynamic with his consort, which is tempered with an understanding of how transactional such relationships could be. If Phoenix is quietly mesmerising, Kirby is combustible. Napoleon is never more petulant when he demands absolute fidelity from Josephine, or credible in his yearning for her even after the relationship has ended. Inscrutable for the most part, Phoenix’s Napoleon gives himself away when he first sets eyes on Josephine. Of all his conquests, she proves to be the most challenging – and the most elusive."
"Nov 28, 2023",negative," I'm almost embarrassed to admit that while watching Ridley Scott's ambitious movie about an ambitious French soldier who would be emperor, I kept thinking about a similar motion picture that never saw the light of exposed film. Things looked good, until along came an impressively accurate 1970 Soviet Union/Italy coproduction “Waterloo,” starring Rod Steiger as Napoleon Bonaparte. It tanked at the box office, and United Artists pulled out, leaving Kubrick to recycle his research into his lushly realized 1975 period piece “Barry Lyndon.” Even so, by the time we get around to witnessing Napoleon's historic defeat at Waterloo, our capacity to appreciate gory, well-crafted encounters of soldiers, muskets, cannons and swords has reached a saturation point. Probably take a cue from his “Eyes Wide Shut” by concentrating on the complex, fascinating relationship between the two lead characters, Napoleon and Josephine, a spunky, attractive widow he marries two years after meeting her at a “Survivors Ball.” The always watchable Joaquin Phoenix presents Napoleon as a capricious, socially awkward man of keen, strategic intelligence and a delusional ego. Vanessa Kirby brings a sly sexuality and a spine of steel to the aristocratic Josephine, a perfect, tempered foil for Napoleon, who, under an adherence to national duty, eventually kicks her to a French curb for failing to supply a requisite heir. “Napoleon” cries out to be a marvelous story of conflicted conditional love, not a studied, battle-stuffed epic as Scott and screenwriter David Scarpa force it to be. The supporting characters barely get enough screentime to establish themselves anyway, outside of Rupert Everett's scowling Duke of Wellington. Granted, Scott's visceral rendering of the bloody Battle of Austerlitz — in which Russian and Austrian troops meet cold death beneath a frozen lake broken up by Bonaparte's cannon balls — highlights the movie."
"Nov 28, 2023",negative," Forty-six years and more than two dozen films ago, British filmmaking legend Ridley Scott made his feature debut with The Duellists, a thrifty but gorgeous account of a violent rivalry between two officers in Napoleon Bonaparte’s army. To their credit, his dueling American leads, the Brooklyn-reared Harvey Keitel and the Northern Californian Keith Carradine, made not the slightest attempt to look or sound like 19th-century Frenchmen. But they might as well be the Marquis de Lafayette compared to the sleepy mumblecore shuffle Joaquin Phoenix brings to the title role of Napoleon, Sir Ridley’s return to this setting and era.  This gory but thematically bloodless 160-minute biopic runs an hour longer than The Duellists, covers an even greater expanse of time—28 years, from the beheading of Marie Antoinette up through Napoleon’s death in exile in 1821—and cost more than 40 times what The Duellists did way back when, adjusted for inflation. Which just goes to show you that $200 million of Apple’s money (the same princely sum the tech giant spent on Martin Scorsese’s far more enthralling Killers of the Flower Moon) can buy you sweeping locations and hundreds of period-accurate costumes and practically shot battle scenes, but it can’t buy a point of view. Napoleon is a handsome but deathly dull coffee table book of a movie, glancing toward but never fully committing to the Kubrickian comedy it aims to be. (Stanley Kubrick spent years trying to get a big-budget Napoleon biopic made, though it never came to pass.) I’ll put that failing somewhat on Scott’s inability to land on a consistent tone but mostly on the shoulders of his star. With Daniel Day–Lewis having abdicated the role, Phoenix stands as the what’s-he-gonna-do-this-time film actor of his generation. What he’s opted to do this time is, to quote Chinatown, “as little as possible.” Perhaps he used up all his energy anchoring last spring’s Beau Is Afraid—a three-hour psychological horror comedy that swung for the fences. Maybe he was saving himself for Lady Gaga, his co-star in the forthcoming (and French!) musical sequel Joker: Folie à Deux.  Screenwriter David Scarpa has opted to use Napoleon’s 14-year marriage to Josephine (his first, her second) as the fulcrum of the narrative, and you can feel Vanessa Kirby, our Josephine, fairly begging her top-billed scene partner to give her something. If she’s wasted in the latter two Mission: Impossible flicks, as some have claimed, her misappropriation here is more surprising and lamentable. Phoenix got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor from his heel turn as the craven (and fictional) Roman emperor Commodus in Scott’s Best Picture-winning Gladiator back in 2000. That performance worked in part because his weaseliness contrasted against more stoic work from the likes of Russell Crowe, Oliver Reed, and Richard Harris. Phoenix didn’t have to carry the movie. Here he does, because Scarpa hasn’t given Josephine any sort of identity apart from her association with Napoleon, which seems to pivot between genuine affection and mere survival instinct from scene to scene. Sexual chemistry is no part of it: There’s a running gag about what a lousy lay the great man was, with Kirby wearing a bored expression through one rabbit-speed, doggy-style coupling after which Phoenix declares, “Let that good work make us a son.” The other laugh lines Scarpa has given Phoenix land, too. Clearly we’re meant to chuckle when he claims, “I am not subject to petty insecurity,” and to guffaw when he explodes at one of his British opponents, “You think you’re so great because you have boats!” The writer and the actor both want to puncture the Great Man myth, and it’s a laudable impulse. But their comic aspirations mix like oil and water with Scott’s maximalism. Something more modest in scale like The Duellists—or hell, a stage play about Napoleon and Josephine that kept all the battles offstage—would’ve suited their intentions better. Especially considering that cinematographer Dariusz Wolski, working with Scott for a ninth time, has opted to shoot Napoleon’s various campaigns in a washed-out, grayscale color palette that inspires droopy eyelids rather than awe or revulsion. (Title cards at the end of the film present the casualty estimates from Napoleon’s 61 recorded battles, a number north of 3 million.) Napoleon gets a jolt in its final hour from the appearance of Rupert Everett as the Duke of Wellington, one of the British military commanders who finally defeated Napoleon at Waterloo. But by the time he shows up, it’s too late for the movie’s Wiki-style survey of the latter 60 percent of Napoleon’s life to course-correct into something more compelling. The movie’s most memorable bit comes early: Napoleon woos Josephine by honoring her young son’s request that Napoleon return to him a sword that belonged to his father, who, like Josephine, was imprisoned during the Reign of Terror, but unlike Josephine was sent to the guillotine. Visiting an armory and learning that no one kept track of which sword was confiscated from whom, the future emperor just grabs one at random and passes it off as an heirloom. Perhaps the rumored four-hour cut of Napoleon that will appear on Apple+ in January will contain more such morsels of revelation. Meanwhile, Scott and Scarpa are collaborating on another movie scheduled for release this time next year, one you could be forgiven for thinking it might be the 85-year-old Scott’s Waterloo: It’s sequel to Gladiator. We don't have one. Readers like you keep our work free for everyone to read. If you think that it's important to have high quality local reporting we hope you'll support our work with a monthly contribution."
"Nov 28, 2023",negative," Napoleon Bonaparte famously once said, “Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake”,,,but someone should have interfered with Ridley Scott’s  casting Joaquin Phoenix as the French Emperor and Vanessa Kirby as Josephine. Because of his brilliant military strategy – from 1798 to 1815 – the “Corsican thug” scored victories at the Battle of the Pyramids, Battle of Marengo, Battle of Trafalgar, Battle of Austerlitz, Battle of Jena-Auerstadt, Battle of Rolica, Battle of Borodino, and Battle of Ligny, having seized power, crowning himself Emperor in the chaos that occurred after the French Revolution. Working from David Scarpa’s history-heavy script, director Ridley Scott (“Gladiator”) spends 2 hours, 38 minutes alternating between brutality on the battlefield and violence in the bedroom, succeeding more in the former than the latter – since he used 11 cameras, filming simultaneously for the frontline carnage. In the titular role, Joaquin Phoenix is almost as quirky and creepy as he was as Arthur Fleck in “Joker.” He whines, sneers and – almost comically – habitually covers his ears after ordering the canons to fire. What he lacks is charisma. Eventually, as history tells us, Napoleon was defeated at Waterloo by an Anglo-Allied Army under the Duke of Wellington (Rupert Everett) with Prussian reinforcements. He was exiled to the islands of Elba, then St. Helena. Too bad nothing is mentioned about the European effects of the secular Napoleonic Code which eliminated traditional noble and clerical privileges and ignited changes to civil administration and law. FYI: Two classic films – both called “Napoleon” – were made by Abel Gance (1927) and Sacha Guitry (1955).   Stanley Kubrick wanted to make a film about Napoleon with Jack Nicholson & Audrey Hepburn after “2001: A Space Odyssey,” but that never came to pass. And eventually Apple TV+ will stream Ridley Scott’s Director’s Cut which runs four-hours."
"Nov 28, 2023",neutral," For the last two centuries, the reputation of Napoleon Bonaparte has fluctuated. Is he a monster, a madman, a master tactician? The scourge of Europe or its liberator? A revolutionary hero or a power-crazed tyrant? For the last two centuries, the reputation of Napoleon Bonaparte has fluctuated. Is he a monster, a madman, a master tactician? The scourge of Europe or its liberator? A revolutionary hero or a power-crazed tyrant? For the last two centuries, the reputation of Napoleon Bonaparte has fluctuated. Is he a monster, a madman, a master tactician? The scourge of Europe or its liberator? A revolutionary hero or a power-crazed tyrant? Recently, the man showed up as a joke on the HBO show Succession, when it was revealed that the Napoleonica-obsessed Connor Roy had purchased the French leader’s dried-up penis at auction. There was Old Boney, reduced to being the ridiculous hobby of the series’ silliest character, his manhood compared to “a strip of beef jerky.” Leave it to veteran helmer Ridley Scott (Alien, Blade Runner, 
Thelma and Louise, Gladiator) to make Napoleon big again — really big — in a 159-minute saga packed with beauty, blood and spectacle. Tracking Napoleon’s swift rise and stretched-out fall, the script from David Scarpa (All the Money in the World and the TV series The Man in the High Castle) feels both packed and oddly empty, too long and not long enough. We see Napoleon (Joaquin Phoenix of The Master, The Joker, Beau Is Afraid) building on a military victory at the siege of Toulon to rise in the army, then going on to take swathes of Europe and the Middle East. We see him navigating late 18th- and early 19th-century French politics — a quagmire of revolts, uprisings, coups, corruption and rapidly shifting ideals and alliances — to become First Consul and then Emperor. Even as he’s conquering the world, however, he seems unable to hold the heart of his wife, the shrewd, gorgeously imperious Josephine (The Crown’s Vanessa Kirby). Their love affair is transformed by Scarpa into a kooky, vaguely kinky psychodrama — at times comically overheated and at points rather poignant. The two meet at the so-called Survivors’ Ball, held by aristocrats who had lived through Robespierre’s Reign of Terror, where Josephine’s prison haircut gives her the look of a punk princess. Kirby, as always, is electrifying to watch, and Phoenix is his unpredictable self, his take on Napoleon feeling modern and weird, given to abrupt tonal detours.  “You think you’re so great just because you have boats,” Napoleon bursts out at the British ambassador at one point, sounding like a petulant eight-year-old boy.  We never really understand what fuels Napoleon’s need for conquest, either politically or psychologically. He wants to prove he’s not “a Corsican ruffian unfit for higher office,” and a brief conversation with his brother suggests he might also be desperate to impress their mother (Sinead Cusack), who has maybe eight lines of dialogue here and still manages to terrify. But overall, the film doesn’t know what to do with Napoleon. Sometimes it seems like a serious epic designed to shine up his well-established mythology. At other times, it feels like a sneaky comic challenge to the Great Man theory of history, puncturing Napoleon’s sense of world-historical fate — his belief that he is the inheritor of Alexander the Great and Caesar — with glimpses into his awkwardness and overcompensations. The film is on much firmer ground in its depiction of the military campaigns, where Scott’s craft overcomes Scarpa’s uncertainty. Fans of the Battle of Austerlitz will find everything they want here, and maybe more, as Scott delivers expertly conceived, shot and edited war scenes, created almost entirely with practical effects. There are very few CGI cheats here, with the film using actual human actors, not pixels, to embody the deep horror and visceral physical brutality of war. Scott combines the larger sweep of tactics with close, kinetic camerawork that brings the viewer right into the chaos of hand-to-hand combat, with the ugly deaths and the screaming horses slipping in blood. It’s an accomplishment, but a difficult one to take in at this particular moment. With the world currently at war, real war, some viewers might find these cinematic battle scenes hit differently. Studying at the University of Winnipeg and later Toronto’s York University, Alison Gillmor planned to become an art historian. She ended up catching the journalism bug when she started as visual arts reviewer at the Winnipeg Free Press in 1992. There is genuine comedy here and also a real measure of pathos. Too often, though, Napoleon’s withering condemnation of its subject feels less like a meaningful conclusion than a narrative dodge, a convenient way to sidestep a more trenchant, complicated look at Napoleon’s political legacy. Ridley Scott — the Wellington of cinema — has created an outrageously enjoyable cavalry charge of a movie, a full-tilt biopic of 21/2 hours in which Scott doesn’t allow his troops to get bogged down mid-gallop in the muddy terrain of either fact or metaphysical significance, the tactical issues that have defeated other filmmakers. “History,” said Napoleon Bonaparte, “is a set of lies agreed upon.” That sound you hear 200 years later is Ridley Scott banging his fist on a table with appreciation before shooting a scene in which the man known as “The Nightmare of Europe” literally fires a cannon at the Great Pyramid of Giza.

In the turn-based strategy video game series Civilization, the goal is to lead people to victory from the dawn of time to the modern age, whether through war, scientific advancement, cultural hegemony or religious domination. Each available “civ” comes with unique skills, buildings and units, alongside a leader specific to that nation — Teddy Roosevelt for the Americans, or Mahatma Gandhi for India, for example — who comes with their own set of bonuses. Some civs have the option of two or more leaders, and players can fiddle the gameplay rules to divorce leaders from their nation, having, say, Saladin lead the Christian armies of the Holy Roman Empire. In the most recent iteration of the game, Civilization VI, leader bonuses are useful but provide far less of a net positive than the civilizational bonuses. In other words, the people one leads as a player are of more importance than the actual leader. As a function of game design, it’s a subtle but effective repudiation of the “Great Man” school of historiography, which supposes that highly powerful individuals are the defining factors in the development of world-shifting historical events; a category often bestowed upon Napoleon Bonaparte, the subject of Ridley Scott’s latest historical epic. This is a figure who, after all, inspired much of the “Great Man’” historical school, and whose previous biopics themselves often replicate the common idea of Napoleon as a unique, culturally-potent and earth-shifting figure. The opposite to the “Great Man” theory suggests that it is the history of the masses, colored with less perceptible cultural and social shifts, that defines history, priming the ground also for these iconic individuals to take their place; they are merely products of their environment, for better or worse. “Great Man” history is, in a sense, easier to digest, understand and make palatable. Heroic (or villainous) figures, existing outside of time, define an era, and produce a great deal more cultural ephemera — news items, artistic works, political responses — for future historians to parse through. Two-and-a-bit centuries down the line, we know intimate details of Napoleon’s biography, but we barely know the names of many of those who stormed the Bastille on that fateful day on July 14, 1789, kickstarting the French Revolution from which Napoleon would emerge. But “Great Man” history also makes figures more abstracted and totemic: positive figures such as Nikola Tesla become icons for nationalist state building in both Serbia and Croatia, while “Great Man” writing on figures like Adolf Hitler or Joseph Stalin flattens their crimes into historically exceptional acts, obscuring the levels of complicity and agreement within the populace over which they rule. The Hollywood historical epic has always had plenty to say about these “Great Men” (and the odd woman too), and Scott has long been one of historical epic’s most accomplished practitioners. His willingness to play with the conventions of the genre, even with a mega-budget production, is precisely why this biopic, starring Joaquin Phoenix as the man himself, is so refreshing, as Napoleon is very much a repudiation and a revolt against history’s “Great Men.” Scott’s vision of Napoleon Bonaparte is that of a passenger in his own story. He rises through the ranks of the post-Revolutionary French army largely on the coattails of more politically savvy allies; he spends significant sections of the film just wandering through scenes looking at things or people, unwilling or incapable of engaging with them; he is cuckolded by his wife Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) and enraged when she is unable to bear a child. Hell, Napoleon’s crowning of himself as the Emperor of France — arguably the defining moment of his life — is depicted almost glibly, in a brief scene where one of the subject’s leading diplomats, Talleyrand (Paul Rhys), casually suggests he should be Emperor. Cut to the next scene at the coronation of Napoleon and Josephine. No political machinations, no negotiations, no monologues — just one cut to the next. Perhaps this is partly a remnant of the fact that Napoleon has supposedly been cut down to two hours and 38 minutes for theatrical release from a four-hour director’s cut (which Scott plans to release on Apple TV+), but it’s a running theme in the theatrical cut that history happens to Napoleon, rather than Napoleon making and shaping history. The effect makes for a fascinatingly strange historical biopic in which key events land with no impact. This is not necessarily a bad thing — in fact, it separates Napoleon from other epics of its kind, creating an ahistoricism that says more about the historiography and perception of the subject than his actual life and actions (if you want to find out more about that, Napoleon remains one of the most written-about figures in world history).  There is a glimmer of truth in Scott’s presentation of Napoleon as a historical passenger. France is one of the world’s longest running states and political units, and the development of the French state is vitally important to the development of modern-day ideas about nations, peoples and ethnicities (often for the worse, if you ask me). In spite of violent revolutions, ruptures and wars, the French state has existed in some form or other since the Capetian era in the 10th century. The French Revolution in 1789 may have abolished the monarchy, but it did not abolish the state itself. Even events such as Vichy France, the rump state of France which functioned as a Nazi puppet state during WWII, exists as part of a continuity of the French state, with the institutions continually proving far more resilient than its people or leaders. Scott’s Napoleon suggests this throughout; political bickering, the general’s military command and his relationship to Josephine are all superseded by the concerns and power of the state. The film’s central protagonist is rarely the center of the scene, even when Phoenix’s leathered face fills the screen in a widescreen close-up. Phoenix’s performance is also a superb repudiation of historical epic expectations. He plays Napoleon small (and not just physically). The subject is a weirdo, with a wobbly voice and an unsure presence in rooms of power. This is a continuation of Phoenix’s recent work in Joker (2019) and Beau is Afraid (2023), where he also plays outcasts who end up as part of journeys far larger than themselves. Amidst all this, Scott ensures a glorious sheen of opulence throughout Napoleon. His greatest skill as a director has always been his marshalling of production design and cinematography to create unmistakably filmic settings (whether sci-fi or historical), even at the expense of tighter plotting or narrative tension. Light streams in through musty windows, dripping in through exquisite sets, lighting up charismatic actors (Kirby’s Empress Josephine is a particular highlight) in beautiful costumes. Meanwhile the battle scenes may be some of the best action scenes in Scott’s filmography, with huge set-pieces built largely on physical effects and a concrete sense of geography. Where are rival armies approaching from? Where are Napoleon’s men? Where is the momentum of battle? The staging is crystal-clear and gloriously bloody, which makes it all the more fascinating how differently and muddily Scott opted to present the rest of Napoleon’s life. Traditional historians have already been raging at the historical inaccuracies present in Napoleon. But in its rejection of the subject’s “Great Man” status, Scott offers a refreshing analysis of the uselessness of this sort of historiography. In Civilization VI, one gains access to different sorts of buildings and boosts. Basic granaries give way to bustling mega-cities; amphitheatres pave the way for art museums and then broadcast centers; libraries provide the foundation for universities and research labs. The game’s developers have presented this as a continuum on which a people exist and build a political identity for themselves. Scott suggests that Napoleon doesn’t exist as a unique individual, but as one of a continuum of state-building and historical cause-and-effect. Just another actor, and not the star.

"Nov 28, 2023",positive," Con una duración de dos horas y 38 minutos, la película abarca desde los orígenes humildes de Napoleón hasta sus más grandes conquistas, pasando por sus intrigas políticas y sus pasiones amorosas.  Si el cine se hiciera de manera similar a la comida, y existiera una receta de un plato “a lo Ridley Scott”, tomando como ingredientes sus fetiches y recursos, Napoleón (2023) podría ser el plato principal de un menú ejecutivo por el que muchas personas pagarian grandes cantidades de dinero.  La película es un festín visual que combina la espectacularidad de las batallas, algo recurrente en la filmografía del director, y el carisma de sus protagonistas. Joaquin Phoenix interpreta a un Napoleón complejo, lleno de ambiciones pero con inseguridades, vulnerable frente al amor que tiene por su esposa pero firme en su búsqueda de gloria, mientras que Vanessa Kirby interpreta a una Josefina delicada, manipuladora y elegante. El guión de David Scarpa integra al relato diálogos ingeniosos, momentos de humor y drama, y una narrativa ágil que se mantiene en gran parte de la cinta, aunque caiga por momentos. Scott recrea el contexto histórico de la Revolución Francesa y el Imperio Napoleónico (con algunas libertades), utilizando impresionantes escenarios, vestuarios y efectos especiales. La banda sonora, compuesta por Hans Zimmer, acompaña la acción con ritmo y emoción, otro invitado recurrente dentro de sus proyectos pasados. Napoleón podría ser la Gladiador (2000) de los tiempos modernos en muchos aspectos. Ambas películas son dramas históricos, narran la vida de un hombre extraordinario que se enfrenta a un destino adverso. Ambas tienen un protagonista carismático, interpretado por Phoenix, que lucha por su honor, su libertad y su amor. Ambas muestran escenas de batallas impresionantes, que combinan la acción, la violencia y la estrategia; y ambas tienen un final trágico y conmovedor, que nos deja con una sensación de admiración y melancolía."

"Nov 28, 2023",positive,The junction of this sort of brutal and ultraviolent classicism with an actor in his prime makes Napoleon a colossal film. [Full review in Spanish]
"Nov 28, 2023",negative," After the violent throes of revolution, in a bankrupt French Republic on the brink of collapse, a man captured the hearts of his people and rose to rule. This is the story of Napoleon Bonaparte, the subject of director Ridley Scott’s new movie, Napoleon, in theaters for Thanksgiving. Napoleon was one of the most fascinating people in history. Unfortunately, for all its big-budget set pieces and stars, Scott’s film is underdeveloped and confused—in its basic historical storytelling, but, more importantly, in what it has to say about its subject and the meaning of his life. Napoleon begins with the bloody fall of the French monarchy and, with it, the head of its famous queen Marie Antoinette. From there, we meet Napoleon (Joaquin Phoenix), a lowborn but ambitious officer who seizes his chance to rise to power in the chaotic aftermath of the revolution. The movie follows the major beats of his life point by point, from his first military success at Toulon to his final exile on the island of Saint Helena. Scott pushes through these phases in confusing succession. From Toulon, which is in France, Napoleon is suddenly in Egypt. If you’re a student of 18th- and 19th-century Europe and its constant power struggles, you know Napoleon campaigned through Egypt to weaken France’s rival Great Britain by nipping at their Middle Eastern holdings. But if you don’t already know this context, you simply see Napoleon with the Great Sphinx at Giza—and likely wonder what he’s doing there and why. Also strangely handled is Napoleon’s conflicted love affair with Josephine, the woman he made Empress of the French, then later abandoned. Their story is the stuff of legend, one of history’s great enigmas: They remained deeply connected after their divorce, and her death devastated him. His name was reportedly among the last words she spoke in life. But Napoleon’s script tells rather than shows much of this world-historic romance. As Josephine, Vanessa Kirby (formerly Princess Margaret in The Crown) is radiant as usual, but some of the dialogue between her character and Napoleon was so awkward it elicited laughs from the audience in my screening—and not the good kind. Phoenix plays Napoleon as a cold, silent strongman, at times a brute. He’s an excellent actor in the right role, but this portrayal doesn’t get us any closer to understanding the phenomenon that was Napoleon. Why did his people love him so fervently? Why, for that matter, did Josephine? Napoleon’s Napoleon is wholly without appeal, leaving the film without a theory of his rise to power that viewers could consider applying to powerful figures of our own time. That central lack is a shame because Napoleon has some strong elements. If a glorious cavalry charge—pennants streaming, hooves thundering, sabers flashing in the sun—is what you like in a historical epic, this movie is for you. Scott gives each war scene special attention, from the placement of artillery to the bitter cold of the Russian invasion. Battle nerds will be pleased. More military-focused excerpts of the film could be useful for high school students of European history. It’s unclear what went wrong with Napoleon. A good director, a very capable cast, and an epic scale in production come together to make something less than the sum of their parts. Maybe recent strikes in Hollywood hampered the post-production editing, or maybe the participants just didn’t meld. Whatever the reason, the film has moments that could have been profound. Napoleon’s encounter with the monuments of long-dead, ancient pharaohs could have been a meditation on the fleeting lives of even the most successful of ambitious men. Instead, the moment passes without that depth. The movie also leaves out any mention of faith. Without prior knowledge, a viewer could almost finish the film never knowing there were priests and churches in the land of Notre Dame. The French Revolution shook the church as much as the monarchy, but in this telling, the church seems to have never existed. Scott does show Napoleon’s grand rebellion of placing the crown on his own head rather than submitting to the church’s placement of the crown, but the movie does not show why that mattered. Napoleon could speak to us today. He arose in a time of populism, unrest, revolution. He captured a country’s imagination, both feeding and feeding on its self-narrative of greatness. Ultimately, he failed his people—and blamed them for that failure. Fill in a few context clues from Wikipedia, and Napoleon can provide a serviceable history lesson. But it could have been epic in more than its battles; it could have been an epic tale of a man who almost gained the whole world. Napoleon has several sex scenes, though they are brief. There are a few moments of gore, as would be expected in a movie about pre-modern European wars. The violence is generally muted, but it adds up to enough for an R rating."
"Nov 28, 2023",neutral," Another in a long list of flawed and boring movies about the Emperor of France, I could hardly sit through Ridley Scott’s Napoleon with my eyes open. I prefer both the classic 1927 silent film by Abel Gance and the 1954 flop Desiree with Marlon Brando as a miscast but memorable Bonaparte and rapturous Jean Simmons as Desiree Clary, the fiancee he should have married, who became Queen of Sweden, instead of the trashy, adulterous Josephine, who broke his heart and allegedly died of a nasty combination of diphtheria and syphilis. None of this, nor anything else that threatens to take Napoleon off the battlefield long enough to tell a moving or human story, is detailed enough to concern producer-director Ridley Scott, who is more interested in overloaded and overpopulated war scenes than illuminating history. The result is a colossal bore that is never passionate, exciting, sexy or entertaining, with an ill-fated titled performance by Joaquin Phoenix that borders on catatonic. The tedium begins in 1794 when Robespierre’s reign of terror, symbolized by gambling and guillotines, ignited the French Revolution and war hero Napoleon Bonaparte was promoted to brigadier general of the French Republic. There is no mention of Desiree, but when he meets Josephine, she spreads her legs and says, “If you look down, you’ll see a surprise. Once you see it, you’ll always want it.”  Whatever it is, I guess he likes it because he marries the trollop in Corsica, liberates Egypt, declaring, “I’m a brute that is nothing without you,” and by 1799, seizes power and divides the government with Josephine at his side.  Thus begins a dull history lesson, from the Battle of Austerlitz in 1805 to the disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812, a defeat with 28,000 French losses. If this movie has any basis in fact, Napoleon’s conquests and failures were the most boring in history. Louis the 18th demanded his arrest, but French troops embraced him with loyalty. One battle after another, and he declared himself Emperor of France, leading up to the eventual Battle of Waterloo and yet another arsenal of cannons, swords and exploding horses with their guts blown all over the landscape.  Screen titles inform you what battle you’re watching, but the armies all look alike, so you never know who Napoleon is fighting or why. The longer it goes on, the more exasperated and emotionally uninvolved Joaquin Phoenix becomes, and the more I look at my watch. The only impressive thing about Ridley Scott’s direction is the masses of extras he employed—thousands of them. Even if they were paid as little as $10 an hour, the budget must have been astronomical. One battle scene follows the next, and we are forced to live through every one of them.  Through it all, the acting remains muted and forgettable, except for the eye-rolling over-emoting of Vanessa Kirby, a Josephine who is always on the verge of hysterics. The screenplay by David Scarpa is dreary and turgid, hopping around episodically without any character development and evoking only a sketchy picture of Napoleon’s historic rise and fall and his nasty, violent marriage to Josephine. There is nothing here to engage the heart, nothing to explain or demonstrate the qualities that made him charismatic enough to captivate France.

"Nov 28, 2023",positive," “Boney’s old bird caught out of the nest again,” reads an 1812 newspaper headline in Ridley Scott’s Napoleon, cutting to the heart of the French emperor’s tempestuous romance with his wife, Josephine. The film delivers one whopping epic sight after another: the pyramids smoking like the Twin Towers after being fired on by cannons; an army of Austrians plunging through the ice at Austerlitz; the mud and blood of Waterloo. But what you most take away from the film is the sight of Napoleon Bonaparte on all fours, snorting like a pig, scampering towards the open legs of his wife. “You’re a beast,” she murmurs. The conqueror is conquered."
"Nov 28, 2023",negative,"Napoleon is protracted, as if running time and rambling narrative incidents amounted to substance. Napoleon parades an empty spectacle for a market uninterested in learning from history."
"Nov 28, 2023",negative," It’s tempting to suggest that director Ridley Scott’s decision to tell the story of Napoleon Bonaparte using short fragments is a tongue-in-cheek salute to the one-time French emperor’s physical stature. Bonaparte has become an icon of short-form masculinity, to the extent that the term Napoleon complex (also known as small people syndrome) is named after him and describes aggressive behaviour that seeks to overcompensate for physical or social shortcomings. However, the fact is Bonaparte wasn’t short. The enduring image of him being a tiny, disgruntled man is thanks to the popularity of the work of British cartoonist James Gillray. In reality, Bonaparte was approximately the same height as Joaquin Phoenix, who is the protagonist of the sprawling biopic, Napoleon.  This scrap of factual accuracy might just be a coincidence. For the better part of Napoleon, Scott is not bothered by prosaic things like historical record, despite the regular captions that inform us of years and locations. The director’s response to the news that French critics had pointed out inaccuracies in Napoleon was one that hummed with adolescent belligerence — “Were you there? Oh, you weren’t there. Then, how do you know?” Take that, all ye historians including Michael Broers, historical consultant on Napoleon who, when asked about Scott’s take on Bonaparte, delicately opined that his professional opinion as the author of a three-volume biography of Bonaparte is “not quite that”. In all fairness, there is arguably enough scholarship on Napoleon Bonaparte for those interested in a straightforward biography and woe betide anyone who turns to Hollywood for lessons on European history. What is more interesting to note are the areas in which Scott has chosen to veer away from historical realism and where he’s leaned towards authenticity. Napoleon begins with Queen Marie Antoinette walking up to the guillotine while a mob bays for her blood. From the crowd to the 18th-century Parisian square and the decapitated head that is triumphantly displayed, everything feels chillingly accurate. The fictional detail is the sight of Napoleon in the crowd. Factually speaking, he was in Toulon (which is where the narrative jumps to soon after the opening scene). There’s no explanation for why Scott felt the need to tweak history and begin with the French queen’s beheading — unless the motivation really was as simple as reducing violence on a female body into a casual spectacle.  The lavish budget and ambitious scope of Scott’s cinematic ambitions are evident in the panoramic shots of wars that gouged tranquillity out of pristine landscapes, like the windswept grassy plains around Waterloo and the snow-blanketed, fog-wrapped Russian countryside. There’s a sequence in which a group of soldiers fall through a frozen lake to their death, turning from human figures into abstracts made up of unnatural angles, slow swirls of red blood and jagged shards of white ice. Cinematographer Dariusz Wolski filmed the terrible beauty of this scene in a way that manages to be both the stuff of enchantment and also horror. Whether or not this is actually what happened in the battlefields where the legend of Bonaparte was created, Scott’s recreations of the war scenes feel both real as well as credibly dramatic.  Then there is the fiction, like Joaquin Phoenix, fixed in the amber of his late-40s, playing Napoleon from the ages of 24 to 51. Or Vanessa Kirby, 35, who is charismatic enough as Josephine to make you turn a blind eye to facts. Never mind that the real Josephine was six years older than Bonaparte and didn’t have the equivalent of Kirby’s cutglass, posh accent. The historical Josephine spoke French in a Creole twang — she was born to a family of white settlers in the French colony of Martinique. Her accent didn’t endear her to the Parisian elite. She survived an uprising in the colonised island, made her way to mainland France, navigated elite French society and emerged from the French Revolution and Reign of Terror as a widow with a prison record and two children. From here, Josephine became the Empress of France. At age 46, after almost 15-odd years of marriage, Josephine was forced to consent to a divorce from Bonaparte, who wanted heirs. (Ironically, while there are no legitimate direct descendants of Bonaparte’s line, Josepine is counted as an ancestor by the modern Dutch, Swedish, Norwegian and Belgian royal families.) None of this is of interest to Scott, who sees Josephine only as a vague embodiment of feminine distraction. She is the love of his Napoleon’s life and the military genius’s Achilles heel; a chesty temptress whose careless infidelity distracts Napoleon from key campaigns and reduces him to a howling mess. She is the lover with whom Napoleon does baby-talk and the woman who can go from submissive to dominatrix in the space of an exhale. Napoleon relies heavily on the famously passionate love letters that Bonaparte wrote to Josephine while they were married, to give the film an emotional charge, but the longing in the words feels awkwardly dissociated from the action on screen.  Despite two powerhouse performers delivering compelling performances, Napoleon and Josephine’s relationship rarely feels either coherent or poignant. There are only fragmentary moments that crackle with electricity. Their relationship zig zags erratically, moving from attraction to distaste to violence without a perceptible connecting thread. One of Scott’s many tweaks to history is in the scene where the imperial marriage is dissolved. Having repeatedly suggested Napoleon is hopelessly in love with Josephine while Josephine only tolerates him because she’s a dependant, the couple are shown to have settled into a comfortable unhappiness when they decide to end their marriage. The historical record says the divorce ceremony had an audience of witnesses before whom Napoleon and Josephine read out statements of devotion to one another before dissolving their marriage. Josephine was in tears while reading her statement. Scott adds a detail: He has Napoleon slap Josephine when she breaks down, creating a moment that is unsettling for both how jarring and fleeting Napoleon’s viciousness feels. Much like the decision to include Marie-Antoinette’s beheading in Napoleon, Scott’s reworking of history in this case can only be described as disappointing.  Had Scott been interested in Josephine’s perspective, maybe this fictional love story would have come across as poignant and conflicting. Unfortunately, Scott has little interest in interiority and this is not just true of Josephine. Even Phoenix doesn’t get much scope to build a nuanced character. Instead, his Napoleon ricochets from year to year, war to war, ever grumpy and never changing. The transitions are few and the pace is jumpy. David Scarpa’s script feels more like a Powerpoint presentation made out of Spark Notes than the recounting of a storied life. One moment, Napoleon asks his young new wife, “Would you like to see the bedroom?” The next moment, a newborn infant is brought to him. In one scene, Napoleon seems to command the affection and loyalty of French soldiers even though his military strategies used them as cannon fodder. Moments later, he’s lost his troops and is being exiled. Despite the excellent battle scenes, which make majestic use of the big screen, the film leaves one with little sense of what made Bonaparte a military genius and there is no mention at all of any of his actual contributions to French polity. Not that the 160 minutes that Scott devotes to Bonaparte feel well-spent, but considering how dramatic and eventful this life was, perhaps it would have been served better as a series, rather than a film. "
"Nov 27, 2023",positive," Napoleón (Estados Unidos-Reino Unido/2023). Dirección: Ridley Scott. Guión: David Scarpa. Fotografía: Dariusz Wolski. Música: Martin Phipps. Edición: Claire Simpson y Sam Restivo. Elenco: Joaquin Phoenix, Vanessa Kirby, Tahar Rahim, Rupert Everett, Edouard Philipponnat, Catherine Walker, Ludivine Sagnier. Distribuidora: UIP. Duración: 158 minutos. Calificación: solo apta para mayores de 13 años, con reservas. Nuestra opinión: buena. “Yo no soy como el resto de los hombres”, le advierte Napoleon Bonaparte a la viuda Josephine de Beauharnais mucho antes de la transformación de ese casi anónimo capitán de artillería en el hombre más poderoso de Europa y de buena parte del mundo conocido a comienzos del siglo XIX. La imagen todavía se instala en los tramos iniciales de este nuevo acercamiento del cine a una figura histórica de ribetes extraordinarios, cuyo retrato Ridley Scott quiere atrapar desde una doble dimensión: la del oficial que se apoya en su arrogancia y su genial talento de estratego militar para construir su destino de gloria y poder y la del hombre atormentado por toda clase de miedos, fobias e inseguridades, sobre todo en el terreno afectivo y amoroso. Es una empresa muy ambiciosa la de Scott, un director al que le gusta mirarse en el espejo de los personajes de sus películas, sobre todo aquellas que lleva adelante con un despliegue de producción poco común para estos tiempos. Con sus proyectos a gran escala, como el que se estrena hoy, Scott se muestra como una anomalía en el cine actual. Su mirada sobre algunos grandes hechos y momentos históricos suena casi anacrónica, como si quisiese recuperar en toda la línea aquel modelo de superproducción internacional tan característico de fines de la década de 1950 y comienzos de la siguiente, respaldado por un enorme dispositivo técnico y humano que se aprecia en el cuadro con toda su magnitud y no tiene, al menos a primera vista, una dependencia visible de la tecnología digital. A Scott le encanta filmar grandes batallas, choques y enfrentamientos en espacios abiertos aprovechando toda la dimensión que le ofrece la pantalla grande y dar a través de ellas la impresión de que allí solo hay hombres y máquinas en movimiento en vez de efectos visuales que transforman esa realidad en un vistoso artificio. El mayor atractivo de la película aparece en estas imponentes escenas de masas, que Scott registra como es su costumbre con multiplicidad de cámaras y un trabajo de edición que surge del propio rodaje. A este método, el realizador le agrega una dosis de realismo que las viejas superproducciones históricas de Hollywood no tenían. Ver, por ejemplo, cómo Napoleón se levanta y sigue adelante con todo el uniforme ensangrentado después de que un impacto de cañón despedaza literalmente a su caballo en plena batalla marca diferencias entre el pasado y la actualidad. El director se enojó en los últimos días con algunos comentaristas que le reprocharon una serie de aparentes imprecisiones históricas y dijo que su propósito no pasa por ser fiel a esos libros. Pero el espectador, después de seguir el recorrido histórico que la película propone a través de una sucesión bastante cuidadosa de episodios bélicos (de las grandes victorias en Tolón y Austerlitz a la catastrófica campaña rusa y la capitulación final en Waterloo), se sentirá estimulado a comparar lo que aquí se cuenta con el relato de los historiadores. El recorrido por estas tres décadas y media decisivas en la historia de Occidente dominadas por la figura de Napoleón tiene unos cuantos agujeros y habrá que esperar a la prometida versión integral de cuatro horas que Scott llevará al streaming (Apple aportó el dineral invertido en la producción) para taparlos. La mayoría de los personajes históricos aparecen apenas delineados y con escaso espesor, como si fueran nada más que figuras circunstanciales o sencillamente decorativas. Detrás de toda esta descripción general aparece el otro aspecto al que Scott le presta atención. El Napoleón íntimo, doméstico, inseguro, casi desesperado por ganarse para siempre el corazón de una mujer que sabe al mismo tiempo que va a engañarlo. Todo ese festival de arrebatos, impulsos, caprichos y reacciones inesperadas pertenece más por momentos a la personalidad de Joaquin Phoenix que a la del personaje que interpreta. A su lado, Vanessa Kirby se esfuerza (a veces de un modo demasiado elocuente) para mostrar cómo una personalidad tan voluble como la de Josephine se va tornando cada vez más introvertida, sobre todo cuando siente que no puede darle un heredero al Napoleón ya coronado emperador. Las dos dimensiones de Napoleón que atrajeron a Scott también esperan la versión integral. En estos 158 minutos de película no logran congeniarse de la manera esperada en una obra que pretende hacer revisionismo con conceptos de otra época, como lo es escuchar a los franceses del siglo XIX hablando todo el tiempo en perfecto inglés. © Copyright 2024 SA LA NACION | Todos los derechos reservados.

"Nov 27, 2023",positive," “Napoleón”, la más reciente producción del gran cineasta británico Ridley Scott (“Alien”, “Blade Runner”, “Gladiador”, “La casa de Gucci”), no está en lo absoluto interesada en la precisión histórica. El mismísimo Scott se ha encargado de decirlo, y los críticos franceses ciertamente también lo han manifestado (y no están muy felices por ello). Lo cual, siendo honestos, es válido —después de todo, “Napoleón” es una obra de ficción, BASADA en una historia real; no un documental. No obstante, cuando se presenta un filme como algo basado en hechos reales, TAMBIÉN es válido esperar que se parezca, aunque sea, a lo que sucedió de verdad, por más de que algunos detalles sean omitidos o cambiados. ¿Qué quiero decir con esto? Pues que nadie debería considerar a “Napoleón” como una lección de historia. Y mucho menos deberían basar su percepción del famoso general francés en la interpretación de Joaquin Phoenix, bajo la dirección de Scott. Quizás podría servir como un punto de partida para que se animen a leer o investigar más sobre la figura histórica; de hecho, me encanta cuando un filme ayuda a generar más interés en hechos o personajes de la vida real. Pero como bien dice el dicho: nunca dejes que la realidad se ponga en el camino de una buena historia. Y parece que esa ha sido la filosofía principal de Scott a la hora de dirigir “Napoleón”: un filme que quizás no sea muy preciso a nivel histórico, pero que felizmente funciona bastante bien como una pieza de ficción. La película comienza a finales del siglo dieciocho, con Napoleón Bonaparte (Phoenix) siendo testigo de la ejecución de Maria Antonieta como culminación de la Revolución Francesa. Luego de aquel evento, el general se convierte en uno de los principales defensores de la República, dirigiendo una serie de victorias en contra de los enemigos de Francia. Es así que somos testigos del ascenso de Napoleón dentro del ejército francés, mientras se enamora y eventualmente casa con Josefina (Vanessa Kirby), con quien mantiene una relación tóxica de obsesión. “Napoleón” se concentra, pues, tanto en la vida militar como en la vida personal de Bonaparte, y su relación con el éxito, la violencia, y su obsesión tanto con su esposa, como con el patriotismo. No resulta difícil darse cuenta de por qué los franceses no son fanáticos de “Napoleón”. Se trata de un filme que presenta al personaje del título como un genio de la estrategia militar, sí, pero también como un hombre obsesionado por una mujer, con tendencias a hacer berrinches, tener interacciones incómodas con extraños, e ignorar a quienes considera como inferiores. Mucha de la grandeza con la que la gente relaciona a Napoleón está ausente en la película —especialmente considerando que no incluye muchas de sus victorias militares, más bien favoreciendo escenas románticas o de conflicto sexual con Josefina. Me imagino, pues, que a muchos fanáticos de la historia y críticos franceses no les hico gracia ver DOS escenas de sexo en las que Napoleón no es representado como el mejor de los amantes, precisamente. Sin embargo, en el contexto que Scott ha logrado desarrollar, todos estos elementos ya mencionados logran pintar a Napoleón como un hombre complicado, con el que, curiosamente, no resulta difícil empatizar. Sí, es el tipo de hombre que cree que el fin justifica los medios, y que está tan obsesionado con una supuesta paz en Europa, que sería capaz de matar a millones de personas para obtenerla (y de hecho lo hizo). Pero en su vida personal, es presentado de forma tan patética y hasta desesperada, que uno termina entendiendo a esta versión de Napoleón como alguien con una relación complicada con las mujeres (tanto su madre como Josefina). Es casi como un adolescente; nuevamente, algo que seguramente no le hizo mucha gracia al público francés. Eso sí, vale la pena mencionar que, a pesar de que las escenas de conflicto personal resultan fascinantes por cómo han sido escritas y, por supuesto, gracias a la dirección de Scott, desgraciadamente la química entre Phoenix y Kirby no es la mejor. Se supone que su relación está llena de pasión —más por parte de él que de ella—, y que la obsesión y el amor-odio son un componente importante de su romance. Sin embargo, nada de eso se transmite a través de las interacciones entre ambos actores; los dos dan actuaciones individuales bastante buenas, pero cuando están juntos, simplemente falta ese “je ne se quoi” que haría que el romance central termine por funcionar. Uno admira lo que Scott intentó hacer con ellos, pero desgraciadamente, no llega a SENTIRLO. Fuera de eso, “Napoleón” hace un excelente trabajo recreando las diferentes batallas en las que se vio involucrado Bonaparte, desde la Invasión de Rusia —incluyendo una trifulca sobre el hielo, y el incendio de Moscú— hasta, por supuesto, la infame Batalla de Waterloo. El filme le permite a Scott lucirse como un director de acción, presentándonos estas secuencias de violencia de manera cruenta, sin alejarse de la sangre o el gore para hacernos sentir lo horrible que es la guerra. Y en general, “Napoleón” es una cinta que luce muy bien, aprovechando el presupuesto que Apple le dio a Scott para incluir escenas en locaciones reales impresionantes, sets enormes, y con cientos o hasta miles de extras en pantalla. La película se siente como una producción épica casi “retro”, de gran envergadura y mayor escala. Como se dio a entender líneas arriba, Phoenix no está mal como Napoleón, interpretándolo como un hombre que se dedicó al arte de la guerra, pensando siempre en una supuesta paz que parecía estar cada vez más lejos de su realidad. Algunos han manifestado que Phoenix no fue la elección correcta para interpretar a Napoleón, y aunque si uno considera únicamente al personaje histórico probablemente eso sea cierto, me parece que el actor de “Joker”, más bien, fue la elección perfecta para ESTA versión de Napoleón. Por su parte, Vanessa Kirby interpreta a Josefina como una mujer sensual, ambiciosa y hasta ligeramente manipuladora. Y del reparto secundario, destacan Ben Miles (“Coupling”, “Andor”) como uno de los consejeros de Bonaparte, Paul Rhys (“Saltburn”) como Talleyrand, y el gran Rupert Everett (siempre da gusto verlo en una película nueva) como el Duque de Wellington. “Napoleón” es una película fascinante; una suerte de resumen de los grandes éxitos y notables fracasos del famoso comandante militar y eventual Emperador de Francia que, curiosamente, no parece estar muy interesado en la rigurosidad histórica. Más bien, lo que Scott ha hecho con esta película es desarrollar una narrativa más ficticia que históricamente precisa, en la que interpreta a Napoleón como un hombre brillante pero inseguro; ambicioso, pero dependiente y hasta obsesionado con su esposa. Visualmente es una experiencia magnífica, y las actuaciones son todas de buen nivel, pero a la vez, entiendo perfectamente por qué algunos no disfrutarían de “Napoleón”. Si se animan a verla, sugiero que se olviden de sus imprecisiones históricas, y la consideren como una versión extremadamente ficcionalizada de lo que pasó en la vida real. De esa manera, seguramente la pasarán bien con “Napoleón”. Comunicador audiovisual y crítico de cine.

"Nov 27, 2023",positive," My my. At Waterloo, Napoleon did surrender. Oh yeah, and for decades before that, General Bonaparte wreaked havoc across Europe, North Africa, and Russia, gaining a reputation as a genius, a despot, an icon, and a brute. There are literally thousands of books about Napoleon, as well as myriad films, TV series, songs, and memes dedicated to dissecting, parodying, and discoursing him. Everyone has an opinion of him. So, how do you even begin to make a new version of this well-worn tale? If you’re Sir Ridley Scott, you toss history to the side and delve into a heated mish-mash of battles, narcissism, sex, and hats.  If you’re looking for the utmost fealty to the past, this film is not for you. It opens with Napoleon (Joaquin Phoenix) witnessing the execution of Marie Antoinette at the height of the ‘Reign of Terror’ that defined the French Revolution. That didn’t happen. He didn’t fire cannons at the Pyramids of Giza, and he didn’t dine with the Duke of Wellington. This might bother some, but for me, Scott’s mythologizing of an already heavily propagandized life was crucial to what makes Napoleon work when it’s firing on all cylinders. For Scott, this is a classic rags-to-riches story to be retold and refuted at the same time.  Bonaparte is a lowly Corsican soldier and social misfit whose brilliance on the battlefield sees him claw his way to power. As is befitting a film made by the guy who brought us Gladiator, the battle scenes are stunning. He really does make this stuff look easy, as well as merciless. In the first battle — the film is structured around a number of key battles that defined Napoleon’s career — we see bodies flying and horses massacred in frighteningly detailed fashion. The death toll of each battle is evident; the mass suffering never ignored by the camera, even if Napoleon himself is indifferent to his men’s agonies. For all who worried that Napoleon would downplay or justify the body count of Bonaparte, do not fear. It’s clear that Scott and screenwriter David Scarpa are not impressed by how this man’s intense vanity led him to such lengths. The flipside of Bonaparte’s obsession with victory is his obsessive yearning for Josephine, played by Vanessa Kirby. He cannot live without her. She doesn’t seem all that into him, except as a means of protection for a former general’s wife in a post-revolution Paris. His adoration is tough to deal with, so it’s no wonder she quickly finds a new lover, which the entirety of France knows about long before Napoleon does. His uncouth nature is in stark contrast to the steely control of Josephine, as portrayed by Kirby as charismatic without even having to make an effort. Her stillness has an allure that could only work with an actress like Kirby, so used to doing everything with nothing.  Phoenix, by contrast, is an absolute f*cking loser, and it is amazing. Still using his valley boy American accent, his Napoleon is a self-mythologizing dork who is smart enough to craft his own legend but unaware that he’s just the absolute worst to be around. He’s pompous but too insecure to stand up to his own mother. When he bellows in one man’s face about thinking he’s so great because he has boats, the sheer absurdity of this man cannot be denied (it also helps that Phoenix is a brilliant slapstick performer, best seen in one moment where he runs away from a crowd like a Hanna Barbera character.) Speaking of absurdity, there are jokes in Napoleon. This is a funny movie, deliberately so. The contrast between the ceaseless violence of the battlefield and Napoleon’s stumbling through society and marital squabbles makes for a larger-than-life expansion of a marriage story. When Napoleon is on top of the world, the battles look easy. When he is forced to divorce Josephine for the crime of not being able to provide him with a son, the fights become agonizingly drawn out. His own ego is bruised, but it doesn’t make him consider the cost of his games.  The problem with reviewing a Ridley Scott movie is that you’re keenly aware he’ll have a director’s cut of the thing you just watched on the horizon and that it will be a much richer, denser experience. He’s really the only director working today who has the luxury to release a $200 million epic and then get a longer cut with more juicy stuff jam-packed in to that same crowd. Would that all our favourite filmmakers got that opportunity. And Scott has more than proven himself with these extended editions. Kingdom of Heaven became an outright masterpiece with its director’s cut. The much-maligned neo-noir The Counselor is more caustic and perverse in Scott’s unfettered take. You could write a thesis on the various cuts of Blade Runner and how they drastically change the narrative with each redo. There is a Napoleon director’s cut on the way, to be made available on Apple TV+, and I can’t wait to see it. But it’s disheartening that the theatrical cut of this film, the one the vast majority of people will see first, has to feel like a compromise to make it happen.  Because ultimately, this still feels like a four-hour film sliced into a 140-minute one. There’s not enough time with Josephine to give their relationship the heft it demands, which leaves Phoenix and Kirby to do a lot of heavy lifting with their conflicting chemistries. What we get is so striking and crucial to the entire point of Scott’s retelling of the Bonaparte story. It’s through this torrid romance, one with routine infidelities that the French newspapers endlessly reported on, that Napoleon’s impulses and desires are filtered. Their famed love letters are used as inner monologue voiceovers, offering a contrast of rhetoric to action in terms of their marriage, then reflected further in the battle scenes. But more is needed to maintain this balance. Here’s hoping the director’s cut satisfies.  A lot of critics seem irate at Napoleon for its take on history, so lackadaisical with the truth and far more concerned with the idea of this man than his reality. Maybe there’s no literal truth in Phoenix’s pompous tyrant brat with wife issues and big loser energy, but there is power to this version of a familiar story. Scott cares more about how the myth is made and who gets to make it, and we all know how often that is defined by men like this. Maybe he doesn’t deserve to be shown as anything more than an amoral loser with an emotional support hat."
"Nov 27, 2023",negative," Napoleon was a weepy, masochist, a so-so general who was forced to be named emperor. He loved only one woman and cried when he divorced her. He wanted Josephine instead of an heir for the Bonaparte dynasty. France will not forgive Ridley Scott for the insult. Beheading by guillotine was so common that for women subjected to this public death, the hair “style” was called the “coiffure à la victime.” Beheadings were big crowd pleasers. This final act shame was done by the executor right before the walk to the block. Marie Antoinette, heralded and cursed for her outrageous costumes, would have had her hair cut and arranged beforehand by her attendants. She had months to prepare after her husband met his end. Having her hair quickly chopped by the executor would have been for her far worse than the beheading!* When Napoleon first sees Josephine, her hair has been badly chopped. She was so close to death by guillotine that she had been prepared so her neck could be easily placed on the block.
 The French Revolution had finally deposed of the legendary monarchy. The imprisoned king, Louis XVI, believed the way to avoid his fate at the guillotine was to negotiate with the revolutionaries. He failed. But Queen Marie Antoinette refused, insisting “mon métier est d’être royaliste.” I am going to bypass the historical or non-historical recreations of the bloody battles and the route Napoleon took claiming the leadership, then throne, of France. I am going to focus on Napoleon’s relationship with Josephine, which is at the center of the film. Apparently, bringing France back to a monarchy, was not that difficult. Napoleon was not a ruthless, cruel politician. Scott/Scarpa refuse to accept how dominant he was. He cries bitterly when forced to have a male heir! He sobs signing the divorce papers! If he stayed married to Josephine, who could not provide him with an heir, he would be a one-time emperor, not the founder of the Bonaparte dynasty.
 Scott insists that Napoleon is nothing without Josephine (Vanessa Kirby). His letters to Josephine are sensual masterpieces and, at the time, flowery language of desire was intentional and proof of an aristocrat’s education. Do you think the French peasants had the time and education to write letters? Without being in someone’s company, there were no other means of promoting sexual arousal. It is like the “female centered” popularity of soft pornographic literature or erotic scenes in movies and series (see FELLOW TRAVELERS!) Even writing those letters must have excited Napoleon. He had to imagine those sexual things before writing them down. Then giving it away to travel thousands of miles to Josephine would have also thrilled him. The fear of his letters falling into enemy hands would have also added another dimension of heightened thrill. Josephine should be praised for evaluating Napoleon’s psychological weakness and exploiting it.  Cleverly, Josephine did not give Napoleon the honor and respect he was widely given. Josephine was an aristocrat. Napoleon was not. We know this because she boldly takes lovers when he is on campaigns and does not respond to his daily, pleading letters. She brilliantly toyed with him. Many of his authentic letters to Josephine, narrated by Phoenix, suggests the real reason for his obsession with his wife. He says in a letter that she is the only woman that can please him. What does that exactly mean? Did the already sexually sophisticated Josephine provide a service to Napoleon no innocent, convent-raised royal virgin would be familiar with? According to my research, the director and screenwriter have drawn a radical different Napoleon than history has presented. Historians state he had 21 confirmed mistresses. There were also persistent rumors that existed about his relationship to his stepdaughter, Hortense de Beauharnais and his own sister, Pauline Bonaparte, who it was said loved him more than her lovers. All over France it was whispered that Napoleon was occasionally impotent. At some dinner tables an acceptable topic of discussion was the exceptionally modest amount of Napoleon’s ejaculated semen and the size of his penis, disproportionate even to his diminutive stature.  NAPOLEON offers us an emperor who was not happy with his victories, the power, his place in history, and his desire for a dynasty. Only Josephine made him happy. He presents his newborn son to Josephine for her approval. Mommy, look! I did good!T he battle scenes, costumes, the production are brilliant. However, Phoenix has decided to besmirch the glory of Napoleon. Visit Napoleon’s tomb, Dôme des Invalides, in Paris. See the tribute the massive structure presents. The French do not see Napoleon as Scott does: as a pussy-whipped, cry-baby self-created emperor who might have had some so-so victories and was a depressed, discontented bore. *Consider this: After the monarchy was abolished, King Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, their children were housed in the Temple’s Small Tower, where they had access to some of the luxuries they were accustomed to — fine food and wine, new clothes, clean sheets, and books to read. The queen even had one of her beloved dogs in her rooms. When they moved once again to the Temple’s Great Tower, their living conditions were still agreeable; their rooms had a flushing toilet and wallpaper, and their food was served on silver. They had their servants."
"Nov 27, 2023",negative,"Napoleon, in reality, tells nothing, investigates nothing, proposes nothing. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Nov 27, 2023",negative," Ridley Scott decepciona profundamente con su versión de Napoleón: es una película plana, tan profunda como una entrada de Wikipedia, y con dos actores por demás desperdiciados. Cuando iba a la secundaria (hace muchos, muchos años), si el profesor de educación física faltaba a clase (o caía una lluvia torrencial) nos mandaban a todos los alumnos al auditorio y, para entretenernos, nos ponían películas intrascendentes que en el mayor de los casos además eran aburridas. Lo anterior viene a cuento porque Napoleón (USA, UK, 2023), el largometraje 29 de la extensa filmografía Ridley Scott, me parece que tendrá el mismo destino que esas películas que me ponían en secundaria: aburrir adolescentes y actuar como sustituto de un profesor (o de un buen libro sobre el tema). La idea sonaba muy atractiva: Ridley Scott, el director de Los Duelistas (1977), de Gladiator (2000), de Kingdom of Heaven (2005) a cargo de realizar una película sobre Napoleón que además sería protagonizada por Joaquin Phoenix. ¿Dónde firmo? La mala noticia es que ninguno de los dos entrega lo esperado, que no es sino el nivel que ambos nos tienen acostumbrados en sus cintas previas. Como pocas veces, Scott peca de ser insustancialmente académico. La película es tal cual una sucesión de eventos, y en la mayoría de los mismos el director o no tiene tiempo, o no tiene presupuesto, o simplemente no le da la gana detenerse demasiado. Es, pa’ pronto, un wikipediazo de la biografía de Napoleón. La cinta inicia con el final de la revolución francesa y la decapitación de María Antonieta. Scott nos tiene reservado un lugar en primera fila para ver tan importante suceso sin que perdamos de vista una sola gota de sangre. Momentos después veremos como el caballo de Napoleón sufre una herida brutal y sangrienta. Scott insiste en que seamos testigos de cómo muere en batalla el pobre animal. Y en otra escena, el magnánimo Napoleón masacra a unos manifestantes a cañonazo limpio, aquí también le es importante a Scott que los veamos morir, pero más aún, nos muestra a los sobrevivientes, la mayoría ya sin un brazo o una pierna. Es la famosa era del terror ante la cual el Napoleón de Scott (y de Phoenix) observa sin inmutarse. Después viene su primera gran batalla (o al menos la primera en la película), la de Toulón. En las batallas Scott muestra su mejor cine, años de experiencia filmando a campo abierto lo avalan. Incluso no queda claro hasta qué punto lo que vemos es CGI o tomas reales. Bien ahí. Pero luego, de regreso a los diálogos en su mayoría insípidos, de vuelta a los letreritos en pantalla y las fechas en letra cursiva. De buenas a primeras Napoleón pasa de ser un don nadie a ser Don Napoleón, pero eso no le interesa mostrarlo a Scott ni su guión, escrito por David Scarpa. “El destino trajo a mi esta chuleta” dice en algún momento Napoleón. Probablemente sea el guión diciéndonos: “bueno ya, ustedes saben Napoleón se vuelve el gran conquistador, ¿qué caso tiene que les contemos lo que ya saben?” Lo que sí le interesa a Scott es su relación con Josefina. La conocemos despeinada, con el pelo corto pero alborotado, ex prisionera de la era del terror. Pero nada de ello importa, porque Josefina está interpretada por Vanessa Kirby, ¿y quién no se enamoraría de ella? Así inician (con voz en off) las famosas cartas de Napoleón a su amada Josefina. En esas misivas se siente la ardiente pasión del conquistador por la hermosa doncella, pero todo queda en palabras, porque en las imágenes Scott tampoco muestra mucho. Vanessa Kirby le roba la película a Phoenix,e incluso a Scott mismo, quien para esta versión (de dos horas y cuarenta minutos) decidió recortar mucho de su historia. Qué mal, porque en algún momento pensé que esto debió ser una película de Josefina y no de Napoleón. Aunque Kirby tampoco tiene mucho con qué trabajar, su presencia bien vale la entrada al cine, e incluso me atrevo a decir que hasta una nominación. Porque es claro que el principal objetivo de esta cinta son los Oscar, pero ni el director, ni Phoenix merecerían estar en ese podio. No por esta película. Kirby en cambio se adueña del show, conquista nuestra atención y le da a esta cinta la dosis de interés que tanto necesita. Mucho se ha comentado sobre el humor en la película, y en efecto, hay varios momentos donde es imposible no soltar la carcajada. No veo el problema en ello, al contrario, son pequeñas islas de entretenimiento en una película carente de texturas, plana en su relato, impersonal hasta decir basta, con un Joaquin Phoenix extrañamente calmado, que se ve bien en el traje pero que en realidad no aporta nada al personaje por el cual existe el llamado “complejo de Napoleón”. Phoenix claramente no quería caer en el cliché del “líder enloquecido”, pero vamos, ¡es Napoleón! Qué bien nos hubiera caído un poco del delirio de Joker (2019) o de Beau is Afraid (2023) en el Napoleón de Joaquin Phoenix. Al parecer hay una obsesión de Scott por recrear pinturas famosas de Napoleón. La escena de la coronación es idéntica a “La Consagración” de Jacques-Louis David, el pintor oficial del emperador y que en la película tiene un pequeñísimo cameo. Lo mismo se detiene en escenas como Napoleón frente a la esfinge, disparando cañonazos a las pirámides en Egipto, o inspeccionando un sarcófago. Ambas imágenes provienen de dos famosos cuadros de JL Gerome y Maurice Orange, respectivamente. Este Ridley Scott, juguetón, al que no le importa recrear escenas que (según la historia oficial) probablemente nunca sucedieron, es lo mejor que le puede pasar a la película. Pero se trata de apenas algunos momentos. El gran problema con Napoleón, la película, es que carece de la profundidad que el personaje merece. Aquí solo tendremos los hechos, no hay análisis, no hay profundidad, no hay en el horizonte siquiera una razón para que esta película exista. Al final, cuando ha llegado la famosa batalla de Waterloo (uno de los momentos más logrados de la cinta), no sabemos ni cómo llegamos aquí ni tampoco hemos descubierto nada nuevo sobre el personaje (a menos claro, que tengan cinco años, o sean los alumnos aburridos de secundaria a quienes les pusieron esta película). En los créditos finales, Scott hace recuento de los muertos en cada batalla napoleónica: un total de tres millones de personas muertas. Un dato que no aporta nada, como la película misma."
"Nov 27, 2023",neutral," Cuando Ridley Scott dice: “Haré una película con espadas y caballos”, uno sí o sí tiene que prestar atención. Este director es prácticamente una eminencia en lo que concierne a largometrajes ambientados en siglos pasados, inspirados en mitos, leyendas o auténticos pasajes de la historia humana donde el plato fuerte son los enfrentamientos cuerpo a cuerpo o las batallas de dimensiones épicas, mismas que Scott suele resolver sin escatimar en ningún recurso a favor del espectáculo. Así pues, al momento de ocupar su butaca para ver Napoleón, el público hará bien en esperar secuencias bélicas implacables e impecables que cautivan el oído y la mirada. No hay decepción cada que los cañones resuenan; ésa viene una vez que los rugidos se detienen. Casi cincuenta años después de su ópera prima Los duelistas (1977), Scott retorna al contexto de las Guerras Napoleónicas, ahora para contar la historia del mismísimo líder francés que dio nombre a tales incursiones militares, las cuales pusieron el continente europeo en la palma de su mano y conllevaron la muerte de millones de personas a comienzos del siglo XIX. De esta película, sin embargo, no hay que esperar una amena lección de historia, como bien ha señalado el también director de Gladiador y El último duelo. Abarcando casi tres décadas en la vida de Napoleón Bonaparte, el relato deviene particularmente apresurado en el abordaje de los acontecimientos importantes —a pesar de sus dos horas y media de duración— y poco amigable para aquellos espectadores que no tengan tan presente lo aprendido de sus libros de historia universal. El propósito de Scott era explorar más bien la idiosincrasia del personaje titular y su turbulenta relación con Josefina Bonaparte, lo cual sonaba muy atractivo en papel, pero en pantalla no consigue funcionar. La manera de retratar al general francés vuelto emperador es de mínimo descuidada en la biopic. Se percibe una intención (muy válida) de exhibir al protagonista como un hombre de muchas caras, pero al no profundizar en ninguna, cero oportunidad existe de adentrarnos en su psique. La versión de Ridley Scott es a veces la del estratega sereno y valeroso, a veces la del mandatario ambicioso y berrinchudo, y a veces la del marido celoso y lascivo, mostrado por medio de una serie de viñetas vanas y pobremente hiladas. Del lado favorable, Joaquin Phoenix logra darle a Napoleón cierto grado de personalidad unificadora que contrarresta lo disperso del montaje y del guion. Dicho sea de paso, su actuación podría recordar a la de Daniel Day-Lewis en El hilo fantasma por el modo en que ambos lidian con personajes encumbrados y engreídos, de talento innegable, pero inseguros y propensos a hacer rabietas que —conforme a la etiqueta— no cuadran con su estatus. El tono es un aspecto en el que Ridley Scott ya renqueaba desde La casa Gucci y tristemente su cojera no ha sanado. Con Napoleón, el cineasta británico da indicios en más de una ocasión de querer ridiculizar al comandante nacido en Córcega; caso curioso pues fueron los mismos ingleses quienes hace 200 años optaron por hacer caricaturas de aquel dirigente rival y en ellas subrayaban, entre otras cosas, su supuesta pequeñez. Sin embargo, Scott finalmente evita entregarse por completo a la sátira y decide mejor homenajear —mediante los vistosos encuadres de su director de fotografía Dariusz Wolski— un par de afamadas pinturas al óleo donde lejos de mofarse de Napoleón, se exalta su imagen de emperador y conquistador. La película cobijada por Apple TV Plus falla también en establecer un vínculo significativo entre la carrera militar del protagonista y su relación con Josefina Bonaparte. El planteamiento del director era que con sus campañas, Napoleón pretendía o ganarse el corazón de su amada, o destruirla al saberse rechazado. Pero ni las cartas leídas en voz en off ni las escenas que se intercalan acerca de su vida matrimonial sirven para sentir una conexión orgánica entre Josefina y la guerra librada por Napoleón en el extranjero. La emperatriz termina muy relegada, con un hermetismo que al menos Vanessa Kirby torna fascinante con su férrea interpretación. Ahora bien, la inmersiva ambientación y el meticuloso diseño de producción de Arthur Max no suelen trastabillar en una película de época de Ridley Scott, y Napoleón no es la excepción. La banda sonora original de Martin Phipps asimismo resulta una hipnótica acompañante en todo momento, sea en las situaciones más íntimas o en aquéllas de tensión y explosividad bélica. Tema aparte una alusión musical a Orgullo y prejuicio, de Joe Wright, que no pasará desapercibida. Ultimadamente, de lo mucho que se le ha reprochado al épico largometraje de Ridley Scott, las inexactitudes históricas son lo de menos. Dentro del rubro de la ficción, las licencias creativas están siempre a la orden del día, en aras de apoyar la visión o propuesta de un director que en realidad no tiene por qué apegarse forzosamente a lo que asumimos como verdadero. La cronología puede tergiversarse, al igual que todo conocimiento avalado en los anales de la historia, siempre y cuando haya un propósito, que en este caso podría ser la sátira o el estudio de las motivaciones, los demonios internos y demás rasgos de una de las figuras más trascendentes de la historia de Occidente. El problema es que Napoleón no tiene ni idea de a qué aspira.
