Mar 24 2024,positive,love all roberts films this one is no different
Mar 23 2024,neutral,pretty good photography not much of a story liked the trippy norse mythology stuff could have made a bit more of it
Mar 17 2024,positive,if the northman isnt robert eggers best movie its at least his boldest its finetuned and pinpoint beyond what youd expect from an already exacting director and the stunning ensemble cast is entirely dedicated to their profound roles  all led by alexander skarsgård and anya taylorjoy    
Mar 12 2024,positive,beautiful story of revenge very raw emotion and an all around great viking movie alexander skarsgård absolutely delivers in this and put so much into this and the supporting cast also holds up this captivating tale a must see for anyone who is into viking lore or a fan of alexander skarsgård
Mar 5 2024,positive,almost like a classic sword and sorcerer film but with no regard for the genres conventions which makes this film standout and stand above
Feb 29 2024,negative,mediocre pretty basic story nothing really surprising or departure from what youd expect forgettable
Feb 28 2024,positive,what a great surprise immersed in the beautiful and creative shoots i really loved this movie this movie made me remember why i love movies this much and inspired me in my cinematography
Feb 27 2024,negative,i do not  see what the critics see in this even with great cinematography it was not good
Feb 21 2024,positive,eggers finally fulfills the promise he showed in his earlier work a gorgeous and bold epic that both feels old fashioned possibly ancient even and excitingly new
Feb 14 2024,positive,because of its length lack of character development or even story depth it might not be everyones cup of tea but if you look at it from a different perspective than you usually look at movies you appreciate it for what it is a brutal revenge tale with great cinematography
Feb 9 2024,positive,in a landscape thats been very fond of vikings in recent years its nice to see a departure from the often poorly realised historical and instead venture into the mythical the fantastical    based on the story of amleth the original inspiration for shakespears hamlet this film is unapologetically cryptic and mysterious while telling a cohesive and thrilling tale    the wealth of historical accuracies to the time period are worth 5 stars in themselves seriously look it up but going into this film expect to see a work of fantasy and let yourself get lost in it you wont be disappointed
Feb 4 2024,negative,this movie was absolutely dreadful from start to finish the writing was completely incoherent and nonsensical none of the plot threads made any sense whatsoever the attempts at symbolism fell completely flat the tone shifted abruptly and inconsistently between scenes it honestly felt like the writer was just making things up as they went along with no planning or forethought    even setting aside the abysmal writing every other aspect of this movie was equally incompetent the acting was laughably bad the cinematography was amateurish the pacing was horrible the runtime was absurdly long considering there was no actual story being told the whole production comes across as some film students first attempt at an artistic movie that tries way too hard to be profound but ends up revealing only its own pretension    the northman has earned its place among the worst movies i have ever seen the writing is the most glaring weakness but every single component is flawed do not waste your time or money on this total disaster of a film easily one of the biggest cinematic misfires in recent memory
Feb 4 2024,negative,apparently some reviewers think a pretty movie must be a good movie  this one is visually sumptuous but plagued by long boring stretches the worst choreographed medieval fight scenes since movies in the 50s moderate acting nicole kidman barely shows up too long some goofiness that is hard to take seriously in a movie that wants oh so bad to be serious   never mind that the writers only read the cliff notes about vikings  i give it two stars because i am a sucker for a viking movie
Jan 29 2024,positive,like all of eggers films if you dont fully understand the lore youll likely be stuck at times although mostly good i think it may be eggers weakest film yet 
Jan 22 2024,positive,cinematography is crispy epic combined with crafty engaging storytelling now this is a fůcking viking movie folks skål
Jan 20 2024,positive,after being blown away by the vvitch and then seeing the masterpiece that is the lighthouse i knew that eggers had something special with the northman a fantastical epic about revenge and death this film is a visual marvel that hooked me instantly amazing performances interesting story and brutal fight scenes have me rating this one a 45 stars brilliant film
Jan 18 2024,negative,probably the worst movie i have seen in a long time weak plot and horrible acting even the special effects lame  dont waste your time on this disaster fooled by the high rotten tomatos rating dont believe it
Jan 16 2024,positive,prepare for a tale of vikings vengeance and the road to vallhalla when prince amleths father is murdered by his uncle he embarks on a quest of vengeance against the traitor who killed his father beautiful in its aesthetic and brutal in its violence eggars brings the world of norse mythology to life
Jan 13 2024,positive,absolutely gorgeous stunning on every way
Jan 12 2024,negative,i was thoroughly unimpressed
Jan 7 2024,negative,unbelievably bad dont waste your time 
Jan 3 2024,positive,movie was awesome if you liked conan the barbarian from the 80s with arnold then you will enjoy this the action is great and the mythos is excellent alexander is good in this movie along with the supporting cast it really made me feel like i was watching arnolds conan from the 80s worth watch for sure
Jan 2 2024,negative,great cast   movie  meh x 10
Jan 1 2024,positive,very likely the greatest viking movie that will ever be made exciting emotional authentic i am entertained with every repeat viewing
Dec 31 2023,negative,very long and mostly boring the northman tribal scene way too long and stretched out a lot of unnecessary filler and repeated dream scenes then the final fight on top of an active volcano where the sulfurous fumes and heat would kill any living thing but it these two they kill each other story line runs along most viking movies but movie did have hope of the didnt stretch it out so long 
Dec 30 2023,negative,i have no idea why this movie has high ratings  it is 95 generic filler from any generic vikings movie and the remaining 5 is a script that a 12 year old could have written  is it that anyone will watch  and fear to criticize  a movie with the massive clan of skarsgårds in it  any single episode of the vikings series is better than this waste of time
Dec 26 2023,negative,viking slasher kits how are vikings portrayed in this movie every second someone gets butchered by a brutal viking after 30 minutes we were laughing about the stupidity of it all the artificial kits acting and the butchering was getting really annoying and we were laughing because everything was so overdone
Dec 25 2023,negative,one of the worst movies i have watched bad story and bad acting
Dec 13 2023,positive,a beautiful film with brilliant protagonists and a well written plot the northman is a must watch for fans of norse mythology
Dec 12 2023,positive,good but not great there are some parts midway and at the end that just makes no sense at all really detracted from a solid movie overall i liked this movie
Dec 8 2023,positive,not as good as the directors the lighthouse but it does a great job of showing norse mythology and mysticism definitely one of the best film about vikings if not the best
Dec 6 2023,positive,great revenge movie looks beautiful as one has come to expect from a robert egger film acting is good score is superb it can drag at times but i wasnt able to take my eyes off the screen a true representation of viking life as you can get i presume anyone who is into norse mythology and all that stuff will enjoy this
Dec 1 2023,positive,great movie bit slow at times
Nov 30 2023,positive,well shot good characters decent score
Nov 16 2023,negative,i was pretty bored watching this yeah the action is cool and scenes felt epic but at the end of the day i didnt care and it wasnt memorable
Nov 12 2023,positive,a revenge movie that is violent brutal and bloody with a stunning cinematography this is probably one of my favorite movies of 2022
Nov 12 2023,negative,maybe not the worst movie ever made but with every minute that goes by one is convinced that its characters and director are desperately trying to reach that mark
Nov 11 2023,negative,disappointing a cinematic masterpiece authentic to the age  ultimately boring and will be forgotten in two minutes thanks to a lack of any real relationships between any characters whatsoever not one character with an actual personality  just some cardboard cut outs reciting overwrought lines in heavy accents for two hours mostly tedious
Nov 10 2023,negative,im really concerned that professional critics gave it a good review i have lost faith in rotten tomatoes   just a bad movie for every reason
Nov 6 2023,negative,not goodreally not good at all plot was subpar boring slow burn without the suspense depth or profundity which would be needed to make it interesting  making something slow doesnt make it more deep or meaningful in this case its an absolute snooze with no payoff   i rarely feel like i get nothing from a movie and that it was a complete waste of time but this was one of those cases
Nov 1 2023,negative,they should rename this movie to the southman for how quickly this movie went south     a glorified snoozer skarsgård has an absolute rig though
Oct 30 2023,negative,you can barely tell what the characters are saying the plot is all over the place and in the end the hero and villain dies would recommend to my worst enemy
Oct 6 2023,positive,a revenge movie is nothing new but this is something else brutal and bloody and at times beautiful this effort does comes as a sort of modern day shakespeare  one of 2022s best movies
Sep 28 2023,positive,i love this movie and i love this era
Sep 12 2023,negative,i watched this movie for anya taylor joy i did not care so much for the manly men doing manly stuff and making manly guttural noises it was alright
Sep 11 2023,positive,the northman was pretty solid
Sep 10 2023,negative,ive heard this is good so im quite looking forward to it but i have a suspicion i might just find it a bit tryhard in its authenticity    hmmm  having watched it im not sure quite what i thought of it  its diverting but takes itself a bit too seriously particularly considering how silly a lot of it is  its the ageold tale of someone done wrong and putting things right in a kinda questy way with stuff happening along the way  i have to say it didnt half go on 136 minutes  i was totally get a move on for a large chunk of this film and i suspected i knew exactly how it was going to end from the first minute and i wasnt far wrong  not that i really cared by that point    i didnt love this and i didnt hate it  but having finished it a lot of the comments i found id made whilst watching it were on the negative side  a lot of it is very dark  not in mood but in visibility which actually hasnt been a big problem this year so far  there are also a lot of silly accents involved some of which are more consistent than others and its surprisingly wordy for whats described as a brutal viking saga and it spends too much time using old norse or something subtitles  we all know thats what they spoke all the time so dont pretend they only did it when they were angry  there was also far far too much shouting at the sky going on and a silly number of heads being chopped off    it does however always look very good  its well filmed apparently robert eggers can be relied upon here but this is the first of his films ive seen  whilst it might have shared roots with hamlet but i was very much reminded of this version of macbeth  its not in black and white but it shares a lot of the same style when you can see whats going on  additionally the scenery is beautiful  i have a strong suspicion that iceland was heavily involved wikipedia tells me it was but most of it was actually filmed in northern ireland  i suspect the cast probably didnt overly enjoy the filming experience though   theres a lot of wandering about in the mud or the sea involved    and its got a very impressive cast indeed  theres a lot of wellknown names involved in this  possibly one might argue too many wellknown names without them necessarily knowing what to do with them  alexander skarsgard certainly isnt underused though  and he does a decent job but he was unlucky considering he has just come off playing matsson in succession and it does feel at times that this role is just a much earlier version of that here hes a viking disrupter  of the rest of the cast id say anja taylorjoy comes over the best for me  its also funny seeing klaes bang playing the prick but in viking times as opposed to more modern times  but when you look at some of the other names involved nicole kidman ethan hawke willem dafoe bjork and various other recognisable faces its hard not to feel they were a bit wasted    all of which sounds a bit negative about the film doesnt it  maybe im being harsh because it certainly looked good and it felt good  but when i actually thought about what it was doing it wasnt entirely clear what it contained  its also very hard to describe what genre it falls into  horror action thriller drama  it all felt a bit style over substance which didnt stand up to close inspection for me  maybe i just shouldnt have inspected it so closely   so if you want to watch it just try to do so without thinking about it too much and you can currently stream it on sky or rent it in any of the usual locations
Sep 9 2023,positive,i found it refreshingly different  if your looking for a epic like the show vikings nope this isnt a transgenerational saga like that  its a one mans journey of a spiritual reckoning n revenge only to find that he wasted his time seeking revenge when he could have had family n life  then again it wouldnt be able to draw on the theology and historical story that created the imagery n amleth path in the first place
Sep 2 2023,negative,hamlet with nordic names sprinkled in dont believe me amleth is just hamlet with the h moved to the end jester friends skull makes an appearance uncle kills dad and moms in on the whole affairyeah no one has peripheral vision and the plot holes could sink atlantis
Aug 31 2023,positive,the northman     this historical thriller sees the protagonistamleth a viking prince as he journeys to exert revenge on the man who usurped his fathers throne after killing him    the northman is visceral with a consistently grim tone    theres a lot to praise about the northman from the brilliant direction of robert eggers to the performances given by the cast the cinematography is also a marvel the world painted here is striking and enlivened with brute action and a killer score    the subject matter in the northman may be hackneyed and probably isnt driven by a lot of character development but as a whole it is an utter viking movie    7510
Aug 28 2023,negative,i just couldnt get into it  compared to game of thrones this movie was a neanderthal violent movie  kind of corny
Aug 27 2023,negative,absolutely horrible movie if you wish to waste any time watching it shame on you  i found out the hard way by watching this mess
Aug 27 2023,negative,absolute rubbish save yourself 2 hours and never turn it on could have been really good with the actors involved but is utter crap cant believe i stayed with it till the end thinking it may get better
Aug 25 2023,positive,great film the most historically accurate viking film yet 
Aug 25 2023,positive,those who have read norse mythology and epic tales of vikings will absolutely love this movie no soft shit just straight viking
Aug 24 2023,negative,god i couldnt take it after 30 minutes too pretentious and over the top theres no depth to the characters and the dialogues were lacking 25 hours of vikings preying howling and rage screaming cliche stuff
Aug 14 2023,negative,not the best story line unless you like stories to not pan out like you thought they would
Aug 13 2023,negative,slow start  the story line is laughable and unrealistic  he goes his entire life waiting for the opportunity to avenge his father  free his mother by killing his uncle yet he disappoints at every opportune time  just no
Aug 12 2023,positive,the part i read before posting has to do with your mindest  to be honest this is a great revenge tale movie  the gore and sex doesnt in my mind detract from what could be called the john wick of the nordic realm
Aug 7 2023,positive,an original and engrossing take on the revenge tale that does not follow common cinematic tropes well executed and structured with an amazing score and breathtakingly shot this film has some quirks and some oddities woven in but what is on display is original and very engaging and enticing great twists in the narrative and a satisfying climax the acting and accents engross you in the scandinavianviking life and the scenery especially in iceland is incredibly captivating some of the long tracking and action sequences are equally impressive some of the visual effects and action sequences were lacking though but this did not diminish how the film lands overall    setting conflict character dialogue theme plot and climax a    audience engagement do you feel runtime no    top genres  action adventure drama fiction    runtime  217    genres rating action  7 adventure  8 drama  7 fantasy  8 history  7 thriller  7    genre average score 73 directing 8 cinematographylighting 9 storynarrative 8 structure 9 dialogue 9 scoremusic 10 editing 8 acting 8 characterization 9 mise en scènevisual design 9 visual effects 7 costumesmakeup 8 lasting impact 8 originality 10    overall 849 425 rt
Aug 5 2023,positive,fantastic film it deserves so much more praise more films like this should be made nowadays
Aug 5 2023,negative,poor scripting bad visual effects and a surprisingly bad performance from hawke make this cheap viking movie more of a knockoff than a knockout
Jul 30 2023,positive,amazing better with each watch 
Jul 29 2023,negative,lacks originality for all the uncle killing the king and the son coming back to avenge the father plots we have seenyou would think they couldve  done better besides the obviousavenge my father themethe story sucks does someone actually watch this at the end and think oh this is great impossible
Jul 28 2023,positive,i was looking forward to watching this but ended up being disappointed this wouldve been way better as a limited series or something with certain events in the beginning happening so fast to set the stage for vengeance it just didnt give time for one to feel any meaningful emotion towards really craving justice and this film clearly wants you to crave it in a special way with how the main character is the fighting regarding the main character didnt have much impact like it should either in my opinion theres plenty of movies out there where the hero is fighting and you find yourself tensed up or squeezing your leg without knowing it at first i didnt get that with this movie which made it awkward because i wanted to sure theres blood and gore but i think it was an issue with the fighting choreographer or lackluster stunt actors spoilers ahead and my biggest gripe was after all the stuff the main character went through to get his strength built up the rage the drive the weird magic he took part in and everything elseall of that to end with him having a fatal draw at the end against a dude who wasnt even in his prime anymore and kinda overpowered him most of the fight it just felt like a major letdown with hardly any satisfaction
Jul 28 2023,negative,this was your typical sundance type of film usually if it has that label its going to be horrible angles terrible story the idea of the plot is good but overall the details in between and how to get there terrible the only good part of this movie is him adopting the mantra he had of saving his mother and avenging his father made for some badass moments but overall just a horrendous movie in every way possible
Jul 27 2023,negative,woof wouldnt waste over two hours watching this hard to follow baseless story line the fantasy aspect makes this movie a reach and takes away from what the story could have been half a star is generous
Jul 21 2023,positive,yes this is viking hamlet  yes its awesome  a few of the artistic choices of the director will turn some people off to it but i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and loved how practical the sets and stunts were  i highly recommend this underrated movie and wish there were more like it
Jul 16 2023,positive,really like shakespeare and i have always been fascinated by the ancient vikings well the northman is a viking version of shakespeares hamlet a very dark version and of course vikings will be vikings so this is a very violent and very bloody movie on a grand cinematic scale  young prince amleth is about to become a man when his father king aurvandilis ethan hawke is brutally murdered in front him by his uncle fjolnir claes bang fjolnir then kidnaps his mother takes over the kingdom and sends assassins to kill amleth  amleth must flee his home his land and his mother he barely escapes and he swears vengeance on fjolnir and everyone that has wronged him and his family  i will avenge you father i will save you mother i will kill you fjolnir   amleth  amleth begins a bloody hatedriven quest to kill his uncle fjolnir he embraces hate and anger evil and vengeance so much so that his vision becomes blurred he is obsessed with hate for his uncle and killing him and everyone that stands in his way  i am amleth the bearwolf son of king aurvandill the war raven and i am his vengeance  amleth  this movie holds nothing back it is visually detailed in a brutally violent bloody mess and the film is almost unapologetic about it in a viking sort of way i mean it is vikings that is what vikings do  the movie is just beautifully shot and the actors are just amazing nicole kidman alexander skarsgård ethan hawke william dafoe björk anya taylorjoy  if you like shakespeares hamlet and you do not mind all the blood and violence you will like the northman but even if you dont know the story of hamlet it is a really good viking movie
Jul 15 2023,neutral,a very grounded and realistic take on vikings and north mythology the music is a real standout in the film and so is the acting from alexander skarsgård and anya taylorjoy but i would also say that this film was a bit of a drag with its run time
Jul 10 2023,positive,a compelling and frequently brutal insight into the lives and spiritual beliefs of early medieval northwestern ie germanic europeans the cinematography is outstanding and the acting is excellent the story may feel familiar  its drawn from the same folk history as is hamlet and the director was inspired by 80s cult masterpiece conan the barbarian  but the telling is masterful
Jul 9 2023,neutral,the beginning sets up an emotional struggle that promises to be an interesting premise but ultimately falls under its own weight especially towards the end
Jul 3 2023,positive,artsy war film people are going to go into this film thinking its gladiator its not great cinematography and acting but it is slow at times with some action scenes i really enjoyed it but it may be too artsy for some
Jul 1 2023,positive,a little slow in the middle but good story and more original than i expected  nice twist
Jun 24 2023,positive,the northman transports us to a world both ancient and timeless where dark tales of honor and revenge unfold against a backdrop of aweinspiring landscapes and evocative atmospheres from the first frame to the last eggers directorial prowess is evident as he flawlessly weaves together a complex tapestry of emotions stunning visuals and captivating storytelling
Jun 18 2023,negative,awful who fights naked with swords next to molten lava  goes totally unscathed from the volcanic heat its laughable
Jun 18 2023,positive,a visionary mesmerizing film breathtaking shots combined with a manic attention to detail typical of the director where no historical detail has been overlooked intriguing epic and profound 1010
Jun 15 2023,positive,if you are a fan of robert eggers you already know his films either make you think the characters are on drugs or you are in this film he removes that wonder its the characters this is an epic revenge movie with plenty of action along side some trippy ass moments eggers takes a step away from horror to make what feels like an accurate portrayal of what life was like during the time of vikings    this movie didnt hit me until the following day i wait a day to review any movie i watch as it is but this one in particular settled in my soul while i slept its a dark and twisted ride that needed to marinate dont go into this film thinking you are going to watch a text book style period piece go into this film with an open mind or better yet a sedated one
Jun 13 2023,positive,badass movie one of the very few movies that i actually bough on dvd 1010 recommend
Jun 10 2023,positive,i will never forgive the world for allowing this film to flop the northman is a great film full of great action history and it is a great display of the artistry that film should this film has something to say and we should all listen the actors are well directed and clearly gave their all my only complaint is that willem dafoe did not have more screen time
Jun 7 2023,positive,enjoyable mostly artistic i suppose really violent looks good in uhd on oled
Jun 4 2023,positive,theres some really rough parts to watch for more sensitive audiences this one pulls no punches but the acting is compelling the cinematography and symbolism are exquisite and the ending fits the tone of the rest of the films story    some bits were a little overdrawn avenge save kill didnt need to be repeated a dozen times for us to get the point  i had to question what i just watched but not in an offended or horrified way  overall worth a sit
Jun 3 2023,positive,6710  decentworth watching    seen on 6223
May 31 2023,negative,the worst movie i seen in a long time i watched on advice of criticsterrible dont waste your time  painful
May 23 2023,positive,this is a 5 star movie no doubt  what a production great cast great direction and a very interesting way to tell this tale
May 21 2023,positive,good movie bloody violent trippy i really enjoyed the use of magic or mythology to aid in the story went in with no expectations and feel very satisfied with the outcome
May 19 2023,positive,wow that was brutal but entertaining with a great twist at the end
May 19 2023,negative,ive been watching a lot of viking era tv shows and movies lately the northman just didnt hit the spot for me that i wanted it to the story was just too confusing for casual watching
May 19 2023,negative,good photography the rest is so boring
May 14 2023,neutral,the very end sword battle confirmed my opinion of a movie with some good moments and some moments of too much of a hollywood touch
May 13 2023,positive,interesting movie but tried too hard to air a statement   sometime less is more   def watchable and good production lots of thought and build well i feel apocalypto did it better though
May 13 2023,positive,really good film i was expecting more action from the film but that was on me being assumptive not the film   for what it is and what they are trying to do its a fantastic film with a mixture of reality and what can be dream scenes which i suppose are to be interpreted as either a hallucinations or real mythological happenings  i like that it is not explained as it does incentivise rewatching the film
May 4 2023,positive,i checked this out in a movie trailer before i saw the movie i came for and it looked very interesting i heard good reviews for it but i never thought much about it one boring night and after seeing a movie with anya taylor joy i decided to finally check this out     set during the time of the vikings amleth son of king aurvandill narrowly escapes his life after his wicked uncle fjlonir murders and claims the throne having grown to manhood and ferocious as a warrior in his own right chooses to return as a slave to avenge his father the king with the help of a russian slave witch and his experiences with fighting and with advice of witches and wizards he finally gets a chance to fulfill his promise to avenge his father and so much more    i saw this trailer but nothing prepared me for how good this was it was like a nordic version of conan the barbarian with phenomenal storytelling acting sets costumes etc alexander skarsgard was great masculine and powerful presence anya taylor joy was mesmerizing both physically and charismatic the other actors nicole kidman ethan hawke willem dafoe were also splendid this was a great movie
Apr 30 2023,positive,anya taylor joy carried
Apr 26 2023,negative,this is a very slow boring film the casting outside of the lead didnt work and the plot was awful
Apr 24 2023,positive,eggers is the new aronosky which means you either hate or love this film i liked it
Apr 22 2023,positive,authentic well acted attention grabbing
Apr 20 2023,positive,after a couple of excellent lowbudget movies the witch the lighthouse director robert eggers tackles bigbudget action in the northman and while its not a bad film by any stretch of the imagination it certainly proves that big is not always better  set in the late 10th century it is a bloody tale of revenge as amleth alexander skarsgard sets out on the singleminded task of avenging the murder of his father  while it has many of the attributes of its predecessors including clever camerawork interesting lighting excellent period details dark themes and fascinating locations it does feel as though it drags at times thanks primarily to its obsessive fascination with the mythology of the time and the associated rituals  the northman feels like a really good movie that should have been great but got bogged down in the details
Apr 16 2023,negative,has been actors trying to stay relevant no depth bad acting no real storyline  cinematography bad
Apr 15 2023,negative,highly watchable but deeply flawed  characters do some really stupid things to keep the story moving along  after robert eggers fascinating the vvitch and visceral the lighthouse i expected a much smarter script    the northman is full of why would they do that moments  the plot devices are so bloated all the seams in this movie are showing  this makes it hard to suspend disbelief and fully enjoy the spectacle
Apr 10 2023,positive,great scandi style take on the legendary story
Apr 10 2023,negative,boring thin storyline painfully long
Apr 5 2023,positive,this movie is overrated by critics and its not that good i liked the violent revenge part of this movie too
Apr 5 2023,positive,there are some good things and some bad things about the northman on the plus side writerdirector robert eggers who started out as a production designer has devoted great care in recreating a tawdry 10th century viking world full of muck and violence where kings can wind up sheep herders in a very barrenlooking iceland he shows that vikings did a large trade in slaves they captured from mostly slavic areas from which derives the word slave and that their religious rites included using hallucinogens to attain vision experiences his recreation of the way viking warriors worked themselves into the berserk state of a wild beast before battle is a bit less convincing  their clumsy movements look too much like the wild things rumpus dance but the bad things are in the plot loosely drawn from the scandinavian legend of prince amleth who sought revenge for his uncles murdering his father and marrying his mother  the source for shakespeares hamlet we see everything through amleths eyes first as a young prince who worships his soontobemurdered father then jumping twenty years later to see him as an apparently invincible viking warrior who hates his life of raiding and pillaging when he learns his murderous uncle is now in exile in iceland he kicks into revenge mode and disguises himself as a slave to get to him amleth is curiously singleminded for a 30something viking warrior with a princes education who by now would have traveled far and wide pillaging and trading with all sorts of cultures and seen the many shades of gray between good and evil would he really be so driven by revenge at this point in his life further for the part of amleth produceractor alexander skarsgård has gotten himself physically pumped up into a cartoon parody of the actual rawboned vikings who didnt have access to good nutrition workout rooms and personal trainers skarsgård is trapped by his twodimensional characters revenge fixation which prevents him from doing much real acting at least there is anya taylorjoy as fellow slave olga of the birch forest a slavic witch who is much better connected with the earths mysteries and far more cunning than amleth early on amleth was advised by his father never seek the secrets of women but heed them always and it is his failure to heed women that leads to the films disappointing ending after his mother brags to him how she betrayed both his father and him to be murdered by his uncle amleth escapes with olga who is already carrying his twin children but then stupidly decides that he must take out his remaining kin to protect his new family since there is no real kingdom at stake any more what exactly is the point action film protocol demands a final showdown battle however so we get yet another overblown fight scene with lots of testosteronedriven bellowing and despite wielding the magical sword draugr amleth of course must die too like hamlet
Apr 1 2023,negative,im shocked about the good reviews its probably just me then who thought that the acting was horrendous even from nicole kidman and i actually love her i tried to see the movie as a comedy to survive it  i would have switched it off after 5 mins but it was a movie night    ps i didnt think botox and braces were already a thing back then
Mar 31 2023,positive,an artistic combination of history mythology religion and setting to show what viking life may have looked like
Mar 30 2023,neutral,with all the good things i heard i thought this was going to be mindblowing but it turned out to be movie with some of the most simplistic and base storytelling there is     the cast does well the visuals are great but the movie just feels boring there are action scenes to keep you thrilled but they are few and far between does it make it more realistic yes but its not anything super enthralling
Mar 27 2023,positive,entertaining movie unusual but interesting flow
Mar 25 2023,positive,a great movie probably not for everyone
Mar 24 2023,positive,atmospheric brutal cinematic    art house conan     wonderful
Mar 22 2023,positive,people giving this film bad reviews are the reasons why we keep getting these shitty franchise movies that are just there to make money
Mar 20 2023,positive,not as good as i had hoped for but still overall a good movie characters were all cast and done well with the one exception of the main characters mother terrible character
Mar 19 2023,negative,one of the worst movies ive seen in a long time big fan of all the viking era shows and this did nothing for me painful to watch
Mar 19 2023,positive,best movie experience i had in 2022  unforgiving and uncompromising in its scope historical and mythological accuracy and brutality  this film longs for the age of historical epic films to return  it definitely wont be for everyone especially due to its methodical pacing and morally grey characters but i have no complaints
Mar 19 2023,negative,too many spectaclesromanticism about simple revenge and not much contentplot
Mar 12 2023,positive,i loved it  i am a huge reader of historical fiction on the vikings era  and i love norse mythology i thought it was well done captured the mysticism and lots of  good bloody battles my wifes name is olga so that was fulfilling as well
Mar 10 2023,positive,robert eggers is truly something special the northman is simply badass great redemption story with amazing action and plot some of the weird stuff that vikings used to do might be weird to some but the film is still great and has passion to back it up
Mar 8 2023,positive,it just gets better every time you rewatch it and boy have i rewatched it
Mar 8 2023,positive,an epic and mysterious tale with grand scenery and intense atmosphere    this is not a dumb straightforward action movie if you are looking for that this is not for you    the northman is a grand tale of revenge in a world of authentic nordic myth it is a brutal and dirty world filled with believable rituals and epic pictures of earth sky and fire its magnificent cinematography elevates it to the next level it is well crafted on every level well acted and perfectly executed    a shakespearean tale of revenge that shakes off the clean washed disney look that has dominated the movies in recent years for a more essential movie experience it is a brutal nordic grownup more interesting less mainstream version of gladiator so if you are into movies really into movies not just the alwayssame blockbusters you will enjoy it
Mar 7 2023,positive,it was ok  worth a watch but nothing mind blowing some decent action
Mar 7 2023,negative,painfully slow and stylized
Mar 6 2023,negative,i really wanted to like it but i thought it was awful i love viking based movies and shows but this was  painful to go through it has really great actors but even they couldnt save it  i can do artsy movies but this was just bad
Mar 1 2023,neutral,its awful  hate the english
Feb 26 2023,positive,slow pace tragedy in a sad story about vengeance and destiny nice cinematography good acting kidman good as always maybe a bit too long or too slow pace in some scenes
Feb 25 2023,negative,how did this rate 90 with critics as of feb 2023  the awful accents are still stuck in my head prolonging the misery resulting from the basic and silly story weird effects slow pace and predictability  couldnt wait for it to end yet held on to hope it might improve  nothing satisfying occurred it just got worse as time went on
Feb 24 2023,positive,possibly the best movie i saw in 2022 a massively enjoyable meditation on revenge think of it as hamlet but with battle axes and disembowelment alexander skarsgard  is his usual beautiful enigmatic self and nicole kidman despite the uncanny valley effect of all of her cosmetic surgery gives a performance that should have been more celebrated by the awards folks robert eggers will likely never be given a budget this big again but he put every penny on the screen gorgeous aweinspiring brilliant work
Feb 23 2023,neutral,oh man and i was looking forward to this one   coming from the director of the witch i expected something different this felt less historically authentic than what i was hoping for inspired by legend of amleth which in turn inspired hamlet this felt more like an onlocation stageplay of hamlet than an actual take on the norse people     lately there has been a fascination with nordic or spartan mythology and likewise the interpretations have been less about authentic reality and more on manly mythical creative license emphasis on the toxic masculinity because of this i tend to roll my eyes at these interpretations many times they get passed off as authentic when if fact most takes are more for style rather than substance now i could get into the nittygritty about why i hate these takes on the norse culture and i feel i might be a bit too harsh but i simply dont have enough time     coming from a director that so expertly blended the authentic with the desolate and even the human condition to mythologize everything this simply didnt sit right with me
Feb 22 2023,positive,this movie is my kind of movie its a dark revenge adventure story with fantastical elements and i loved it this is also the first robert eggers movie that i have seen and will definitely check out his other ones the lighthousethe witch this movie isnt for everyone due to the intense gore and already told story but im willing to give this movie a pass because of how old the story is that the movie is based off of 1010 wouldnt change a thing about it
Feb 20 2023,negative,so awful that i thought it was a joke
Feb 19 2023,positive,expected more from this movie the casting was great but the story is very boring
Feb 16 2023,positive,robert eggers hits the ball out of the park again with an epic tale of revenge that will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish
Feb 15 2023,positive,awesome movie loved the story the action and the cast missed the boat on seeing it in theaters but if you have the opportunity to watch i think it is a compelling story with great acting by all
Feb 15 2023,negative,2 hours and 15 minutes of my life ill never get back great cast but terrible script lowand i mean low budget fighting scenes and just terrible acting feels like everyone read the script minutes before shooting ah manthis movie sucks
Feb 14 2023,positive,robert eggers directs alexander skarsgård anya taylorjoy and many more in his latest feature film the northman tells a brutal story of betrayal and revenge fuelled by graphic imagery and immersive cinematography like his previous projects eggers doesnt skimp on the gore with the northman depicting grisly deaths and gruesome mutilations all throughout the 140minute runtime eggers reunites with many of his past associates for the film including editor louise ford production designer craig lathrop and costume designer linda muir to name a few    alexander skarsgård stars as amleth a prince on the cusp of becoming a man who after a brutal ambush witnesses his fathers ethan hawke death at the hands of his uncle claes bang two decades later and now a viking on a mission to avenge his father amleth meets olga anya taylorjoy a headstrong woman who aides amleth in the completion of his quest as the opportunity for revenge grows closer will amleth succeed in his bloody crusade or will he fall before his uncles blade    eggers reunites with the lighthouse and the witch cinematographer jarin blaschke to create the northmans bewitching cinematography littering the film with smooth lengthy takes and making effective use of the natural light available to them blaschkes visuals serve as the perfect way to show off the films intricate production design courtesy of craig lathrop whos recent projects include antonio campos the devil all the time and eggers previous film the lighthouse  lathrops work is just one of the many ways the film immerses you into 10th century iceland much like eggers previous work the northman is not only an entertaining film but is a feast for the eyes with intricate details seen all over the screen    headlined by a marvellous turn from alexander skarsgård the northman features strong performances from its entire starstudded cast nicole kidman anya taylorjoy and claes bang each given thrilling performances with the criminally underused willem dafoe and ethan hawke also each giving remarkable turns though kidmans best moment comes when she delivers a twisted venomlaced monologue to her son skarsgård that turns his world upside down the northman once again shows that robert eggers doesnt skimp on heavy gore or nudity in his films and isnt afraid to let his films be ugly and gruesome louise fords editing makes sure to show off the films intense violence and deaths including an unbroken scene where a character has his nose completely sliced off nude fights and reanimated corpses the northman is a film that does a remarkable job of keeping you on the edge of your seat throughout the entirety of the film effectively walking the line between nail biting action and intense drama encircled in a gritty tale of revenge    not only does robert eggers deliver yet another technical masterclass but the revered director also delivers a film with a vicious meaty story that you can easily sink your teeth into brilliantly drawn together with an unexpected ending perhaps one of the most artistic revenge thrillers to come in recent years the northman is an epicsized bloody affair driven by its powerful performances and impressive technical aspects the film leaves you anticipating robert eggers next outing in the directors chair which based on recent interviews may involve eggers bringing a story set in the elizabethan era to the big screen
Feb 12 2023,negative,alot of pointless trying to be artsy stuff thrown in that literally took the story away and made it boring
Feb 12 2023,negative,just dont watch it and save 2 hours of your life
Feb 11 2023,negative,quite possibly the worst acting i have ever seen in a movie
Feb 11 2023,positive,as the northman 2022 release 137 min opens we are in the north atlantic ad 895 when an expedition led by the king comes home to the delight of the queen and the young prince the king leads the prince into a ritual to become a man then one day the king and the prince are ambushed and the king is killed by his jealous brother at this point we are 10 minutes into the movie    couple of comments this is the latest from writerproducerdirector robert eggers the witch the lighthouse here he brings the tale of a viking whose father the king is killed and the viking is bent on revenge no matter what to cost or how long it takes lets state the obvious the movies storyline and everything else is about as subtle as a bull in a china shop there isnt a single moment in the film that i thought oh wow this is unexpected that aside the production with ireland standing in for viking land is top notch as are the lead performances none more so than alexander skarsgard as the revengeseeking viking this is by no means a bad movie but neither is it an outstanding movie for that it is way too predictable and straightforward    the northman was released in us theaters this past spring to very disappointing box office numbers it then went to vod and now is streaming on amazon prime where i caught it this might be the type of movie that benefits from being seen on a large screen rather than at home if you are in the mood for a brutal viking revenge drama that is about as subtle as a bull in a china shop id readily suggest you check this out and draw your own conclusion
Feb 6 2023,negative,i wish we focused less on the abs of the main actor and made more meaningful stories
Feb 6 2023,positive,an actual good movie the plot is tried and youve seen it before but the same can be said of any movie all stories have been told before so what matters is execution     its a beautiful looking movie thats well acted well written and well directed if violent movies dont appeal to you then this is probably not going to be your thing anymore than musicals are to me so i dont watch and rate them
Feb 2 2023,positive,its a lot of nonsense but fun to watch  moody ethereal striking scenery and technically flawless in terms of cinematography and special effects  story is goofy mythology supernatural events mixed with blood soaked fighting and battles swords everywhere chopping off heads and emptying guts etc  not as heavy and intellectually meaningful as perhaps eggers and cowriter sjon intend  it only succeeds in evincing human rage and revenge and leans very heavily on mystical nordicviking religiosity which is not that meaningful to a modern audience  even with all that it is very visually well made film with great performances and quite entertaining  it is obscure and hard to follow the dialogue and plot at times but i felt like it had something to offer i might have missed so i watched it twice and liked it a lot better the second time
Feb 1 2023,positive,entertaining but not great
Jan 27 2023,negative,was hoping for more from this movie
Jan 25 2023,positive,this movie is a historical drama masterpiece    finally a director who cares about authentic portrayal of the period the story was simple yet brilliant and reminded me of icelandic sagas the third act was a little bit drawn out and could have been shorter but all in all it was perfect
Jan 25 2023,negative,the quality of this movie is a straight up affront to the 137minutes of my life that i spent watching it    its cliched forced and lacks a noteworthy character or storyline thats worth the while an annoying pile of mess no less    unbelievable
Jan 25 2023,neutral,like a good viking flick pass on this movie its not that beautifully shot with some good performances from the leads but suffers from a terminally pointless plot and just overloaded with weird supernatural nonsense pretty much a waste of some incredibly charismatic actors some good moments but an amazing opportunity wasted
Jan 24 2023,negative,generally disappointed  expected an epic saga but it was a long relentlessly hideous and bloody bummer of a film
Jan 23 2023,negative,awful terrible stiff dialogue terrible direction great art direction and great costumes though a ripoff from hamlet the director couldnt decide whether he wanted to keep it realistic or make it sounds shakespearean pure glorification of violence and macho culture the whole movie is an excuse to show two hot guys fighting naked in a volcano i wasted two hours of my life
Jan 23 2023,positive,a very interesting take on hamlet i throughly enjoyed the sets and costumes and the extremely accurate depiction of the viking world
Jan 22 2023,negative,this was one of the worst films i have ever tried to watch  do yourself a favor and pass on it
Jan 22 2023,negative,it just didnt do it for me i found the plot too simple in its core but full of meaningless and disjointed and the acting an impressive cast a little bit over the fence like they were trying too hard to sell it
Jan 22 2023,negative,everything in the trailer made me want to watch this its a long winded film with not a lot happening i dont blame the actors but its tragically dull its not suspenseful or clever ive seen worse but
Jan 21 2023,negative,frankly boring  irritatingly bad despite all the emperors new clothes metal viking extreme hype  star power   there were walk outs from the big screen at our viewing  i joined them  its really that bad
Jan 19 2023,neutral,it was sorta ok but nothing spectacular  if you have nothing else to watch its worth a watch as one of the last things to watch on your list
Jan 18 2023,positive,it sucked wheres thor   this film is what films used to be an actual movie a very familiar story outstanding look for a modern release it has tone it has tone
Jan 18 2023,negative,i expected so much more from this movie a star studded cast couldnt save this script
Jan 18 2023,positive,beautifully executed film the score was perfect the casting spectacular perfect
Jan 16 2023,positive,this is a masterful and original presentation of shakespeares hamlet i watched it twice and the second time it came to me that this was viking hamlet fantastic so wonderful to see this done with complete respect and the power of viking culture meshed with elizabethan era elsinore plus alexander skarsgards acting not to mention his magnificent body ahem is really awe inspiring mr skarsgard you are better than olivier the best hamlet i ever saw so there
Jan 16 2023,positive,a brutally bleak period drama based on revenge most of the movie took place in one area which wadnt what i was expecting some good moments some cliches i didnt like such as why doesnt the bad guy just kill him at the end when he has the chance he was basically asking for to be killed very bleak ending everyone dies so dark i felt like crap after watching that ngl dont like movies that bleak generally my rating could move up with time queens gambit still my favorite eggers work so far
Jan 16 2023,negative,this felt like they gave a movie budget and amazing actors to a director making a college art video the movie is has long winded scenes one dimensional characters and a shallow plot want a movie about vikings look elsewhere
Jan 16 2023,positive,the best viking movie i have ever seen
Jan 16 2023,neutral,meh it passed the time
Jan 15 2023,negative,boring story sounded promising but it didnt deliver some films are good enough to watch again this one is barely worth watching the first time round
Jan 15 2023,positive,best viking movie made in the longest time 
Jan 15 2023,negative,bad storyline bad dialogue unnecessary scene oh what a bad movie
Jan 13 2023,positive,love it     one of the best films in a long time it takes you back in time
Jan 13 2023,negative,how why this was a poor movie all around and i love odd plots and storyline twists im also a fan of gore and blood the casting was unbelievable except for bjork the only thing that kept me watching was what the lighting was doing on kidmans face
Jan 12 2023,negative,what a disappointing movie  once again a production company releases trailers that dont depict at all what the movie is going to be like  this thing zapped the interest out of me with its long winded scenes  could have been one of the best pictures of the year  some questionable casting as well
Jan 12 2023,positive,this movie has some really good cinematography the movies plot was definitely not what i thought it would benot necessarily a good way or bad 710
Jan 12 2023,negative,absolutely awful  like bad bad
Jan 12 2023,negative,weak plot awful character development corny special effects gratuitous barking and groaning make it stop
Jan 11 2023,positive,a little too much actually but wonderful atmosphere and visuals
Jan 11 2023,negative,terrible movie what nonsense
Jan 11 2023,negative,i was hoping for another awesome viking series could not stand the style nor the music this director uses i could not even sit through half an hour of it messed up ritual with father and son count me out just weird
Jan 10 2023,positive,its an awesome movie really god action and camera
Jan 10 2023,positive,very solid movie nothing unique or special yet all aspects the movie attempted are well done contrast and symbolization are well done violent but charming and beatiful
Jan 10 2023,positive,absolutely mind blowing historically accurate no half measures badass film everybody played authentic chilling atmosphere and music great shots and simple yet already perfect dialogs and plot we need to give more money to director brilliant man
Jan 9 2023,positive,this one is worthy of the title epos the landscapes in which the story unfolds are cold inhospitable and barren like the characters that cling to animalism and wargod beliefs i would classify the feel somewhere inbetween gladiator the 13th warrior and the fellowship of the ring and despite it feeling somehow modern and a little bit too stylish i am convinced that the producers tried to put emphasis on historical aspects and daily life routines
Jan 9 2023,positive,my favorite movie of 2022 phenomenal adaption of the tale that inspired william shakespears hamlet
Jan 8 2023,positive,interesting and fast moving  weaves the mythical aspects in a way that isnt heavy handed and comic booky way  even the excessive violence feels appropriate in a way that might seem exploitive in other films i dont normally like this type of movie but this film captured me the whole way
Jan 8 2023,positive,i enjoyed it i consider this to be better than the witch and much better than the lighthouse i dont have any specific complaints i was kinda expecting it to be another gladiator so i am a bit lukewarm after having seen it
Jan 7 2023,negative,authentic cerebral but slow and boring at times
Jan 7 2023,negative,i watched it for about 10 minutes enough were all the movie critics on lsd when they made their reviews how low can you go
Jan 7 2023,positive,can be slow in parts but great watch
Jan 6 2023,negative,it was like a teenager was given a big budget to make a viking movie  take some beautiful scenery a few wellknown actors and half decent story and youve got the makings of a pretty good movie unfortunately the execution fell flat lots of random drawnout scenes which seemed to make no sense at all i made it all the way to the end hoping it would get better but i was horribly disappointed
Jan 6 2023,positive,really wanted to love it love the actors in it love the viking concept it just wasnt a very good story the writing just wasnt there with the actors they had this movie could have been epic smh
Jan 5 2023,negative,terrible worst movie ive seen in years the dialogue would have been funny if this was a spoof of viking movies strong cast with very bad script
Jan 4 2023,positive,im descended from vikings rollo to be exact went into this movie with no expectations but then came out really enjoying it gave me a lot to think about thought alexander skarsgard was great as the northman gave at times a subtle to an inyourface performance filmed in northern ireland ireland and icelandthe scenery is stunning all of the performances were excellent
Jan 4 2023,negative,i cant believe ive just watched what people here have already reviewed  the fight scenes are really bad the acting is average and the only plot twist is banal  so many holes im not sure where id start  it feels like a really bad viking copy of gladiator
Jan 4 2023,positive,i just cycled 44 kilometers to see this movie and it was every kilometer worth it the cinematography is after the batman the best of the year so far its gorgeous the acting is magnificent from everyone the directing by robert eggers is so good and the sound design and editing is insane the only thing is that i didnt always knew was what the rituals meant so it was kinda weird then the violence in this movie man some people in my theatre were definitely not prepared for it and there were only 8 people including me this movie was an awesome artistic movie  there are quite some shakespeare references i think in this movie for example the iconic sword death in macbeth when the king is sleeping and macbeth kills him kinda cool to see
Jan 4 2023,positive,eggers has the beginnings of a reputation for authentic period dialogue this one doesnt land for me though it aint hamlet especially the opening scenes struck me as hokey but a good cast saves it from being completely laughable    i dont know the legend being depicted so i cant speak to its quality as a treatment of that a bit on the gratuitous side    eggers primarily a production designer creates strong visuals with only a few moments of weak cg detracting
Jan 3 2023,positive,visually great story is fine conclusion is meh
Jan 3 2023,positive,pretty good original in its own ways but basically hamlet and the lion king story line acting is good and the cinematography is outstanding and its pretty entertaining only thing that i could think of that could be a problem was the pacing and maybe the music
Jan 3 2023,positive,beautifully shot acted and written i loved every minute of this the action scenes were spectacular
Jan 3 2023,negative,this movie was trying way too hard the accents were ridiculous stop rolling your rs so hard queens gambit the main character was underwhelming though it was no fault of the actor cinematography was excellent story was drawn out and unimaginative would not recommend 
Jan 3 2023,positive,if you liked conan the barbarian movies then this is for you
Jan 3 2023,negative,booooring one character reminded me of lord farquaad from shrek go watch that instead
Jan 3 2023,positive,i generally hate movies from this director so i was surprised by how much i enjoyed this film i also think its kinda underrated lowkey
Jan 3 2023,positive,eggers you did it this movie is amazing dare i say better than the lighthouse if rpatts had a starring role as well this would be my number one movie of 2022 so far the visuals are stunning the landscapes breathtaking it made me want to rewatch lamb the cast was wonderful as well my only wish is for a touch more chemistry between scarsgärd and taylor joy but we cant have it all keep up the good work eggers
Jan 2 2023,positive,objectively this movie had some flaws and parts of it seemed either rushed or cut but nothing that took me out of it in the moment i am rating on how much i enjoyed this movie it is super unfortunate that it didnt do well in theatres robert eggers is brimming with talent and i would love to see him succeed continuously his attention to detail really shines in this film and the acting is top notch  definitely the best viking movie that has ever been made
Jan 2 2023,negative,it wasnt what i expected i thought it was slow and a bit trippy at times
Jan 2 2023,positive,another great movie by eggers suitable for many audiences more so than his previous films captivating cinematography score and plot it feels authentic to the time period and has you on the edge of your seat 910
Jan 2 2023,positive,overall very good but i thought the ending sucked
Jan 2 2023,positive,not bad just not what i was expecting a slow burner with some action
Jan 1 2023,positive,i just watched it and id give it an 810 eggers is one of the most talented directors of the young generation the acting is at a very high level the set design the costumes are perfect the film keeps you in suspense until the last minute however the level of brutality in the first 40 minutes will not appeal to everyone this is not a subtle film we are dealing with the uncompromising nature of the main character whose driving force is obsessive revenge and animal fury many references in the main characters visions to norse mythology such as valhalla valkyrie yggdrassil tree
Jan 1 2023,positive,overall robert eggers has delivered another stunning film  this film is loaded with beautiful visuals including dream sequences and beautiful landscapes  the film itself is dark violent gritty and brutal and i was highly entertained for the entire duration even if some moments flew over my mind at first  aspects relating to the plot are a little predictable but i still smiled watching everything unfold from start to finish  performances are tremendous and cant be faulted  this feature wont be for everyone especially given the many disturbing unsettling moments  those familiar with the directors craft and skill will know what to expect and here the director is playing with a bigger budget than fans have experienced previously  i found myself admiring this film visually and its story had me by the veins its a wonderful and memorable achievement for cinema
Dec 31 2022,positive,an artistic take on a bare bones classic revenge story an incredibly well researched love letter to scandinavian mythology a violent journey into a brutal world a triumph
Dec 31 2022,positive,saw this at the theatre and really enjoyed it nothing better than a good revenge story worth seeing
Dec 31 2022,neutral,hamlet meets conan in a time of norse barbarism good acting great action but somehow it doesnt click some plot devices felt disjointed and the end was a bit meh didnt feel invested in any of the characters particularly
Dec 31 2022,positive,a movie that respects its concept it has the magic that the old movies had if some people say its nothing new and we have seen this many times before dont listen to them after all a team that wins doesnt need change anyway for me its 1010
Dec 31 2022,negative,an idiot with idiotic life goals does idiotic things the movie looks great why is everyone rolling their rs so much sounds like a bunch of people imitating cats r something effects were a bit off especially nicole kidmans face
Dec 30 2022,positive,cannot understand how people hate on this movie its a movie taking me back to the glory days of film by a million miles better than any other story today i take it that the people hating on the movie is the same people loving rings of power
Dec 30 2022,positive,captivating with stunning cinematography highly recommend a few abstract scenes but found them interesting my 13 yr old son watched the entire movie which is saying something
Dec 30 2022,positive,by far the best film of 2022 the low ranking here makes no sense from the incredible performances from the entire cast  especially alexander skarsgård  anya taylorjoy  ethan hawke to the glorious cinematography by jarin blaschke eggers and his whole team have created something that transcends and enthralls bravo a
Dec 29 2022,positive,an elevatedfeeling viking historical drama with action
Dec 29 2022,negative,absaloute shite avoid
Dec 29 2022,positive,the northman is one of robert eggers critically acclaimed films it is the most brutal yet harrowing movie ive ever seen with stunning visuals cinematography action sequences and the performances of alexander skarsgard playing the vengeful viking warrior
Dec 29 2022,positive,i was pleasantly surprised by the beauty and the magic of this film so refreshingly different from all the current viking fever fare
Dec 28 2022,positive,while i definitely prefer his previous films this is definitely eggars most cinematic and crowdpleasing film to date without compromising his attention to detail or unique vision its visually stunning and incredibly exciting a fantastic cast and a fantastic film
Dec 28 2022,positive,a refreshing film in an era of reboots remakes and attempts at cinematic universes great pacing the story is engaging the cinematography and direction by robert egger is fantastic and intriguing as always i really enjoyed it the acting was glorious skarsgard outdid himself in his role in this viking take on hamlet
Dec 27 2022,negative,grimey sweaty pretention at its absolute worst
Dec 27 2022,positive,a vengeance fueled norse tale is a very good tale with slow points robert eggers returns with another wild twisted tale yet the ending isnt as satisfying as we would have hoped it to be sequel possibly probably not but it doesnt hurt to dream
Dec 27 2022,positive,fantastic viking folklore brutal gritty with superior directing at first glance it seems like your typical revenge story however the narrative takes some unexpected turns
Dec 26 2022,positive,simply put  they should make more movies like this  this biggest fault about this movie was the advertising they advertised it as sort of a noir viking action when in fact it was a historical drama with some although great action   the acting was amazing skarsgaard was unrecognisable in some scenes the scenery was awesome   you could say that the whole story was something already seen its a good ol vengeance story however with a bit slower pace but better story
Dec 26 2022,negative,watched because we heard jre raving about this movie we did watch the entire movie but couldnt wait for it to end
Dec 24 2022,positive,captivating from start to finish pacing character depiction and story arc acting cinematography directing are all great and costume design is excellent some minor small issues stops it from getting a 55 rating hollywood needs more of these types of movies after all film making is an artform not just a cash cow also  fun to learn this as well as hamlet and in turn the lion king was based on the same story
Dec 24 2022,positive,dont watch the northman expecting something like the the vikings tv series this isnt about raiding but a movie interpretation of a saga and anyone whos a fan of reading the sagas will appreciate this a very personal story mixed in with old norse supernatural like many of the good sagas are beautifully shot and a satisfying end     those saying the story is cliché are familiar with hamlet and watched the lion king but are obviously ignorant to the fact lion king copied hamlet which was inspired by the legend of amleth this film isnt the cliché its based on the original legend
Dec 24 2022,positive,it just goes to show you can write a pretty damn awesome revenge story inspired by a real viking revenge myth that inspired shakespeares hamlet and you cant make everyone happy most likely oliver stone got his idea from this for conan the barbarian not the other way round people looking for the typical viking tv show might be dissapointed its brutal and it shows a delusional kid that loved his father and believes his father to be a good natured super hero finds out hes an immoral man and his mother is a manipulator and its possible the guy he was after all along might be the good guy in the story lol its a story that assumption can get you into a lot of trouble in life theres no winners here
Dec 24 2022,negative,if you like fantasy you might like it if youre looking for an action movie about the vikings youll be bored and frustrated
Dec 23 2022,positive,great cast great action and nobody force feeding you their personal messages  its drew a bit heavy on the mystical stuff and think it couldve been pulled off slightly better if left more real but a good flick nonetheless
Dec 20 2022,neutral,not very engaging intense but not compelling
Dec 19 2022,positive,best depiction of one part of viking culture i have seen this far
Dec 17 2022,positive,scandinavian hamlet extravaganza or what shakespeares hamlet wished he could be instead of skulking empty castles halls raiding rus villages robert eggers claims this is one of the most authentic and accurate viking movies ever made as you watch you will definitely start to believe it dimly lit dugouts as houses grand halls of kings with no windows mud and anguish swords are considered a luxury and the only way to get anything but an axe is to be rich or rob a draugr fortunately the narrative doesnt skip out on the spiritual aspect of seafaring raiders as the film is filled with dreams gods and premonitions alexander skarsgård is assured that his fate is sealed and that he has nothing but vengeance in his life regretfully northman doesnt really end up being better than lighthouse despite the 100 milliondollar difference not because the actors or the story are bad but because lighthouse gradually immerses you in its power dynamics and allegory whether northman has a rushed beginning and really meanders in the middle despite having a magnificent third act what also brings it down are the visual aspects due to being hellbent on realism the fire scenes are lit by fire and nothing else however when there is no source of light the movie uses a very pronounced filter that really betrays the atmosphere i am not saying you shouldnt be able to see anything but there are certainly ways around it the other thing is fight choreography by god it looks staged almost every single hit just looks sluggish and avoidable
Dec 17 2022,positive,the northman is a big departure from eggers usual work but not an unwelcome one the film benefits from his eye for detail and authenticity as well as his impeccable sense of pacing all this aided by great cinematography beautiful sets and sparse use of cgi help make this movie a very gracious take on what is in essence just a generic revenge story
Dec 16 2022,negative,amazing cinematography and director shot them well however the story just dragged  the main character is not much of a main character actor in my opinion and just was kind dull
Dec 16 2022,positive,the movie im really in shock with the beauty and savagery in this one and i love alexander so much and here omg this man is a monument a fortress a wall i cant breathe amazing
Dec 16 2022,positive,amazing movie especially if you realize what the director is trying to achieve
Dec 15 2022,positive,grotesque and shocking visually this movie puts a lot of effort into putting the viewer into the mind of a primitive and savage viking berzerker briefly this movie had a lot of scenes that were shockingly violent offputting or just inexplicably strange but entertaining the soundtrack was perfect and fitting to the mood and the acting overall was decent with notable standouts being from skarsgard who was all around amazing willem dafoe as a creepy soothsayer or hewitch was a treat ann taylor joy was convincing in her role and claes bang as the villain was pretty decent    from what ive read the berzerkers were no strangers to hallucinogenics  and the main character exhibits what i perceived to be hallucinations which accompany what is briefly shown as an extremely violent and hard life theres the soothsaying element that twists these visions he has into a just barely coherent intentionally maybe prophecy and intersperses some magicfantasy element that isnt confirmed to be real or imagined     the biggest con of this movie was it almost felt too committed to primitive savagery in a way that it couldnt deliver on the immersion enough for me to discount certain actions from the characters certain characters mainly skarsgards seemed to struggle with his heuristic adventure in some ways which were deranged and others which were totally understandable other characters reactions to his deeds were also confusing and hard to understand including the decision of the villain to upon witnessing skarsgard soaked in blood over his executed wife and son simply walk away and tell him to meet him at the gates of hel which was apparently a known location as skarsgard did just that later that day
Dec 14 2022,positive,a good movie to watch before your next football game wrestling match big fight or whatever sporting event where getting hyped up is crucial reading all the seething 1star reviews from the wokies after watching this 300esque gripping piece of cinema was the icing on the cake robert eggers minimalistic realismstyled approach to cinematography is well suited for this hostile time period to be alive in europe youll feel the cold of the wind and the grit of the mud while watching youll lose yourself in the stark dichotomy of the brutal existence that was the ancient world and the overwhelmingly lavish life we live today youll be hardpressed not to feel some stoking of your inner primordial being that yearns for a time when life was a gift and every moment you had was lived to the fullest not wasted in a phone or office building
Dec 14 2022,neutral,it was too slow for me nicole kidmans talent and beauty were not in full display i could not in good conscious recommend the northman
Dec 12 2022,positive,could be better and less time consuming
Dec 12 2022,positive,the best movie of the year by far
Dec 12 2022,negative,this was one of the most hilariously horrible movies ive ever seen the love child of rod stewart and madonna
Dec 11 2022,negative,absolutely awful go watch vikings instead
Dec 10 2022,positive,epic in every way if you are prepared to immerse yourself this film will pay back in spades the performances are transformative and its a really interesting take on the viking genre
Dec 10 2022,positive,great movie with plenty of layers definitely not for kids some younger adults may not appreciate the film as much as gen x and older millennials
Dec 10 2022,positive,i greatly enjoyed this movie from the acting to the score to the plot definitely a must see
Dec 10 2022,positive,i have scandinavian roots and everything ive studied about viking culture was so well depicted in this movie it had a great plot and mainly scandinavian cast which was a great choice to make this movie feel exciting and meaningful
Dec 7 2022,negative,so it happened i finally found a movie so bad yet so overrated i felt the need to create an rt account to try and tell the world how awful it is  what in odins beard is the point of this horrible film i mean granted it does have some action scenes and a not too bad scenery from time to time but the rest why does one have to waste the potential of so many highprofile actors  the characters are as deep as a puddle with no development whatsoever and the plot is what i would expect to be the result of alexa write me a viking movie this movie is so predictable i had lunch receipts with more surprising outcome  i have not seen anything so packed with painfully dumb stereotypes shallow dialogues and ridiculous plot twists in a long time and i have suffered through several peppa pig episodes and barbie movies in recent years  dont waste your time on this movie watch the trailer and dream up a viking revenge plot with the least possible effort i guarantee you it will be more entertaining than this
Dec 6 2022,positive,its hard for me to critique or give details about why i love this movie especially since i really dont watch many movies like this but ill try the performances are amazing the set design is wonderful the writing is beautifully done and the story brings emotion and tension even when sometimes i was confused about what was going on and that was my fault not the movies     robert eggers should be on everyones radars now between this and the lighthouse hes cemented himself as not only an amazing director but an incredible writer gonna watch the vvitch soon highly suggest this and the lighthouse
Dec 5 2022,positive,amazing movie and the ending had me thinking of this movie for quite awhile  cant wait to watch it again knowing what i know
Dec 5 2022,neutral,only 1 action raid scene after that its some secret plot bs silly af went from hard to soft and stupid
Dec 5 2022,neutral,a little to shakespearen for my taste
Dec 5 2022,positive,the northman is an epic yet meditative revenge tale that cuts more than bone deep with its complex themes and moral ambiguity
Dec 3 2022,negative,not worth watching basic storyline ruined by very poor production and the ridiculous abrupt ending expecting much better with the big name actors
Dec 3 2022,negative,dreadful dreary self indulgent full of cliches and so much copied from conan the barbarian 132 minutes of my life wasted
Dec 3 2022,neutral,theres some sick af scenes but its mid movie so rip  light 510
Dec 2 2022,positive,a true masterpiece it excels in every aspect of cinematography a carefully written script directed along with beautiful photography and a deep visceral trip into nordic culture
Dec 2 2022,positive,really good excellent fight scenes great photography good to see a historical film that at least tries to be accurate well worth the effort
Dec 2 2022,positive,this is definitely not for everyone but if you want a brutally honest look at an ancient pagan culture this is the movie for you
Dec 1 2022,negative,the northman is the best movie of the worst movie year its a horrific and boringly long predictable yawn of debauchery slavery filth and revenge that should be seen by no one and will not be missed or remembered
Dec 1 2022,positive,robert eggers persists on realism when telling tails as wild fathoming depths as bravely theres few directors that bring the surreal to life in the same way if films are perfect some can be almost such northman is a robust sensation taking all senses to appreciate its value i watched in theaters and it impressed me  even in the dim light and sound at ones home youre as easily swept away to a place you can never leave meant to see things you could never see unless this film existed performances here are convincing enough i never thought twice especially with how simply theyre written to play about a world completely alien alive and available the film provides color movement meaning and mystery all by its display on a screen theres moments in this film that transport you to places one simply shouldnt couldnt possibly perceive as if the film were created in a vacuum its untouched by time ill watch it again when im ready thats how special it is i dont wanna waste it
Nov 30 2022,positive,great film loads of blood and gore if you liked the vikings and last kingdom series then this film is for you
Nov 30 2022,negative,hard to tell whats going on mediocre fights and a mid storyline not worth the hype at all mid ending
Nov 29 2022,negative,i dont understand how anyone could possibly like this movie  it felt like a bunch of short films smashed together while doing acid    no plot jumpy storyline and nonsensical characters    just flat out awful
Nov 28 2022,negative,cheesey and cringey nothing compared to vikings and last kingdom
Nov 28 2022,positive,good film thought id give it a go think its the first full film ive watched and enjoye was a wonderful mix of vikings beliefs an customs but the ending noooo
Nov 27 2022,negative,stunning scenery but revenge certainly took a long time coming in this barely human brutal roaring grunting animalistic blood bath lacking in any character redeeming features
Nov 27 2022,positive,not what i was expecting tries to paint a more realistic picture of life for vikings the revenge part is fine but intertwined with supernatural stuff which wasnt for me  not an enjoyable film but does hold your interest
Nov 27 2022,negative,horrible especially if you compare this to the history channels viking show boring boring boring
Nov 27 2022,positive,was a great saturday night watch
Nov 26 2022,positive,eggers films probably arent for everyone so i get the slightly mixed audience reviews however they are for me a beautifully shot nordic revenge story like the witch feels like its set in its period and not pandering to 21st century sensibilities
Nov 26 2022,negative,worst viking movie ever pointless plot
Nov 26 2022,negative,misoginistic unoriginal and boring
Nov 26 2022,neutral,i heard so much praise for this film but after watching it i felt cheated out of a pleasant cinematic experience with such a fantastic cast i expected much more unfortunately the brutal violence is not enough to keep an audience intrigued with a story that zig zags too much
Nov 24 2022,positive,robert eggers has obviously read the same books i have regarding medieval scandinavian culture including ahmad ibn fadlans 10th century travelogue and scholarly books like the viking way by neal price many scenes seem to have been constructed with those books in mind  i love eggers obsession with getting the historicity perfect  the story itself was compelling and the acting good the mixing of the natural and supernatural is enchanting  the only criticism was the end was over the top
Nov 24 2022,positive,insane visuals a great watch if youre into a bit of a less mainstream format and movies with historicshakespearean style storytelling also great performance from alexander skarsgard as amleth
Nov 21 2022,positive,if you are a fan from action or superheroes movies this movie is not for you because is not an action and full of battles movie if you are a fan from scandinavian mythology symbolic art occult and magic or simply of good made cinema as robert eggers made on his two previous movies you will love this movie
Nov 21 2022,positive,visually stunning perfectly researched immaculately acted and driven with passion intensity and true viking valor this is easily a next step for director robert eggers already excellent career
Nov 21 2022,positive,accomplished what it should
Nov 20 2022,negative,considering the big names attached to this i expected more nothing stands out as exceptional and there were plenty of failures its fine if you dont think too much into it and you want a basic easily digestible plot special mentions spoilers     the whole side quest scene where the protagonist must find his magical weapon seems to be the only reason defoe is in the movie and hes not even in the scene    twisting the story of odins quest for knowledge to incorporate modern woke idealism is laughable
Nov 19 2022,negative,terrible acting and just bizarre story and cgi the only reason i lasted the film was i was intrigued if the film would get better im gutted i wasted 2hrs on a sat night and gutted because this should of been right up my tree great cast but poor overall production
Nov 18 2022,positive,visually arresting robert eggers commitment to folklore and historical accuracy immerses us in the world
Nov 16 2022,positive,a brutal and uncompromising revenge tale despite a conflict of themes the northman is a visual marvel that sees robert eggers further expanding his talents with a rocksolid ensemble to booth
Nov 16 2022,negative,boring and weird half way though i thought to myself this would have made a better play than a movie it seems to reflect a theatrical performance instead of a movie
Nov 16 2022,positive,cool movie not as good as the lighthouse but yknow
Nov 15 2022,negative,this is honestly the worst movie i have ever seen it is ridiculous on so many levels there are some big names in it that i cant believe they looked at the script and signed on to act in this debacle i dont walk away from many movies i start  this is one of the few i could not finish
Nov 15 2022,positive,if you have ever heard of hamlet youll immediately get the story the saga of amleth and his revenge against his  murderous uncle in a very authentic viking imagery this is no superhero movie it is a bloody saga where the hero gets his rightful ticket to valhallä small
Nov 12 2022,negative,i dont normally write reviews but i was shocked by the positive reviews of this movie this is a bad movie not worth watching  i wasnt really sure what this set out to achieve and by the end i was just happy it was over  personally i like dumb movies like troy and 300  i just couldnt get into this one
Nov 11 2022,neutral,a ton of weird moments during this film
Nov 8 2022,negative,dont waste your time  the mystical viking revenge storyline is so poorly executed here  character development is nonexistent and there are so many gaps in this story  we found this movie pathetic on many levels and the viking angle couldnt even save it
Nov 7 2022,negative,there is one thing every film maker must remembercharacters the audience care about no matter how authentic how visually amazing how star studded or epic nothing matters if the audience fundamentally couldnt care less if the protagonists live or die zero character development renders this movie dull soulless and utterly unengaging
Nov 6 2022,positive,while the movie pulled me in i initially it couldnt hold me the visuals were good it seemed to follow a pretty standard formula which gave it a generic feel at some points and when they attempted to go beyond the shallow violence it seemed as if they were trying a little hard for something deep   maybe worth 1 watch while eggers did a spot on job it doesnt compare to the 2019 masterpiece the lighthouse  it was still good to see willem dafoe up to his shenanigans
Nov 5 2022,negative,maybe i was expecting too much but this was a complete waste of time nicole kidman tries to have a weird accent and like all of the characters shes not developed enough for you to care about im  its been described as artsy and if thats code for terrible youre going to love it   theres so big names in this movie but it doesnt deliver   its disjointed   badly acted   the scenery is nice but these better youtube videos out there is thats what youre after
Nov 4 2022,negative,unbelievable boring great cast thou
Nov 3 2022,negative,the film was mildly entertaining at times but mostly disappointing  its much more fantasy than historical fiction  the attempts at plot twists could be seen coming a mile away and they threw in an unnecessary attempt at incest most likely for game of thrones fans  the film wasted too much time on drug hallucination and dreamvision scenes that added little real content the final nude fight scene was absolutely ridiculous for viking historical fiction the last kingdom and history channels vikings do a much better job
Oct 31 2022,positive,eggers continues to really put you there with this one the lands of the north are vivid and delightfully bleak the journey of the northman is textured and fraught with the perils of the life of a raider movies like this necessitate the existence of the medium there is no replacement for the immersion here watch it
Oct 31 2022,neutral,a tangent laden third act took away from a solid chase story  if youre here for ethan hawke or willem dafoe dont blink  its viking violence and some moments might require you to look away from the screen  there is also a supernatural element that didnt work for me and jettisoned me out of the film  well acted by some superstars and a beautiful film but it wasnt my cup of tea  final score 510
Oct 30 2022,negative,horrible  lot of violence  lot of weird stuff that just made no sense
Oct 30 2022,positive,roger eggers delivers once again and perhaps his best film this is a great viking story that has a shakespearian feel to it must watch and potential movie of the year candidate
Oct 30 2022,positive,i think its one of those where you love it or hate it i loved it if you embrace the weird and stylised offering from robert eggers its a thoroughly good time that feels like you are experiencing a true viking saga ill be thinking about this film for a while and listening to the score for at least the next week or so
Oct 29 2022,positive,not a movie i would normally pick to go see  the subject matter doesnt really interest me  but once i started watching this i was hooked  it isnt a traditional action film  it is more a revenge soap opera bathed in blood and weird voodoo atmosphere  there are parts that are slow but the pacing is mostly awesome  they maybe overdid it with the voodoo vision quest junk and the audio was not great but overall well acted and directed right up to its blood and body oil soaked conclusion  i also appreciated the more nuanced plotline that goes beyond just kill the guy that killed my dad  that that act of revenge will have its own consequences  and skarsgard is finally in a movie that doesnt suck
Oct 29 2022,positive,confusing  movie likes itself a lot
Oct 29 2022,negative,entirely too much barking for a movie not about dogs i cant believe they got these actors to be in it
Oct 29 2022,positive,artistic gorgeous and rich sound encapsulated vengeance in a tale that is unforgettable not an action film more of an epic tale of animalistic revenge primal visceral
Oct 29 2022,positive,if you liked vikings you will most likely enjoy this quite the cast acting is mostly fairly solid plot plods along in parts well it is 2 22 hours long with some decent cinematography and a few bloody battles
Oct 29 2022,positive,i liked this movie but boy is it heavy i like my movies to make me feel hopeful and inspired at the end and this movie does not do that it is a gritty telling of a viking prince who seeks revenge for what happened to him and his family i like gritty movies and i like historical fiction so i am going to like this movie i liked it the first time i watched it but i wont watch it again its just too depressing
Oct 28 2022,negative,this movie was slownot enough action
Oct 28 2022,positive,this really is a good movie if you are in to the vikings and norse mythology  while admittedly violent  it has a classic revenge story that anyone who loves those old clint eastwood movies would appreciate    there are also a bunch of top notch actors in this movie and cinematics are excellent i highly recommend it
Oct 27 2022,positive,i really felt immersed during this movie great action and an intriguing story
Oct 27 2022,positive,this movie is one of the best of the year i like the idea that robert eggers was given a big budget so that he can tell his story but i also understand why this wasnt a banger at the box office it is just not meant for the normal easy viewer but more for the art house and movie appreciation audience nevertheless for me this movie was insane the classic revenge story combined with the viking methodology was great and the action ahhhh the action was dirty and realistic in some ways i came out of the movie full of energy and i was pumped the cinematography is also toptier so if you appreciate movies that are sometimes slower and not easy to watch please go watch this movie
Oct 27 2022,negative,the critics seem to be assessing the behind the scenes people who brought the movie to the screen and giving it high scores  for someone who has none of that expertise or snobbery and just wants to watch a great viking movie i found it lacking in all the areas important to me  i was 10 minutes in before i had to take a break for a couple of hours too much howling like dogs for me i didnt connect with any of the characters at all ever and wasnt impressed with all the howling and carry on  i like a good spirit journey as much as the next person i just get tired of the relentlessness of this one  its a revenge movie and the outcome was obvious from the first scene when nicoles character raised her hand to hit the boy prince before reining herself in  of course it couldnt have followed any other path to the finale but i wasnt in the mood for shakespeare  i wonder if prince harry has watched it yet
Oct 26 2022,positive,its visually stunning and the cast is wonderful but its tedious really long and repetitive still worth a look
Oct 26 2022,negative,i got about 20 minutes into this movie before i turned it off what a stupid dumb movie i should just not watch any original programming on amazon prime because all of it sucks except for the boys also when i seen ethan hawke in it i knew i should have turned it off because he has never done a good movie and hes a terrible actor never name one good movie with ethan hawke there isnt one
Oct 26 2022,negative,the ending was lame and the entire movie was just flat i love the vikings and the last kingdom series but this one was just a bland and boring story definitely a no for me
Oct 26 2022,negative,this movie was horrible  with all the viking viewing choices available this one was not good  i watched this on hbo last night  i like the lead actors in it  but netflix vikings valhalla was way better than this and didnt have any of the a list actors  either the writing or directing ruined this film
Oct 26 2022,negative,is it possible to have worse acting the computer graphics are laughably fake the story is hilariously bad this movie is as bad  as caddy shack 2
Oct 25 2022,negative,watch the trailer the trailer was good the movie was not the problem is that the trailer made you think that you were going to see a cool movie set in the distant past with an interesting story what you get in the actual movie is a comic booklevel film best suited for 10 to 12 year old boys that can sneak away and watch an r rated  superhero type fantasy flic without their parents knowledge   hallucinogenic imagery may also appeal to trippers and stoners that left reality a long time ago but this film isnt for adults it is beyond silly and childish it is a shame it could have been great all it needed was a good script writer to write the exact same story for an audience of grownups that arent tripping and they could have had a real winner of a film
Oct 25 2022,negative,i had high hopes for this movie sadly i was very wrong terrible script ridiculous cginot to mention that apparently vikings had access to botoxtwo hours that im never getting back 
Oct 25 2022,negative,violent for violence sake  i got bored and didnt watch to the end  this is the sort of film which desensitises people
Oct 24 2022,positive,i liked the soundtracks the movie is not bad like many say
Oct 24 2022,positive,certainly not everyones cup of tea but i cant help but love such a visceral depiction of old sagas modern sensibilities and morality are refreshingly absent in a story about the violent life of a viking berserker
Oct 23 2022,negative,im getting so tired of critics giving thumbs up to lame movies because of the directors previous reputation    this revenge epic earned favorable reviews yet it features onedimensional characters clunking dialog a pretentious plot ripped from hamlet and inept underwhelming fight scenes    the long and short is even though there isnt a shred of humor in this film much of it is unintentionally humorous in fact it makes even the most mundane episode of the tv series viking seem like ibsen    anya taylorjoy really needs to choose her projects more carefully
Oct 23 2022,positive,conan the barbarian meets vikings an entertaining  if well trodden story well paced beautifully shot with a strong cast     a friday night beer and pizza special
Oct 23 2022,negative,not a single believable character in the whole movie the dialogue was pretentious to the point of stupidity and even that was delivered in husky whispers making it both annoying and even more unbelievable very very disappointing
Oct 22 2022,negative,the northman is a viking epic that didnt quite stick the landing the cinematography in this is absolutely stunning gorgeously shot and well made i found this rather boring and didnt appreciate it as much because i am not too familiar with viking lore so some of the story choices i didnt like and this movie is unevenly paced tries to be half art film half mainstream revenge flick i can say that i am not a fan of director robert eggers after seeing all 3 films of his this is pretentious and studios will think twice before ever giving him a 70 million dollar budget again the few fight sequences that they did have were stylishly filmed but theres not enough of it i like actor alexander sarsgaard but feel like he was too old for this role nicole kidman is playing his mother and shes only 9 years older in real life the ending was totally unsatisfying and thats why i gave it an even lower score than what i would have originally given it
Oct 22 2022,positive,the graphics and storyline were great i just hated to see him die at the end apologies if i spoiled it
Oct 22 2022,neutral,the overall narrative is lost in the weirdness of this movie the action however is amazing but the fight at the end is stupid
Oct 21 2022,positive,brutal and barbaric one hell of a ride
Oct 21 2022,negative,what is there to like about this movie the acting is terrible the plot has been overdone many times blood and gore and senseless howling and yelling i kept watching in hopes that it would get better however it did not i would not watch this movie again if i was paid to do so
Oct 21 2022,negative,this is the worst viking show ive ever seen
Oct 20 2022,positive,a truly phenomenal retelling of shakespeares hamlet  skarsgard as amleth is a smoldering burn of rage and confusion  anya taylorjoy as olga continues to prove she is a powerhouse of acting as well as a nebulous beauty on the screen  ethan hawke  claes bang were remarkably good as the king and his usurping brother  and willem dafoe again displays his creepy engaging wonderful style last seen in the lighthouse  i really liked nicole kidman as amleths mother gudrun she is beautiful pathetic violent and vengeful  really wonderful  the movie is particularly gorey but the gore is part of the authenticity of the story and contributes to the hellish choice amleth makes at the end  one wonders wo giving too many spoilers does the prince make the right decision in the end  director robert eggers takes a much darker and cynical view of the story than shakespeare and far more pagan and prbbly far more true to life read some of those norse sagas and you get an idea of the constant cycle of revenge that infected pagan norse culture  and that alone is why this movie is so intriguing  it doesnt try to give some nambypamby milquetoast message of social justice but rather asks what life might be like without a defiance of augury  what happens when we reject the special providence in the fall of a sparrow and seek instead to right the wrongs of the world by our own bloody hands  can the ocean of violence be overcome by more violence  at what point must amleth state that he has shot his arrow over his house and has hit his brother  and if he doesnt is it sufficient reward to dwell in valhalla until the darkness of ragnarok consumes all  hard to tell what eggers thinks  but he certainly presents the question well in a violent dark engaging and magnificent story
Oct 20 2022,positive,wow a slow burner that managed to keep me glued to the screen  a revenge story with amazing acting and cinematography   it was especially impressive on the big screen  probably my favourite of the year
Oct 20 2022,positive,its both reassuring and disappointing that when a director as singular as robert eggars is let loose to play with a big budget and big names the result is still singular in style even if the bones of the plot such as it is give us what amounts to a pretty conventional revenge story its reassuring in that its important that distinctive voices maintain their edge disappointing in that it surely wouldnt have compromised his vision too much to make a few concessions to those who come to this expecting something more conventional     i really liked the bold unsettling the witch i was much less taken than many by the wilful alienation of the lighthouse im between the two with the northman at times visually extraordinary at other times this feels like its almost too concerned with proving this is still a robert eggars film it approaches the hoary ground of style over substance are we actually allowed room to feel and think are the actors given any space to breathe complexity into the characters i suspect the answers to both those questions err towards no     when it works well it flies high and shows off what could have been other times it feels all surface no feeling  and worst of all a little bit dull
Oct 20 2022,negative,such a waste of time very graphical
Oct 19 2022,positive,once i realized i didnt like it because i believed it to be real i also realized it had sucked me in almost 100 still i thought more than once hmm this is what happens when its cold  wet all the time and you have never heard of reading writing mathematics and electricity weird thoughts i know
Oct 19 2022,negative,id give it zero stars if i could
Oct 19 2022,negative,its like watching wwe when it comes to the fighting
Oct 19 2022,negative,this movie is corny as hell everything about it is irritating
Oct 18 2022,positive,this movie is a work of bloody art literally cgi and special effects work was very good to spectacular characters are believable  the acting is excellent they are portraying flawed humans in a long dead culture and pull it off you connect with them i felt they held true to norse mythos the dialogue is a little challenging at times but give it some thought and in relation to the scene and story arc and you will piece it together the only nit pick i have is the valkyrie had braces but hey who knew vikings had an excellent dental plan watch it and enjoy the scenery rage and vengence
Oct 18 2022,positive,wasnt expecting the movie to be that engaging but had my full attention loved the soundtracks and the way vikings have been portrayed liked the theatrical style monologues  wish some of the characters were a bit more medieval like makeup wise  fight scenes couldve been better
Oct 18 2022,positive, am someone who tries real hard not to buy into the hype of things i understand movies are good but like a new shiny toy every movie seems to be the greatest thing in the world until the next new movie comes around i knew that this was hyped up and i figured i was going to like it and probably give it a 35  4 star rating well to me the northman is legit a 5 star movie it has everything i look for in a movie and checks off every box for my criteria of what i want to see its perfectly dark and twisted even bizarre at times theres action and gore and awesome dialogue throughout the northman is the reason why i love movies and it reminded me of that that its ok to just love a movie i do believe the northman is definitely not for everyone and i can see areas where others wouldnt get it or just not what they are into also like any movie certain things could happen without a build up and make the 2 hour movie into 15 minutes but then we wouldnt be here talking about anything
Oct 18 2022,positive,the symbolism in this wonderful film is quite lovely  joseph campbell author of the power of the myth would have been thrilled about this movie for certain
Oct 18 2022,positive,a blood for blood movie loved it captured by choice for revenge
Oct 17 2022,positive,even though the story is very bare bones robert eggers brings in fantastic visuals with great details that it is still a joy to watch there are so many interesting shots that leave the viewer questioning what reality is although that can lead to a bit of confusion i was still able to keep up with the ideas presented the acting in this film was amazing all around i really enjoyed nicole kidman and alexander skarsgård performances the romantic relationship between alexander skarsgård and anya taylorjoy did feel a little half baked and underdeveloped though the action in this movie is few and far between but when it does peak its head out it in brutal and visceral leaving audiences gasping at the bloody details and gore the action was done really well with not many cuts and incredible choreography overall this film was really great and i wish i would have watched it in the theaters    score 87  verdict excellent
Oct 17 2022,positive,exreamly well shot and intense movie slow burn that builds to a great climax
Oct 16 2022,negative,i thought this was going to be another epic movie with huge battles glory and vengeance  it wasnt the weird religious and incest overtones was too much
Oct 16 2022,negative,this movie is by far the worst movie in the history of vikings movies ive been a fan of vikings my entire life but the horrible acting the cringed makes it all a true sad disappointment of a movie
Oct 16 2022,positive,visuals outstanding plot muddled very dark both visually and mentally scene where hero gets the sword is right out of indiana jones
Oct 15 2022,positive,honestly its exactly what youd expect from an eggers viking film a slow burn violent beautifully filmed flick that wont be for everyone for those whos wheelhouse it is in youll love it
Oct 15 2022,negative,a movie where you dont like any of the characters and you wont care if any of them live or die
Oct 15 2022,positive,absolutely beautiful to look at and also brutal to watch loved it
Oct 15 2022,positive,this movie isnt a straight historical drama its a mythology enshrined epic featuring supernatural aspects to the tale its the kind of story a viking would tell another viking not something you would read in a history book visually it was beautiful almost psychedelic at times the kind of gore infested shamanic trip youd expect from a berserker themed story  the acting was wonderful and i thoroughly enjoyed the movie not a happy movie per se but definitely one worth watching i wish more movies were this good
Oct 15 2022,positive,isnt bad as people think honestly
Oct 15 2022,negative,  absolutely terrible made me consider canceling my prime membership
Oct 15 2022,positive,could have been  epic but needed significant editing one time watch
Oct 15 2022,negative,the sets and settings are beautiful but there is almost no character development and therefore a complete waste of some pretty good actors it just seems like a movie made for slashing and gashing
Oct 14 2022,positive,this movie was excellent i appreciated how they weaved fantasy into the movie without making it unbelievable while there were some flaws in the movie the movie was suspenseful and entertaining and the ending was so moving
Oct 14 2022,positive,very immersive gritty visual spectacle that really shows the aspect of the barbarian warriors of those eastern countries
Oct 14 2022,positive,whilst the first 10 minutes may be a bit arty for some the movie as a whole is phenomenal and id urge anyone to stick with it like a work ripped straight out of an original saga truly epic
Oct 14 2022,negative,i think i enjoy clipping my toenails more than watching this movie the casting was terrible  so the mom nicole kidman had the son when she was 9 and the northmans love interest is young enough to be his daughter ugh the accents were dreadful and the plot was predictable and tiresome only plus was seeing the iceland landscape and some male nudity
Oct 13 2022,positive,this was a visually stunning wellacted welldirected and beautiful piece of art however i had so many people overhype this movie that it just couldnt live up to the reputation that preceded it
Oct 12 2022,negative,that movie was terrible  the dialogue was bad and the plot made no sense
Oct 12 2022,negative,even though there are some recognizable visuals the film is poorly written the story foreseeable and the directing and acting couldnt be worse if anyone is looking for quality entertainment its best to save the time and look elsewhere
Oct 10 2022,positive,an outstanding viking movie based off of shakespears hamlet  if you are looking for a norse 300 you are sure to be disappointed  if you are looking for a more realistic viking tale you are in luck  dark violent but an incredibly wellmade movie  there are not many movies of this quality out there and i appreciate the hard work that went into making it a reality
Oct 8 2022,positive,fresh great acting mostly great direction
Oct 8 2022,negative,awful dont watch it
Oct 8 2022,positive,ancient and beautiful violent and yet meaningful to the story unique and refreshing among the current hollywood trends this wasnt a movie made for the sake of gratuitous violence every moment told a story it was a pleasure to see that hollywood can still make an epic mythologicallike tale that felt real yet magical with imagery befitting dark poetry i could not find fault in any of it and im a pretty hard viewer to please  if i had any critical points at all it was that amleth sounds a bit too much like hamlet and the story is similar as well but whether that was intentional or not matters little to me it was a welltold story with a good script beautiful cgi and cinematography and very wellacted by all the cast and it was wonderful to see some famous faces in this movie branch out into something so unique i was hesitant at first to view it based on some of the reviews about how violent it was but honestly ive seen far worse than this movie if violence is the only thing stopping you from viewing it reconsider its worth it its cinematic art
Oct 7 2022,positive,this overwhelming art film is a bit different from what someone whould normally except out of a revenge story nevertheless it has tense moments and ends in a powerful catharsis
Oct 6 2022,negative,it was utterly wasted time and money the worst so called viking film very disappointed
Oct 6 2022,positive,brutal violent yet a compelling watch about betrayal revenge and love combined elements of viking mysticism with adventure and action in a movie that sucks you in and doesnt let you go until the very end
Oct 6 2022,positive,its a cross between an a24 movie and a parody of an a24 movie incredible single shots and artistic visuals terrible accents
Oct 4 2022,positive,a straightup great revenge movie with swords
Oct 3 2022,positive,it was watchable and just barely above passable  i almost would have liked a bit of a turn for the protagonist but that wasnt going to happen out of a24    not one of the better flicks to come out of that studio but it was better than the average stuff    it is crazy violent but then considering the subject matter how could it not be
Oct 1 2022,positive,its a treasure of the epic language translated for cinema great story great interpretation and visually astonishing
Sep 29 2022,negative,slowmoving and juvenile the acting was so bad i ended up questioning whether this was a spoof or was serious the imagery was simplistic yet overstated the production quality was very poor as well  hard to believe this was intended for theaters
Sep 28 2022,negative,crap movie i was actually on my phone for the final thirty minutes looking the reviews to confirm my thoughts then it came to the final  few scenes where it was wrapping up the alreadybland story and that was an utter disappointment the best part of the movie was with the first five minutes with willem defoe and the obviously overchoreographed battle the rest was filled with long pointless scenes that didnt contribute at all to the plot an action revenge story with no action very disappointed wish i could get my money back if you value your time here on earth do not watch
Sep 28 2022,neutral,the cast was great the scenery was brilliant and the cinematography was amazing unfortunately the plot was an utter flatline no character development of any kind or suspense and an ending that could be seen coming from several hundred miles away
Sep 28 2022,positive,impressing visuals great casting amazing soundtrack and incredible atmosphere  its nice to see some more historically accurate vikings instead of the clean sanitized ones that permeated hollywood in more recent productions
Sep 27 2022,positive,solid movie with great actors and visuals but i cant say its anything special
Sep 26 2022,positive,great movie  not for the squeamish for sure  its a nordic revenge tale so whats not to like
Sep 25 2022,negative,so boring i know when the critics like it im going to hate it definitely great camera work and fits the dark and gritty look its going for but so slow and boring it was just not a fun watch not everything has to be that but at least keep my attention
Sep 25 2022,negative,story is pure vomit i was so frustrated to watch such an awful movie with so much nonsence
Sep 25 2022,positive,great movie plot was very well developed
Sep 25 2022,positive,based on the original tale that inspired hamlet youll find yourself constantly worried about the characters what wondering what drives men to hate very enjoyable
Sep 24 2022,negative,this was the worst movie ive seen with so many good actors one think it could be magnificent but its a pain to see not worth the time just awful
Sep 24 2022,positive,interesting yet sometimes disturbing plot the costume design and the settings were fantastic skarsgård didnt really work for me but kidman and bang had such a dark layer to their character that they made quite intriguing villains
Sep 24 2022,positive,i enjoyed the northman despite some serious issues visually stunning and continuously interesting like his previous films but extremely slow paced with some odd directing choices that feel careless or lazy however still definitely worth a watch  ill probably watch again
Sep 24 2022,positive,loved every minute of this film blending the gritty realism of the time with myth and magic of the norse gods its a feast for the eyes and ears i truly do not understand the negative reviews truly  im merely sad that they didnt enjoy it as much as i i loved the witch and the lighthouse too so eggers is a star to me  i dont have a favorite they each deal with different themes and styles of story telling  but he proved himself again to be a master at his craft the writing is perfect  the acting perfect the visuals perfect the story perfect  simple yet divine  a for me
Sep 23 2022,negative,made by professionals but this movie screams out amateur great sets do not a great movie make
Sep 23 2022,negative,this movie was shaping up to be the worst film i had ever seen until i decided to pretend it was meant to be a comedy it worked and i couldnt stop laughing at it
Sep 23 2022,positive,this movie movie was very airy dark headed had a pretty decent story also there was a lot of things things are overdone and left dangling
Sep 22 2022,negative,this was just boring
Sep 21 2022,positive,really enjoyed this movie it seemed more on the artistic side it might not be for everyone but was quite good and i liked seeing the famous actors in the film
Sep 21 2022,positive,a visual marvel like few others it might not be the most original story but the execution of this movie is so utterly perfect that i was completely blown away by its beauty and grandiosity a cinematic spectacle in the most epic way
Sep 21 2022,positive,probably one of the most average movies i have seen in a while  probably could have cut 30 minutes out of this movie very easily and it would have been far more enjoyable  i am all about gore and violence but they may have gone a tad bit overboard at parts here  worth a watch though over anything else coming out these days
Sep 20 2022,negative,the  northman was a huge disappointment this is the first film that i have ever felt the need too fast forward in hope it would suddenly improve and no it did not  such weak acting and basic storyline
Sep 20 2022,positive,in particular i love how the mysticismmythos was woven into the story not overdone not underdone perfect balance some complain that there was not enough  violenceaction some say the opposite i thought the movie was fantastic
Sep 20 2022,negative,poor story waste of time seriously
Sep 19 2022,negative,i didnt think itd be possible to make a boring movie about vikings but here we are    from the first opening scene i thought it resembled the lighthouse and the witch afterwards i looked it up and realized they are all the same director he certainly has a style and really enjoyed it for the lighthouseand sort of for the witch     this movie looks great its creepy and dark uses black and white here and there to good effect the actors tower and look imposing the violence scenes are gruesome and fun to watchwhen they happen and thats the problem    this is a viking movie with virtually no viking activities aside from the opening scene there are no battles there is no raidingpillaging there is no running wild in england and ransacking churches it is a slowvery slow revenge story with a mystical element intertwined he grows from a boy to a man covertly becomes a respected member of his targets clan and lives amongst them for years it seems till he ultimately gets his revenge     this movie is book ended with violence and almost the entire middle is meandering nonsense all while beautifully shot at least    he knows how to make a good looking movie they just arent always enjoyablethe northmen and certainly even if you enjoy them they arent fun to watchthe witch or lighthouse
Sep 19 2022,neutral,first 45 mins was not bad nicole kidman ruined it mostlyacting but the thing that annoyed me is old norse saying meet me at the gates of hel  from a norseman then they go to a volcano as if they are trying to drag in christians hell of fire and mixing it with norse hel niflheim pretty much opposite to what it is even if they had the meaning of the goddess hel it still makes no sense then taken by a valkyrie ending was pretty rubbish it was like dragging a body for views worth the watch but i wouldnt watch it again i was actually looking foreward to watching it skarsgård hawke and dafoe great as usual
Sep 18 2022,positive,a dark gritty movie which i enjoyed but it is not for everyone
Sep 18 2022,positive,authentic viking movie with stunning cinematography alexander skarsgård and claes bang are superb however it is slower than expected and the best parts are in the trailer
Sep 18 2022,positive,absolutely fantastic and true to historytime period
Sep 17 2022,negative,junk movie  dont waste your time  boring and match reviews
Sep 17 2022,negative,too abstract to be a coherent story    this is a gore fest without any understandable storyline the mythological elements dominate the movie rather than being an addition to the main plot    basically if you dont want plot be consistently confused but want to see men at their worst then watch this film
Sep 17 2022,negative,got to be one of the worst movies ive ever seen  plot was dreadful storyline awful very poor acting pitiful screenplay  if i had paid to rent i would have turned it off  whoever thinks this film is artsy must be on the same mushrooms they fed to the guards in the film
Sep 17 2022,positive,before anything else i would say this cast is near perfect  to see alexander skarsgard goes from a bit more lanky in true blood to bulking up in this film was more then a shock  this film in itself is a shock to the system in that it is not like other films i have seen  the cinematography is very well done  in some ways it reminds me of alfred hitchcocks film rope in that it had very few cuts  many one shot scenes makes everything make look much more visceral then what we were ready for i liken it to a less hollywood version of vikings  it is not afraid to get its hands dirty none of the characters are weak in any sense each have their own place and are used well  i could try and ready you for this film but anything i would say may fall short because there is just so much to take in with it  quite the ride to take though i would recommend leaving the kids at home for this one
Sep 16 2022,negative,im sorry for myself to watch this highbudget video there is no story and the characters have no depth the actors are terrible and the fight scenes are actually funny the director tried to mash sin city with every other fantasy movie and it turned out to be a garbage mix of scenes they call a movie it is an insult to human intelligence
Sep 16 2022,positive,this was a really good realistic movie about the viking era be warned its not an epic feel good like braveheart or gladiator its much more realistic and true to the times know that before going in to it and you will enjoy it much more fantastic
Sep 15 2022,negative,please stop putting nicole kidman in movies she cannot act
Sep 15 2022,negative,there is nothing more nordic than half naked men fighting for family justice oh wait it could be a good movie with a more detailed story line but as his mother threw him over the fence so did the producers to us  too bad that this budget was not enough for a decent movie in a scenic view and good actors
Sep 15 2022,positive,dont walk into this thinking your getting a viking war movie  this is an amazing and stunningly original take on viking mythology told on the platform of revenge religion and brutality
Sep 15 2022,negative,you have to be a simple minded dense individual to think this is a good movie 
Sep 14 2022,neutral,honestly had no idea what half the dialogue meant in this tbh
Sep 13 2022,positive,been long waiting for a movie like this to come out brutal intense  faithful to vikings history doesnt sanitize its action or story the fact that this movie didnt get the credit it shouldve is criminal
Sep 13 2022,negative,they didnt focus on the storytelling they just tried make it artsy bs movie
Sep 12 2022,positive,the northman is an epic bloody revenge movie with really amazing cinematography and great cast and directing
Sep 11 2022,positive,a true norse epic definitely not for everyone but my god every frame truly was a painting it was definitely a vibesbased movie where you didnt come for the story or characters as those werent that interesting aside from a few specific instances but the sound and cinematography and just the general feel and pace of the movie were extremely compelling and had me hooked the entire movie
Sep 11 2022,positive,nothing short of incredible film making
Sep 11 2022,positive,wow what a movie it makes hamlet look silly and excessively hesitant the story and the visual and audio artistry is fierce dark and beautiful with its mythology and its iceland scenery the female characters are strong forces the men should heedbut dont which leads to the inevitable end the music the language and the darkness make this a haunting story a revenge of sorts on the bard who adapted this story and tried to tame it the real version is raw  and so that much more believable
Sep 11 2022,positive,a true viking story great writing and acting  the visuals sound and effects are immersive   we need more movies like this
Sep 10 2022,positive,the hype of the film promised alot but delivered little to none
Sep 10 2022,negative,this aint got nothing on the great vikings tv show
Sep 9 2022,negative,it dragged  it was filled with dreary darkness and lots of ritual chanting  did i say it dragged  i have no idea why nicole kidman agreed to waste her time in this film  she had a miniscule part
Sep 9 2022,positive,this is a story where you can relax because there is no political agenda mixed in finally just a story for the sake of the story i really enjoyed it and recommend it to friends
Sep 9 2022,positive,robert eggers delivers the most brutal epic viking movie to date
Sep 8 2022,positive,amazing movie if it was made in a different time it would have won awards if you know why then you know
Sep 7 2022,negative,umwhatif you like gore and art house story plots that drag on with confusing endings this film is for you
Sep 7 2022,positive,this is a beautiful revenge movie that starts slow but gets better as it goes with some brutal moments
Sep 7 2022,positive,this movie was fantastic the plot is based off the original shakespeare story hamlet but it is executed perfectly i found the cast to be amazing as well as the cinematography the cinematography was beautiful and badass there was a lot of creepy and gruesome elements to the film as well overall a must see film
Sep 7 2022,positive,solid performance by all  lighting was a little too dark for some scenes  had a very frank miller comic feel  i imagine the film is based on nordic folklore and if so its themes can be found in many cultures  like the bow which developed on different continents by different people who could have at no time interacted there are some feelings and thoughts that remain universal
Sep 6 2022,positive,the visual aesthetics performances and writing in this film are fantastic it captures the spirit of norse mythology and the sagas very well attention to detail is especially welcome in terms of historical accuracy few works of tv and film are as faithful to the viking era as this    the lower user ratings tend to come from peope who were expecting a more straight forward and generic action flick the tone of this film is far more shakespearean and serious which may not be everyones cup of tea personally i loved it and was fully immersed in the world presented on screen in an age of lazy filmmaking and cgiinfested cash grabs we need more films like this
Sep 6 2022,positive,full of blood and guts the northman is a true viking film that its powerful emotion cant be denied as strong and resourceful
Sep 5 2022,neutral,indie movie with a budget if it were half as good as the trailer it would have been awesome
Sep 5 2022,positive,saga of midgard heroes journey norse mythology badass spectacular film
Sep 5 2022,positive,very bloody with a weak plot
Sep 5 2022,negative,too just too weird with mostly unlikeable characters when i want some viking gore ill just rewatch the 13th warrior
Sep 5 2022,negative,the northman is a film that tries to visualize the vikings fundamental beliefs with fantastic things but even though it has good visuals the story bored me because of the choice of storys progress i was seriously bored especially in the movies second half because of those ups and downs unfortunately i watched a much calmer movie than expected i expected a wilder more aggressive and gruesome film cant say anything to the acting the shooting all great but for me the most essential thing that makes a movie a movie is the script director eggers unfortunately remained weak in narration while making his style speak the film which will hit the hearts of those who care about visuals seems to upset those who focus on the story like me
Sep 5 2022,positive,great movie a rare movie these days that is depicted historically accurate without the injection of current politics and wokeness  this should be celebrated throw your money at this
Sep 5 2022,negative,i liked some of the cinematography but this movie sucked  if you like this type of film watch the series the last kingdom or game of thrones and avoid this one
Sep 4 2022,positive,realistic fighting scenes maybe not as acrobatic as we are used to lately but focused on how the fights would probably broke through
Sep 4 2022,neutral,a bit slow needed more gore and less weird praying
Sep 4 2022,positive,one of the best movies of 2022 great effects fight sequences and stunning depiction of vikings
Sep 4 2022,positive,northman is a incredible epic history of vengance that explores perfectly the nordic mitology in my opinion is a great adventure with amazing ending the northman is a masterpiece
Sep 4 2022,negative,went into the film expecting it to be grand and entertaining did not meet any of my expectations whatsoever as it turned out to be a dull and small revenge story there is no character build in any of the characters even if you can understand the leads motive of wanting revenge it still adds nothing some of the dialogues were straight up cringy
Sep 3 2022,positive,the gladiator with vikings not as good as the gladiator though but it has some amazing visuals and is well worth it recommend watching it while enjoying a dram of highland park or ardbeg whisky
Sep 3 2022,negative,unwatchable  terrible   lets seebad acting to say everyone was overacting and chewing  scenery is to understate note to director screaming is not powerful  a scream is different than a roar  pigs scream lions roar  plotand outcomedone better elsewhere this succeeds in making mythic storytelling into something small dirty and silly   this is a poor reproduction of schwarzenegger in conan with none of the grandeur  wonder or magic put on conan the barbarian go watch that
Sep 3 2022,positive,captivating story with a satisfying ending rarely has pacing issues and always keeps the story moving
Sep 2 2022,positive,amazing i loved that the movie really held true to the time period and didnt make all the vikings from the lgbtq community  refreshing to see a movie with no political agenda
Sep 2 2022,positive,a powerful revenge story with quite a few disorienting elements  i was mesmerized and sort of uncomfortable throughout for reasons i couldnt always explain
Sep 2 2022,positive,kinda of anticlimactic
Sep 2 2022,positive,incredible movie the imagery was perfect the cast was perfect and this director is quickly becoming one of my favorites after this movie and the witch
Sep 2 2022,neutral,its too slow  good photography  an interesting look at norse myth 
Sep 2 2022,positive,well made magnificently written and beautifully shot it is a bold film that may not be everbodys cup of tea but is definitely worth the watch
Sep 2 2022,positive,robert eggers unique filmmaking style finds its way into norse mythology as his latest feature is a viking epic alexander skarsgård and anya taylorjoy shine in this brutal tale of betrayal and while the films visuals are impeccable their performances are ultimately the best part of it im not a fan of the lighthouse or the vvitch but i must admit the northman was actually a good movie
Sep 2 2022,positive,good movie acting is not perfect that his weakness
Sep 2 2022,negative,dreary and violent  hated it
Sep 1 2022,positive,damn it was awesome seeing what inspired shakespeare to write hamlet
Sep 1 2022,negative,dislike this movie  a obviously ending story with bad special effects poor quality image normal performance for some great actors  a waste of time and money
Sep 1 2022,positive,truly a phenomenal film it had great action and great acting and a compelling story it deserves oscar nominations for next year 1010
Aug 31 2022,negative,awful movie such a disappointment
Aug 31 2022,positive,storytelling at its finest   everything about this film was done perfectly from acting to directing and screenplay the viewer is transported to the land time and culture that the story takes place although it has a unique audience the northman is a cinematic masterpiece
Aug 30 2022,negative,this might be the worst movie ive watched in the last 15 years im a huge got fans so no issues with violence here i am offended by this awful movie though  premise  promising  execution  terrible    dialogue you can barely understand 1 dimensional characters  even the protagonist has no redeeming qualities or character development  with the lack of detail in the movie they could have told the whole story in a trailer just bad
Aug 29 2022,positive,it was fine stuff happened then it ended couldnt really see the point of making it and doubt id even have bothered watching if i wasnt on a long haul flight and ran out of options
Aug 27 2022,negative,the worst movie ever
Aug 27 2022,negative,where the art of film making go this one is straight 2 hours of the art of butchery sex and sorcery  it would be a better film if actors would not speak that broken english pretending to be an old icelandic  norwegian languages what a grotesque version of a legend
Aug 26 2022,positive,the northman has a simple revenge story yet it is somehow still a very unique film thanks to the director robert eggers  the viking setting the use of norse mythology the gorgeous cinematography and visuals the way characters speak the phenomenal performances the bloody action sequences the terrific music score the historically accurate costumes and the set design anna taylors buttocks  all of these manage to elevate a generic story into some truly distinct and breathtaking    the movie isnt going to be for everyone the dialogue can feel a bit corny the supernatural elements can feel a bit weird and the pacing isnt as intense as one would expect for a revenge story despite all that i enjoyed what robert gave us and it is definitely a viking film to remember
Aug 26 2022,positive,no explanation of why he needed to return as a slave  he was so much older there was no need for a disguise    also hes supposed to be either ulhedinn or berserk but he doesnt fight out of control hes very calm and cool most of the time yes he does bit someones throat but that looked deliberate not because he was in a frenzy    its not nearly as good as id hoped and as some critics claimed and not as authentic as claimed
Aug 26 2022,positive,fantastic so goodi really cant get over it i delayed seeing this bc of the violence people talked about but i just shut my eyes for a couple scenes that i knew were going to be too graphic for me i am so glad i made time to see it moviemaker has an amazing knack for delving into a culture and then presenting it honestly see the witch highly recommend 
Aug 26 2022,negative,i began laughing after the first 20 minutes its a complete mess of a film truly terrible critics seem afraid to call it a bad film but its a bmovie dressed up and presented as art dont waste your time
Aug 25 2022,negative,i cannot get over how terrible this was i had to google the reviews to make sure i hadnt missed some critical piece of information that would make it all make sense the idea that this is remotely comparable to gladiator is a joke it just seems like a muddy viking bloke howling at the moon and being angry and depressed i too am very bored with the continuous stream of marvel spandex superduper villain twotters but if this is the competition then spandex away i imagine it going onto vod 3 weeks in has probably ensured the film didnt come out 20 million down pity
Aug 24 2022,negative,im about an hour in and im giving up boring excessively masculine far too serious and up its own arse one of those films that thinks its arty but just makes me roll my eyes and sigh
Aug 24 2022,positive,not over the top with unrealistic bs solid acting and story
Aug 23 2022,positive,whilst the faithfulness to viking lore is commendable i just find the film a tad boring after a while the scenary is stunning
Aug 23 2022,positive,slow but thorough buildup with a lot of existential imagery and shakesperian undertones  it was dreary but the violence was bloody good
Aug 23 2022,negative,i got really bored really quick with this
Aug 22 2022,positive,good one but made with detailing in alot of subjects so watch it with that sense in mind and actual history visuals in mind
Aug 22 2022,negative,i just didnt connect with it seemed like a bunch of scenes that didnt flow together at least i own it and can give it another go at some point
Aug 20 2022,negative,i think hollywood should stick to good cop bad cop  movies and leave the viking themed movie making to the professionals almost a joke movie
Aug 20 2022,positive,a breath of fresh air in a time of mediocre cinema
Aug 20 2022,positive,this live action lionking remake was amazing
Aug 19 2022,positive,loved it  fantastic cinematography borrows heavily from hamlet yes its violent  yes its bloody  yes its brutal  yes its mysogynist or however they spell it yes there is slavery no there is no hollywierd message like i said whats their not to like
Aug 19 2022,negative,it started out interesting with a conan like narrative in the beginning and somewhat accurate depiction of vikings in the opening scenes after that it went downhill  its a movie its not a viking movie
Aug 19 2022,positive,awesome visuals top notch actors and a very bloody and savage hamlet take
Aug 18 2022,positive,i will admit i watched it just for alexander skarsgard  it wasnt my favorite movie for me it was too gory but i was engrossed enough to finish it
Aug 17 2022,negative,one of the worst movies ive ever seen total trash with boring and stupid story
Aug 17 2022,positive,awesome movie its kind of shakespearean and may not be what youre expecting at first but its really good and really beautiful it has a bit of a magical realism thing going on and its fantastic on multiple levels i highly recommend it
Aug 17 2022,positive,the northman reminded me that cinema can and should be an artform made by people with actual artistic vision instead of a conveyor belt producing forgettable formulaic content designed purely to make a return on investment
Aug 17 2022,negative,overly dramatic and terrible story 13th warrior came out in 1999 and its still the best viking movie in my opinion the northman shouldnt even be considered a viking movie its just another fictional movie with a made up storyline
Aug 16 2022,negative,we purchased the movie and watched it last saturday nighti was disappointed and mostly because of the story line  the acting was ok but the filming was rather poor especially with the lighting  the way the vikings acted was so animalistic it totally turned me and my wife off  i wouldnt recommend this movie and my rating is 369
Aug 15 2022,negative,this movie is a hulking garbage truck on fire screatching and screaming while driving over a cliff i watched it while on a flight and i was praying that the plane would nosedive into the ground
Aug 15 2022,positive,i waited to watch this due to mixed reviews however if you are a fan or norse mythology and have some interest in the period you wont be disappointed captivating beautifully filmed a wonderful norse saga others have said they found the story difficult to follow but it is straightforward if your thing is dwayne the rick johnson youll probably find this a bit too hard to get
Aug 15 2022,positive,the northman was really dope filled with tons of testosterone and very robert eggers plot is pretty much a darker version of lion king lots of hilarious oneliners in the background you might miss beautiful cinematography and lighting fantastic acting i liked it more than the lighthouse but i think after seeing that film i hadnt really enjoyed it at the time i now know what to expect with eggers projects and can appreciate them more now the northman feels longer than it actually is but if you like these style films youll love this one
Aug 15 2022,positive,great story telling and writing realistic characters and a historically accurate portrayal of the time period a great revenge story
Aug 15 2022,negative,really weird story not a very good movie
Aug 15 2022,positive,movie of the year for 2022 well so far anyway i can see this not being for everyone but if you have any love of the icelandic sagas this is them brought to life in a way that is as true to those stories as humanly possible its brutal beautiful and compelling top notch performances from every adult actor as well i was especially surprised at how good nicole kidman was here
Aug 14 2022,negative,the northman is a simple revenge tale set in ancient viking culture the story is dull and plodding and the depiction of the vikings is highly polished and sanitized in this movie the vikings walk around with seamlessly stitched garments silky hair and white teeth the brutality used in the movie is ultimately superfluous because after the northman litters the landscape with bodies in the end the he cant even defeat a soldier thats been tilling the land for years
Aug 14 2022,negative,absolutely dreadful film despite a promising list of actors and actresses the storyline fell miserably short of my high expectations    fight scenes were laughable to watch there were multiple scene transitions that made zero sense and the script was diabolical    save yourself 2 hours and watch something else
Aug 14 2022,positive,wonderful spectacle of harsh brutal reality of the ancient times entangled in the myths of the nordic gods magic and old believes a story of a man binded by inevitable fate and consumed by revenge to the point of madness deep meaningfull image definettly worth to see
Aug 13 2022,positive,visually stunning film with a basic revenge plot costume and set design was top notch they clearly did a lot of research it couldve been a little shorter though some scenes seemed unnecessary it was also hard to hear the dialogue sometimes
Aug 13 2022,positive,epic norse revenge tragedy that looks spectacular but somehow lacks real tension or emotional weight
Aug 11 2022,positive,original story not some recycled material with great actors
Aug 10 2022,positive,very original story and very visually appealing acting is meh but still worth a watch
Aug 9 2022,positive,great acting and cinematography was top notch  pacing sometimes was plodding but when it chose to include action sequences it was great ties to mythology were cool  i could watch this again this wont be everyones cup of tea tho
Aug 9 2022,negative,dont waste your 2hrs on this 
Aug 8 2022,negative,they could have made this movie so much better but instead its a movie that was not enjoyable to watch if i could have gotten a refund i would have overall not a good time at the movies
Aug 8 2022,neutral,beautifully filmed with exquisite attention to detail yes but this is ultimately a standard revenge tale that unfolds on a long slog tragic arcthe kind of story youve probably seen one too many times before interestingly though i just learned that the northman is based on the legend of amleth which in turn inspired hamlet so that maybe offers a new way to watch this film
Aug 7 2022,negative,the movie cant commit to being either a fullon mythological tale or realitybased adventure so it rides the fence and fails to live up to either genre also it wouldve benefited from more of an excellent nicole kidman
Aug 7 2022,positive,robert eggers brutal viking epic is superb stunning cinematography wonderfully cast and a healthy dose of uncompromising violence  this tale of revenge is not for the faint of heart
Aug 7 2022,negative,two stars for costumes and special effects but no stars for character development story telling and script another epic where i couldnt care less about the characters its not that theyre unlikeable i just dont know who they are as they grunt vengeance will be mine ill see you in valhalla etc etc etc the young amleth must avenge the death of his father the king amleth grows up and kills a bunch of people on the way to achieving this goal who cares   normally i refuse to pass judgment on a movie if ive slept through some of it ill make an exception for this very expensive waste of space
Aug 7 2022,neutral,revenge but not so sweet lame
Aug 6 2022,positive,holy shit i didnt expect much from this movie in fact i didnt even want to watch it initially but im glad i did this movie is insane my favorite movie of 2022 so far
Aug 6 2022,positive,brilliant film full of truth in casting no african viking lesbians in this one
Aug 4 2022,negative,ugh if i could insert a puking emoji here i would because thats all it deserves
Aug 3 2022,positive,test user review 01
Aug 3 2022,positive,the northman is a beautiful tale of revenge its a slow burn but i was never bored at any point during the movie
Aug 3 2022,negative,you cant put lipstick on a pig  it was soo ssllloooo to the point of boring and the plot was a retread  the only redeeming quality was the terrific landscape panaromas  hope they were real and not computer generated  highly recommend if you have plenty of time to waste
Aug 3 2022,positive,im a fan of robert eggers and this period piece lives up to his reputation as a detailobsessed recreator of historic settings  the plot while not new is an interesting retelling of the hamlet fable  while it falls short of the genius eggers demonstrates in the witch its a worthy watch for those interested in another tale of revenge
Aug 2 2022,negative,it was very long and talky most of the way through the fight scenes were slow and you could tell their acting unlike other films plain acting and boring narrative the ending was lacklustre
Aug 2 2022,positive,i wish that we got movies like this more often such a beautiful yet brutal film i really enjoy robert eggers style and it is all over the place here i went in expecting a fast paced action heavy revenge thriller but that is not what this is and im happy about that this is much more slow paced and much more stylistic which makes this film stand out from others with similar settings or plots you are unapologetically thrown into the brutality of this time period and forced to stay there and the result is an incredibly visceral and beautiful yet brutal and devastating setting and all of the elements of the film such as the plot script performances cinematography etc all compliment this setting and story making this film feel very cohesive it will not be for everyone and it will take some people a while to settle into this world and get used to the stylistic choices and i dont think its the most rewatchable film out there but i am so glad that it exists and i had a great time watching it
Aug 1 2022,negative,weak sauce no feeling bad acting dp was amateur
Aug 1 2022,positive,trippy and fun antihero saga
Aug 1 2022,negative,boring it was painful watching it till the end
Jul 31 2022,negative,an allstar cast that on paper looks like a great film would come from such talent  unfortunately it turns out to be an embarrassment to these accomplished actors at times i found myself simply laughing at the absurdity of some of the scenes its not a bad premise but the storytelling is just so silly and disjointed it becomes laughable i was really expecting so much more i take no real pleasure in writing this
Jul 31 2022,positive,the cold of ice in airin veins   wolf on hinds wolves in minds  hunt they will for what thats theirs  kings kin fall by arms draugr bears  a rich culture traditions beliefs and lives of men and women in old nordic lands reincarnated masterfully
Jul 31 2022,negative,terrible  worst movie of the year by far
Jul 31 2022,positive,meh had its moments but fell flat as it continued skarsgard is wonderful visually its effective but the relationship between skarsgard and taylorjoy needed some brewing
Jul 31 2022,positive,i thought this movie was really good  it was well made in all areas and aspects    however i can totally see why a lot of people did not like it
Jul 31 2022,negative,what a waste of time time
Jul 31 2022,negative,truly awful  after devouring vikings and the last kingdom we were excited for this movie  unfortunately it was long on wth violence and questionable supernatural visions short on substance acting or anything to hold your interest at all  skip it
Jul 30 2022,negative,oh boy where should i start this movie was very heavily promoted with voluminous writeups in all major outlets including nyt as a massive 70 million mass market breakthrough for eggers and it got decent reviews in mainstream media too having seen the witch and the lighhouse  two previous movies by the director  and having liked them both a lot when i shelled out 7 for an online rental in hd i expected to see if not a cinematic masterpiece then at least an attempt at one imagine my bewilderment when it turned out to be almost comically bad at times veering into the sobaditsgood territory my overwhelming feeling through watching all 2 hours of this movie was acute embarrassment for those who made it lets start with the vaunted authenticity of costumes weapons dwellings ceremonies etc allegedly eggers would not use anything less than meticulously reconstructed replicas of museum specimen though i am not an expert on material culture of vikings i attended my fair share of medieval festivals replete with reconstructed viking camps and reenacted battles to recognise a bad halfassed reconstruction when i see it everything in the movie looked secondrate to me except perhaps for swords ахеs and shields  those looked pretty good but costumes houses and temples looked pretty lowbudget and so did various ceremonies including the viking funeral  a totally wasted opportunity to make an impression by staging a massive scene but the most pathetic of all were the fight scenes and there were much less of them than one would expect in a typical viking movie all reviews raved about this continuoustake scene of a raid on a rus village where the protagonist is shown as berserker on a killing spree so i was looking forward to that what a disappointment it was just a threeminute badly if at all choreographed amateurish reenactment with zero authenticity or realism i have seen better sword fighting battles staged at abbey medieval festival near brisbane three weeks ago than anything shown in this movie then comes the weirdly accented english interspersed entirely randomly with old norse allegedly for no obvious reason then there is old slavic allegedly spoken by the rus  whoever consulted eggers on that basically just scammed him out of the money but i soon realised that all that nitpicking about authenticity was completely beside the point because it was not a historical movie but a fantasy of the conanthebarbarian kind  full of magic swords witches valkyries intelligent ravens and flying horses so i wouldnt even mention it if it wasnt made such big a deal in all promotional materials so forget about historicityauthenticity does this movie work as a fantasy no it fails on that count too the story line is primitive to nonexistent  it is lifted in its entirety from the story of hamlet with a single original twist at the end when his mother tells amleth yes even the name is the same that his father was the real villain and she begged her noble lover to kill him and her own son but even that twist changes nothing in amleths motivation and behaviour  he still proceeds to kill everyone in revenge the dialog is so poorly written that it almost make you cringe at times and much of it is unnecessary anyhow the characters are entirely schematic and dont develop through the plot at all its like they are not even human but some bots programmed to say the lines hardwired into them the actors do a decent enough job with what little licence they were given but everyone is so badly miscast for their part that you have to think it was done on purpose i have never seen a movie where every major character was so completely and utterly miscast as in this one it still grates on my mind  seeing a fugitive viking price going on a revenge quest with a berserkers single minded determination and with a face and mannerisms of an accountant at the end of the movie i was scratching my had about where the hell did that 70 million go must be cgi for the amputated nose
Jul 29 2022,positive,a little bit dull  its not bad not by any stretch of the imagination and wonderfully grizzly however as it progressed i found myself feeling increasingly bored by it reasonably good ending and a little bit of a surprise coming from one of the storys threads but some of the lead up to the end after the first 30 mins or so seemed a little lacking and really did drag on quite a bit there were some jarring moments that reset me a little but those moments were quite few and far between youve really got to be in the right kind of mood for this one at least i think so which is worth being mindful of
Jul 28 2022,positive,definitely had a little hollywood influence that wasnt necessary especially in that last act but overall the movie was amazing  definitely dont take your kids to watch it though 2 little kids were balling in the back of our theater until their grandma finally took them out about 10 minutes into the movie this movie does not shy away from the insane pagan imagery which could be a turnoff for some but i greatly appreciated it this movie did not make paganism look fun or rewarding and i loved that all forced sex were only mentioned and not shown    also anya taylor joy is probably my favorite actress at the moment  she keeps knocking it out of the park and the northman was no exception
Jul 28 2022,negative,considering the cast subject material and reviews i expected to enjoy this movie but mostly i was bored the pacing was atrocious most scenes were drawn out way too much a boy stares out from a wall forever did we really need to watch the king ride all the way through the town i understand the need to set a scene and introduce characters but it doesnt take that long it reminded me of those movies and shows where characters spend a long time doing mundane tasks like brushing their teeth pointless and boring then i looked up the director and understood why i disliked this movie i dont care for his work its really sad because there have been so few movies ive looked forward to in recent years that makes this one doubly disappointing
Jul 28 2022,negative,one of the worst movies i have ever watched  i was expecting big things on the back of vikings
Jul 28 2022,negative,this was truly awful the film did a good job of showing norse mythology and culture but it was too dark and way too many posed shots and looks and pretty much zero plot the revenge was even sad and pathetic not surprisingly this film was an epic box office failure and that cannot be blamed on people not going to the theater nobody wanted to go to this movie
Jul 27 2022,positive,epic with stellar performances and an interesting quest this film will have you until the end possibly one of this years best films im not too familiar with viking films but im glad this one exists
Jul 26 2022,negative,after watching the 1st two seasons of the last kingdom which i feel is the gold standard the northman falls well below par
Jul 26 2022,positive,well this is complaining on an incredibly high level because its definitely a little bit of a letdown for me after eggers incredible first two its almost as immersive as his previous movies its incredibly well made but it also has some distinct flaws for a start i hate the vaguely nordic accents the actors do took me out of the moive a little from the beginning i know this is a common trope in hollywood movies but a filmmaker like eggers should be better than this either go all in and do it all in nordic with subs or let the actors speak normal english its silly and i always hate this english with accent nonsense apart from this minor thing the movie is a bit hollow i e its basically all surface again its incrdibly well made but heres nothing in here that reflects upon the nature of revenge or the toxic masculinity on display here    again this is complaining on an incredibly high level obviously this is a really good revenge movie its still very idiosyncratic and avoids many of the pitfalls and cliches of generic hollywood movies and its definitely the best viking movie ive ever seen high expectations often leads to disappointment and thats definitely the case for me it does lack a little bit of that special eggers touch of the witch and the lighthouse
Jul 26 2022,neutral,breathtaking visuals dont compensate for an ultimately boring tale with stunted dialogue and overuse of dream and vision sequences in place of the action you might reasonably expect disappointed that this is far from the epic saga foretold with actors that could do far more with it
Jul 26 2022,negative,after reading the reviews on here my love for anything vikings related and the beautiful skarsgard and not to mention the great cast i decided to give this movie a try after twenty to thirty minutes of watching i realized how terrible the movie was going to be by the end i was just in absolute disbelief while the sets and graphics were a admittedly fantastic  thus the reason for one start instead of half of a star  there should be other things involved in a good movie a decent plot is the first thing that comes to mind     i think the queens role played by nicole kidman was terribly terribly miscast i can normally handle the weekly movies that kidman pushes out but this was just too much then there is the humansactinglikedogs part of the movie literally acting like dogs fifteen minutes in there is a scene with the king and his son where they are down on all fours growing barking howling burping and farting yes you read that right    when you see skarsgard in a movie these days you expect that bodyofagreekgod that he has the problem is that the majority of the men in this movie are stunning  in terms of physique  which is highly unrealistic of what they would of really looked like     im not sure if bad acting and badly miscast actors made the storyline bad or viceversa but the movie was just allaround terrible unfortunately i paid 20 to watch it in my opinion that makes this movie about 25 overpriced please dont waste your time on this nonsense
Jul 26 2022,positive,brilliant movie that depicts the plundering vikings as brutal and vicious as they were without compromise while at the same time subtly teaching audiences about the saga that inspired the play hamlet and giving a glimpse into their mythologie and culture as good as it is possible in a movie
Jul 26 2022,positive,if you have a taste for bloody violence and a stomach for brutality you owe it to yourself to check this movie out its the original hamlet story without the moral equivocating showing both masculinity and femininity at their respective execrable worst and their glorious best
Jul 25 2022,positive,great movie overall has a good variety of unusual aspects and blood and gore has some straight up disturbing scenes which make a movie more exciting good acting also would watch again
Jul 25 2022,positive,honestly i was more interested in iceland environment than the movie
Jul 24 2022,negative,over the top filled with tiresome prophecies and solemn traditional chant and drum music it is exciting in the first hour but then it is just repeating themes with quite absurd ending
Jul 24 2022,positive,a bit dark the production is impeccable
Jul 24 2022,positive,visuals were stunning good old fashioned revenge tale with an amazing backdrop 
Jul 24 2022,positive,very good looking film full of spectacle it doesnt really feel like that events fit i think as a trippy legendary heroes type movie its great
Jul 24 2022,positive,underrated movie most people who dont like it are just basic and should stick to watching disney  
Jul 24 2022,positive,one of the better movies of the year that most people didnt see its dark gritty and visually beautiful the lead was well cast and is a great actor in his own right
Jul 24 2022,neutral,wow ive seen every viking movie and show ever made and this was one of the most convoluted and confusing ive seen the fight scenes were ok so it gets 25 stars meh
Jul 23 2022,negative,this was a hodgepodge of immortals 300 game of thrones and gladiator mixed up into one horrible movie  the characters had zero depth and the action scenes looked like they did everything first take  there was no one to pullroot for in this catastrophic film  i had to apologize to the tv afterwards  sorry buddy the preview looked pretty good
Jul 23 2022,negative,what a load of rubbish this movie was luckliy enough for me i didnt buy it i was leant it i could only watch the first 20 minutes then had to turn it off as it was unbelievable
Jul 23 2022,negative,it began as a promising movie bogged down with character development and finally degraded into a what the  ending  save your time and ignore any hype
Jul 23 2022,positive,fantastic wild ride of an original script
Jul 22 2022,positive,one of the fucking reasons for why this masterpiece is still an underrated in our country is because the hindi dubbing of this movie is available nowhere the language barrier makes most of the masterpieces underrated
Jul 22 2022,negative,i couldnt get past the first half hour confusing violent and grim
Jul 22 2022,negative,my wife and i just rented this movie after seeing high reviews here we only made it through around 10 minutesit all just seemed over dramatic over acted with a style that wasnt believablewe just couldnt keep watching and had to switch off wasted our money on this
Jul 22 2022,negative,so so bad  turgid from start to finish  weak plot with ludicrous hallucinations taking up an hour of the film  not saved by a stellar cast  avoid at all costs  so bad that it drove me to set up a rt account in the hope of saving other poor chumps 140 mins of their lives
Jul 22 2022,positive,a beautiful visually stunning interpretation of a classical epic
Jul 21 2022,positive,quite an unusual combination of bloody battles and visual beauty  this is not a straightforward revenge flick but full of ancient languages religious lore
Jul 21 2022,negative,a good cast of actors in this movie but its barely watchable  to much shouting and screaming blood and gore and hardly any dialogue
Jul 21 2022,positive,imagine if bjork dreamt of braveheart while watching gladiator with a copy of hamlet on the nightstand after masturbating to 300 the northman with its beastly animal personification is savage and primal the subtext is more than a mere nordic mythology it truly questions  what is a man what is good and what is evil we follow alexander scarsgards abrippling journey assuming hes the protagonist but a reveal in the second act leads you to question is he our hero or is he the vengeful monster his muscle laden traps and shoulders carrying the weight of revenge literally turning him into a beast clawing to his devastating destiny 
Jul 21 2022,positive,maybe its just me but i find it odd to watch kidman and skarsgard from playing a couple in big little lies to playing mother and son in this movie  the first half of the movie was good and kept me engaged but the second half started losing sense in the plot
Jul 21 2022,negative,wed been looking forward to seeing this movie based on critics opinions but oh what a profound disappointment apparently its easy to pull the wool over the eyes of professional critics  all you have to do is incorporate a tiny notion from shakespeare and a name that sounds like hamlet  and away you go put together a mockery of a movie and noone will dare criticize it    within minutes you will be pulled into an ambiance of unrelenting darkness and evil without a glimmer of hope humor or light you will be subjected to 2 hrs and 17 mins of base barbarism hatred hacking disembowelment bloody gore cheap poetry cheap hackneyed sex scenes and a singular boring predictable plot line about characters you could not care less about a conglomeration of ideas stolen from other creative minds shakespeare tolkien it has none of the purpose or significance of an engaging story the critics applaud it as casting a light on our time well if senseless demonic loathing is what you want to be subjected to in your free time  go ahead watch it  eat your heart out literally    in the end when it mercifully comes are we supposed to feel empathy for the protagonist or his two ugly progenies a man who shoved women and children into a barn and burned them alive without remorse please  give me a break the only joy will be when you run out of the room fix yourself a drink and look forward to never ever watching anything from the creators of this utter waste of your precious 2  a bit hours
Jul 20 2022,negative,this movie was a huge waste of time usually anything with nicole kidman is worth watching she rarely misses this time she did this movie is terrible mostly boring payoffs are not worth the wait
Jul 20 2022,positive,well crafted the attention to detail was amazing
Jul 20 2022,positive,more screaming than dialogue but i liked the style and the execution not 300 but also not trying to be very unique
Jul 20 2022,negative,this is a real dumb movie
Jul 20 2022,negative,with a cast of a star actors i expected much more instead got a b grade performance  the story line is too basic and annoying scenes as men behaving like incoherent beasts  embarrassing to watch  dont bother its too long and tries to hard to be somethings its not  watch vikings again instead for quality
Jul 20 2022,positive,it leans in to arthouse pretentiousness with its gore but its visual spectacle and character battles are worth viewing
Jul 19 2022,positive,despite being almost ridiculous it never stretches into being too ridiculous
Jul 19 2022,negative,skip it  not sure why i thought it would be worth paying for
Jul 19 2022,negative,waste of time boring cliche plot and story
Jul 19 2022,positive,a brutal and uncompromising revenge tale despite a conflict of themes the northman is a visual marvel that sees robert eggers further expanding his talents with a rocksolid ensemble to booth
Jul 18 2022,positive,definitely a unique style of movie but i still enjoyed it
Jul 18 2022,negative,i really wanted to like this movie  alexander s is one of my favorite actors  unfortunately the movie is slow poorly organized and makes little sense  i kept asking why would you do that
Jul 18 2022,positive,the ending went way too long given that the final result of story was literally told to us in the 2nd act
Jul 18 2022,negative,worst movie ive ever seen not even worth the time it would take to write more here just wish i could get back that 2 hours in my life
Jul 17 2022,positive,violence revenge and hope for the future all together in a story full of symbols myth and the reality of the world of 850 ad northmen russians slaves women men children and gods it has it all sort of like today without guns artillery or nuclear weapons we are on our way     great images
Jul 17 2022,positive,its the best film ive seen in a while its absolutely impeccable i am out of words to describe it
Jul 17 2022,positive,this was pretty good  i liked it
Jul 17 2022,negative,truly awful had i paid for this movie i would have asked for my money back and wished i walked out i would like 2 hours of my life back for enduring this
Jul 17 2022,negative,once again eggers tries for artistic and winds up with unintentionally comical  ludicrous dance scenes gratuitous fights against stupendously inept foes and mawkish attempts to jam hamlet into the vikings with obscure mutterings and cut rate visions
Jul 16 2022,negative,visually cool but so damn slow all they do is yell and grunt watch the first fight seen with shirtless alexander skargard after that save yourself 2 hours and watch something else 
Jul 16 2022,negative,wowthat was awful i was a big fan of vikings and other offerings from the genre so gave this a go after about ten minutes it was so boring i turned it off then i thought id better check the reviews to see if i would be missing out and it was just a slow starter i saw it had a score of 89 so persevered i wish i hadnt the whole thing is just weird from start to finish the scenes where he goes to seefinds himself with i was never sure which it was the seers were all completely random and made no sense i found it very selfindulgent at times and incredibly boring there was a little bit of random action here and there but the pacing was just really off couple that with some terrible acting from nicole kidman random pointless cameo from willem dafoe and a plot that just doesnt make sense and youve got yourself a recipe for cinematic disaster avoid this movie at all costs
Jul 16 2022,positive,better than thor jane foster  batman
Jul 16 2022,positive,this was a fairly enjoyable watch
Jul 15 2022,negative,with the great cast i honestly expected a good movie alas my wife and i were immensely disappointed in this film the story starts out ok but then it gets stranger and stranger the storyline drags on forever and you get a wtf did i just watch feeling at the end dont waste your life watching this pick about any other movie and youll be better off
Jul 15 2022,positive,hamlet the original story in wich shakspeare sought inspiration to his work     the biggest quality of this film is the vikinguesque tone the ability of the production to set the chosen tone through a sense of cosmology much more close to the original viking culture that bore this story than by the lenses of the ocidental jewishchristian culture of today it lends the film a mix of nearanthropolgic estrangement and otherwordly awe    at the same time the movie wisely steers from stylistic hermetisms keeping the feet firmly on the ground storywise it makes an excellent effect differently of what happened in the profoundly frustrating the green knight 2021
Jul 15 2022,positive,a revenge epic coupled with all the mysticism blood and spirit of the viking age definitely worth a watch
Jul 15 2022,positive,from beginning to end this is a gredespite its dark nature the movie was well received because it was unique and different from other movies in this genreis genre
Jul 14 2022,positive,a great film and even better considering that it is a blockbuster but an auteur blockbuster the second best film of this director only behind the lighthouse
Jul 11 2022,neutral,popcorn and gore nothing special entertaining for a saturdays evening at home but nothing too fancy     i would have regret paying a cinema ticket to see this
Jul 10 2022,positive,simple plot but interesting and good action likable characters with a strong moral attitude
Jul 10 2022,negative,wtf did i just watch
Jul 10 2022,neutral,great first half of the movie second half felt drawn out
Jul 10 2022,positive,what it came down to was the will to make sacrifices on your own and the will to fight for what you want the most even though it was very violent and unwillingly vicious the northman does a very good job on providing a well deserved story about choosing your own destiny without somebody else choosing it for you
Jul 10 2022,negative,boring and stupid  from willem dafoe and the guy from training day to plastic face nicole kidman it was hollow slow and unrewarding total bore and a total hollywood flop they should stick to making things explode and cgi cartoons for kids
Jul 9 2022,negative,one of the worst movies i have seen in a long time so bad i actually activated my account here to write a review and warn you not to pay a cent to watch it even our dog was revolted by it shame on nichole kidman and alex skarsgard for stooping to this  soooo disappointed 
Jul 9 2022,negative,the over the top melodrama of a basic revenge plot is too much for me  im not sure how they convinced these fine actors to make such a pedestrian movie
Jul 8 2022,positive,i was extremely pumped for this movie so for it to only get 35 stars is a bit of a disappointment  i thought this movie had so much more potential and could have been a 45 star but it fell just short in a few areas  the ending in my opinion isnt that successful and could have been much better  i was hoping for more scenes like when they raided the village but that was pretty much all that we got until the very end  well shot movie the cinematography was great i was just wanting a little more viking in this movie and more action still overall a good movie
Jul 8 2022,negative,the worse movie i ever saw
Jul 8 2022,positive,this is definitely worth watching the biggest knock is that the film advertised would have been a much more enjoyable film what we got is good but even a revenge tale can have bombastic set pieces which are shown in the trailer dont know if its allowed but id recommend vinland saga on amazon prime an anime whether you enjoyed this and want more or felt like it didnt live up to what you expected
Jul 7 2022,positive,what truly caught my eye in the northman was its gorgeous cinematography it was incredible how wellexecuted it was as they gave multiple perspectives of characters simultaneously and followed action smoothly throughout the narrative it also led to some ingenious visuals as well while director robert eggers leans more into the practical effects side of filmmaking there are still times when it seemed cgi was necessary the practical effects were so smoothly edited in at times i nearly couldnt tell the difference which led to some surreal and brutal imagery     along with impressive visuals the script is very creative and has a heavy shakespearean vibe to it now i am not the first one to say that shakespearean english is difficult to understand at times but in the northman it never feels incomprehensible in fact it is quite poetic this version of dialogue never felt out of place and in fact felt like it took direct inspiration from shakespeares hamlet but its storys themes are also hard hitting as they take a dark look at the toll of vengeance and the ties that bind a family together the dialogue and the story hit hard and stick with you and i have a feeling this film will be quoted for years to come    did i even mention the performances alexander skarsgaard shows his savagery as our titular viking having what seems to be an inhuman physique with an animalistic dominance but at the same time he also shows a very compassionate and gentle side to his character as his quest for vengeance unfolds we also got nicole kidman giving us initial damsel in distress vibes until she reveals a malicious side to her that devastates our vicious protagonist and turns the story on its head but possibly my unexpectedly favorite performance has to be claes bang as our villainous fjolnir he is first portrayed as an envious and powerhungry brother but as the film progresses his motivations become clearer and more complex while anya taylorjoy is amazing she feels underutilized in the story and ethan hawkes performance left me wanting more    the northman is a rare film that is as unflinching as it is engrossing its epic story and classical dialogue mixed with its visuals make for an unsettling yet rewarding viewing experience with phenomenal performances throughout eggers direction from previous works fits seamlessly in this film and keeps his creative winning streak going ensuring that not only is the northman a fantastic and vicious take on a viking epic even by viking standards but possibly eggers best work yet
Jul 7 2022,positive, a dark and melancholic atmosphere which is underlined by the music and the cinematography which includes a lot of shots and scenes without much light and lots of blood   the acting    there are neither good nor evil characters   the helmets of the vikings dont have horns     sometimes the plot is either too slow or too fast    in the beginning amleths and olgas relationship is a bit questionable
Jul 6 2022,positive,great movie you might be disappointed if you are expecting a full on action movie as its certainly not that kind of a movie but i thoroughly enjoyed it quite trippy in places utilising norse mythology
Jul 6 2022,positive,an artsy exercise in presenting a viking legend as it might have originally been told its a simplistic story set in a natural world filled with magic and prophesy  as a movie its a mixed bag  there are great individual scenes of realistic brutality and trippy weirdness but they dont necessarily coalesce in a satisfying way
Jul 6 2022,positive,visually stunning with great scenes and scenery and great production design but too overlong for what it has to say more concise it could have been a masterpiece but in this state feels too many times like a goaless wandering the main character is underwritten so its hard to get involved more than the revenge factor a little underwhelming on that part but the cinematography is great and the direction with many long continuous shots is deeply entertaining it is good we get a chance to get an artsy movie with than budget just sad it is not a total masterpiece and it didnt get any succes
Jul 6 2022,positive,a grand norse epic with dazzling effects a fresh yet familiar story a stunning cast and a solid performance from skarsgard that glues the film in one modernday braveheart this is one of the best films of 2022 in my opinion
Jul 6 2022,negative,firstly  let me just qualify this pre covid i went to a movie in a theatre 3x a month i watched streaming series and movies enough to safely say i see 50 to 75 movies a yearobviously less so nowespecially since there is so very little quality cntent being made  this is no exception it bombed at thetres for a reason it is uneventfulboring horribly directed and acted the room to make a spectacular drama was hugebut what they made was so small it felt like a tv movie  it is terribleand cemented why i cannot stand nicole kidmanshe overacts and always looks exactly the same the love interest od anna t joy was a veryvery weird choice the accents were hilariously bad  stay away from this movie unless youre drunk or a stand up commedian
Jul 6 2022,positive,it is a very good film little by little you will feel the adrenaline and i dare say the thirst for revenge i loved
Jul 5 2022,negative,this would rank as one of the worst movies i have seen which has been given high recomendation from your critics  it is not even entertaining  it is a movie which should never have been made  to read your critics praise of this movie brings to mind the kings magic suit of clothes
Jul 5 2022,positive,best movie of the year so far eggers needs to keep making masterpieces and not worry about the woke police
Jul 5 2022,positive,good but you need to know a lot about norse gods and beliefs in order to watch it
Jul 4 2022,neutral,unfortunately i was disappointed especially after all the hype i like the skarsgaards all of them but i kept wanting alexander to hold his head up the mixture of hamlet and arthur with a bit of oedipus thrown in was a bit much  kidman didnt help standing there with no depth of character whatsoever amleth whining about a miserable life yet apart from slavery to his uncle he seemed to have an ok life fjòlnir is made the hero of the film bleak and depressing frankly
Jul 4 2022,negative,horrible movie  painful to watch if i had paid to see this i would have walked out
Jul 3 2022,neutral,had some cool moments but honestly just was not my thing
Jul 3 2022,positive,intresting and unique very emotional ending
Jul 3 2022,positive,mauro lanari   net of some slipups in the heroic fantasy of conan a hyphen or an obelus  between the date of birth and that of death is what we find engraved on each tombstone and is todays version of the 3 greek moirai the 3 norse norns the 3 hindu deities of the trimurti the beginning the duration the end the destiny of every cosmic entity its fate its predestination since nothing and no one is allowed to selfdetermine ontologically if refns valhalla rising 2009 limits itself to exposing a primitive and ancestral violence if joel coens macbeth 2021 forgets this essential element of shakespearean tragedy instead eggers draws on such root of the true epic the ineluctability and unchangeability of what has already been brutally and deresponsibly decided of our existences of which we are actors and spectators but not directors free will as a chimera meat puppets a wrong metaphysical model maybe other myths prospect the tree of life but not malicks 2011 blinded by the grace he sees everywhere nor the esoteric aronofskys the fountain 2006 that doesnt work so what
Jul 3 2022,neutral,simple plot of revenge there are some decent performances by alexander skarsgard and nicole kidman but there isnt enough character development to really care about any of them other than skarsgard what was impressive was how he physically transformed himself for this film he looks like he put on 40 pounds of muscle he is usually skinny like in his scenes in this seasons atlanta or old true blood episodes  i read in some critics review saying the end was brutal i was expecting some extreme gore and violence but instead got less than star wars revenge of the sith when obiwan defeats anakin by the lava and is burned alive even the early season of the walking dead had more cringeworthy scenes i guess i was expecting more
Jul 3 2022,negative,looked forward to this film but was disappointed  but did watch all of it   sure it had all the adventure and violence expected in a viking movie cinematography was good acting ok  but some real leaps in the story like the main character waits what30 years before finally seeking revenge  what was he doing between when he promised himself revenge when fleeing and when he was finally reminded of the oh yeah  oath hed sworn to himself  and how old was his mother 30 years later that shes still cranking out a kid whos about 8 or 10 in a time when people usually died by 40
Jul 2 2022,positive,i was really hoping for something better  a super great cast including skarsgård kidman and taylorjoy great views of northern ireland and svínafellsjökull  they really help set the place and time some part of the story however was just missing this is not as good as gladiator or braveheart  maybe to me it was just the edit but ill keep wishing for a movie worthy of odins time
Jul 2 2022,positive,first things first movie starts well and the whole prehistoric portrayal was good and dont expect a lot of dialogues just try to enjoy the visuals speaking of visuals they are on point and the casting was also fine   overall a fine experience definitely would recommend if you are into the whole gladiator vibe
Jul 2 2022,positive,a brilliant film and a connection to the past cant tell you enough how wonderful it is to see a movie in a european setting with an entirely european cast
Jul 2 2022,positive,arthouse braveheart this is an excellent story and film for those looking for a visually artistic film with complex characters
Jul 1 2022,positive,took itself a lot more seriously than i wanted it to some kind of weird artistic washedout cross between 300 and vikings
Jul 1 2022,negative,dont waste your money on this unintelligible grotesque nightmare of a movie  no story no acting no sense
Jun 30 2022,negative,the plot the buildup and the dialog were lacking   had several artsy scenes just for the sake of having them they didnt push the plot forward   i hate movies that force a relationship to all the movie makers  you dont need a love story in every movie if they would have focused more on revenge and less of the filler it would have made a better movie
Jun 30 2022,negative,sooo slow long movie the trailer has all the action
Jun 29 2022,negative,wasnt my cup of tea the varying accents several inaccurate and many hard to  understand was really annoying the whole mysticism element made me feel like i was tripping on acid the cinematography was stellar ill give the movie that
Jun 29 2022,negative,just so bad too many good recent viking movies out there to accept this version horrible ending
Jun 29 2022,positive,there certainly are moments of the northman that are amazing it is beautifully made and obviously well crafted and told this is robert eggers after all however even despite a pretty interesting story twist it somehow remained painfully predictable and left very little to the imagination i wanted to like the northman way more than i did and all told i did enjoy it but i cant help but feel disappointed coming off eggers other work
Jun 29 2022,positive,this movie was wild and feral the ending was pretty epic and leaves you to wanting more a dark movie both literally and figuratively but i couldnt stop watching
Jun 29 2022,positive,loved it i wished i had seen it in the cinema but still a great watch on streaming
Jun 29 2022,positive,brilliant such an amazing film for alexander skarsgard the thrill of watching him be an absolute badass with the story of amleth and avenging his father definitely worth a watch
Jun 28 2022,negative,couldnt even finish it for free on peacock it is an extremely boring movie and a 2 hour rip off of the last kingdom
Jun 28 2022,positive,this movie was fucking awesome honestly i have barely any issues with the film apart from some pretty clunky exposition and foreshadowing and some underdeveloped characters but the positives of the film far outweigh the negatives
Jun 27 2022,negative,i enjoyed the imagery of the family tree in this movie  i also thought anya taylorjoy did a very good job  william dafoe was also perfect  the rest of the movie the story and the history were abysmal  all style no substance
Jun 27 2022,positive,soooset in the 800s it was quite savage after it was over brian told me its the origin story for hamlet which i think is the only reason i dont regret watching it but yes from a cinematography standpoint really well done
Jun 27 2022,positive,yeah this is better than cats
Jun 27 2022,positive,did i watch the literal coolest movie every put to film    probably    from the first scene i was on the edge of my seat i was fully enraptured and every scene after was like a dream so unreal that i couldnt believe i was witnessing it everything was framed exquisitely everything was written beautifully everything was filmed exceptionally    i cant write a longer review because there are not words to describe how wonderful this is watch this you are doing yourself a disservice to not do so shame on you if youre reading this and havent seen it already watch this now
Jun 27 2022,positive,definitely worth a watch
Jun 26 2022,negative,shakespeare references and all its plot is thinner than the conan movies hollow characters cheap metaphores the action scenes well probably in a viking saga kind of verosimility we could consider that as achieved
Jun 26 2022,negative,okay at best wasnt my cup of tea
Jun 26 2022,negative,brutally boring artsy dribble how many times can you redo hamlet
Jun 26 2022,neutral,its like the lion king except timon and pumbaa are both willem dafoes severed mummified head     i probably overhyped myself for this film and ended up very underwhelmed while the visuals have eggers typical eye for detail and earthy composition and the fight scenes feel wellchoreographed and authentic the northman seems to really suffer due to its script there is shockingly little meat on the bone in terms of moral conflict with few questions behind the motives or innocence of the antagonists or how skarsgårds amleth should deal with them including a hilariously sneering princecousin apart from one minor twist the general plot proceeds in a very traditional and conservative manner with little in the way of real suffering or opposition for our main character to build empathy or connection with the audience but the real aspect that ends up wearing on you is the dialogue and the inconsistent characterizations particularly from amleth a man supposedly living based off of a burning desire for revenge that has become a remorseless killing machine but who falls very quickly for a love interest and takes every opportunity possible to opt for the dramafilled cinematic take capped off by a mutual decision not to kill his sworn enemy immediately but instead to fight him in a volcano for reasons decisions like this really seem to take away from the grounded gritty design that eggers usually excels at but that could be just my own misguided expectations     i guess my problem with this film was that i was expecting characters that were willing to beat their foes to death with a sharp rock but instead they go on quests for special magic swords hoping for something that was a bit more bone tomahawk than conan the barbarian 255
Jun 25 2022,positive,this movie is superb its like a awesome heavy metal show i love it
Jun 25 2022,negative,the story tries to civilize the ethnic germanic peoples who lived as indigenous not so long ago in the middle of the year 1000 ad germanic ethnicity tribes still lived in indigenous hollows and produced nothing even after 600 years since the roman empire ceased to exist they spent their time destabilizing the peace between villages invading them to steal and kill but the story tries to present a romanticized image as if the germanic ethnic group were already superior to other peoples even living in the middle of the mud
Jun 25 2022,positive,this movie was pure heavy metal  it was a visual orgy of epic proportions  the fight scenes were something to behold and skarrsgaard was an animal
Jun 25 2022,positive,prepare yourself to be immersed in an ancient world
Jun 24 2022,positive,the atmosphere and attention to detail in this film is wild and really creates a world that seems lived in robert eggers and his team made something truly engrossing and i hope to see many more films by them
Jun 24 2022,negative,so difficult to watch
Jun 24 2022,negative,was expecting much more after seeing the preview
Jun 22 2022,positive,great movie solid gritty felt like what we need right now im the midst of the marveldisney overload trying to force people to have certain viewswell movies like this is a movie it leaves all the preaching for the preachers lol it is a movie thats made to entertain with a decent casting and good story nothing to fancy but good and i hope theres more originality etc and hope that theres more films like this and top gun mav and dune ambulancethe batmanalthough the sound editing was quiet lol and movies like that in the future and hope disneymarvel and kathleen kennedy may take a few notes and start making real cinema again just my opinion i like whats good and even whats not good i give every benefit of the doubt and try and find the pros in every film i just want to see cinema stay alive and its clear what the audience wants soo ya just keep watching all i know i love a good film and this was a good one
Jun 22 2022,positive,great story great acting great scenes i was locked to the screen and willing the main character on throughout a simple to follow story line with really interesting in depth scenes that i havent seen in other viking movies    seemed to combine both the realistic historical and fantastical viking elements really well     well worth watching
Jun 22 2022,positive,the northman pervaded my preconceptions as a straightforward revenge story mired in gratuitous violence and felt akin to an anthropological study thats not to say the movie is want for action theres berserking raids as is to be expected in a viking film ambushes assassinations and mano a mano swordfights what makes the northman stand apart are the portrayals of religious rituals  the first concerning amleth alexander skarsgard king aurvandill ethan hawke and heimer the fool willem dafoe is fantastic  prebattle chants funeral processions and the oftoverlooked superior ability of the vikings to take their ships deep into the european continent it is their shipbuilding and maneuvering abilities that brings them into the land of the rus russia where they raid a village and retrieve their plunder and slaves raider amleth and raided anya taylor joy makes for a unique meetcute unfortunately the film falls into the irksome language issue that so plagues many historical films none of these people scandinavians and slavs speak english and yet random bouts of both native languages spring up here and there  it especially got to me when amleth trying to passoff as a slav is speaking english to the other slavs instead of their language the twist is unexpected and jawdropping the final showdown honestly couldve been better while the setting was phenomenal onscreen it looked overly digitized which contrasted with the practical effects appeal of the rest of the movie the ending which is laptop homescreen fuel was great
Jun 22 2022,positive,a surreal violent and visually stunning epic 
Jun 22 2022,positive,dark gritty violent almost realistic its a barren brutal movie with great acting yet a story thats not really compelling similar to conan minus the charme
Jun 22 2022,negative,a rubbish movieand the language is so irritating they talk like a russian guy speaking english i dont know why those stupid writers of viking and this movie make the actors talk like that and then suddenly they talk the local languagevery stupid  as for the storyits hamlet rewritten stupidly
Jun 22 2022,negative,there is nothing redeeming about this movie the acting dialogue plot fight choreography visuals and premise are all beyond horrible roger corman aint got nothin on this trash
Jun 22 2022,positive,interesting try to make an original and non usual viking film it has some limitations and elements that not everyone might appreciate it is still a must see for people who love the vikings world
Jun 22 2022,positive,absolutely fantastic  stunning visuals and echoes the sagas in tone  the definitive viking film
Jun 21 2022,neutral,my son recommended this movie to me the lighting was way too dark in hue the movie played more like a history channel movie i did not enjoy it 
Jun 21 2022,negative,i cant be the only one to be blamed for hating this movie i found it disconnected boring lame and too dark and too long even the cast wasnt good for my taste
Jun 21 2022,positive,the northman is similar to other robert eggers films a very well executed artsy film lacking broad audience appeal i found that rewatching this film a second time significantly increased my enjoyment of it many of the subtle symbolism and foreshadowing elements became much clearer upon viewing again
Jun 21 2022,positive,i thought the movie was very good it was an epic revenge tale and the actors did a masterful job also i enjoyed the glimmers of lion king in the plot
Jun 21 2022,positive,it was ok  cant say ill watch it again storyline was good though
Jun 21 2022,negative,not sure why this movie has such a high rating it is the most boring and strange viking movie ive ever seen terrible dialogue hammy acting odd fantasy sequences and worst of all booooooooooring
Jun 21 2022,positive,78 felt like a good long episode of vikings similar vibe with the countryside and the ocean and the weird psychiatric dreams and prayer didnt care for those parts but the rest of the film was fun it was a little disappointing when we found out the mom didnt even love the dad and actually ask the uncle to kill him because it felt like his whole motivation was wasted but the subsequent fight sequences were cool would rewatch 610
Jun 21 2022,positive,great direction and attention to detail if you miss the violent classics of the 80s try to get time to see this one would love eggers to do a predator film set in the middle ages
Jun 20 2022,positive,it was good had some true viking facts to it  was fun to watch
Jun 20 2022,positive,in the landscape of predictable blockbusters i enjoyed this film it felt nuanced mystical and interwove cultural aspects of historical culture with a driving storyline
Jun 20 2022,positive,tldr gladiator  valhalla rising  x  arthouse  the northman  its important to frame the picture through the lens of robert eggers expect detail expect visual narrative expect to be challenged and to be rewarded this is a viking revenge story that picks up from the witch and isnt afraid to get a bit lighthouse you could say eggers sold out with this picture if you truly knew the man but this is a blistering presentation of the old way minus nicole kidmans obvious face lifts which glares from the period piece
Jun 20 2022,positive,theres a great artwork in the environment of this movie involving mithology culture and behaviour of ancient viking times however the plot shows a very twisted story o could not accept at all but the movie will be ok for any war movies lover
Jun 20 2022,negative,one of the absolute worst written acted and produced movies i have ever seen and boring despite the gratuitous violence and suffering  i had to stop watching it before it ended as it was making me sick  dont waste your time
Jun 20 2022,positive,my wife and i heard that this was ok or not that great  i think eggers is interesting though i hadnt really enjoyed any of his films thus far  the subject matter source material insistence on authenticity to the time and eggers cinematography made us watch this  ive read many of the sagas i am deeply interested in this era of history  this movie so obviously respects the source material and does so to a degree that i havent ever seen or at least cannot remember  this movie also went out of its way to be authentic to the time in a way that ive only ever seen in outlaw king although the clothing architecture etc was done greatly in the last duel they didnt respect the source material as much as the northman  furthermore its stunningly beautiful with a wonderful soundtrack the storytelling is done extremely efficiently with very little fat and what fat there was set the atmospheres flavor perfectly  in a time of politically infused movies and films unwilling to be fully invested in a vision for fear of not being for everyone  this movie stands out as truly and obsessively sincere    i made an account here specifically to give this as high a rating as i could it would be a sin if this didnt become a classic this movie is a masterpiece
Jun 20 2022,negative,i love every vikingthemed filmseries i had sooo much hope in the cast because of the names but all in all it was 25 hours from my life what i wasted on this film  i gave this 15 stars because of the cast otherwise it dereves less than 0 this was the worst viking movie ive ever seen
Jun 20 2022,positive,i really appreciated a more realistic portrayal of vikings for once  bleak harsh unforgiving   fanatical devotion to dark ages principles  the portrayal of throat singing and viking world viewreligion as well as berserkers  is kind of a first
Jun 20 2022,positive,64 of the audience currently622 have no idea how this film is a modern day masterpiece do not listen to others on here or anywhere for that matter sit down watch this movie and you tell me how many times you hold your breath and gaze deep into the tv robert e directed his best film to date and if you like moviestv similar to game of thrones arthur dune 1917 etc you will love it
Jun 20 2022,positive,i absolutely loved absolutely everything about the northman from the direction to the cinematography to the action production design pacing the acting everyone gives such primal performances they truly felt like they lived like these characters for the shoot skarsgård is the best ive ever seen him in a such visceral and physical performance then to go to the soft loving scenes with anya taylorjoy and their chemistry is the heart of the film with what little heart it has for being a revenge film like always anya taylorjoy lights up the screen when shes on it she truly a remarkable actor and talent one of the next big stars hawke in a small role like always is so damn good doing some very interesting work that he could only do in a robert eggers film hes one of the best actors working today the film is absolutely beautiful its seems naturally shot if it isnt then bravo because it looks it all the beautiful wide shots of the landscapes are breathtaking love seeing a big budget film actually be artful again be different and take some chances unfortunately it seems it didnt hit with the masses though its the best of its genre ive seen since ridley released the directors cut of kingdom of heaven eggers is a true auteur with every sense of the word you can tell its an eggers film from the opening shot he has such an interesting and unique style and i hope he keeps making his wonderfully weird historical shit because i love it
Jun 20 2022,negative,horrible movie and i love all things viking the plot was silly you cant understand the actors and the acting was laughable
Jun 19 2022,positive,great norse mythical epic brutal battles and trippy visions visually amazing epic landscapes and authentic sets all builds to an epic dual at the gates of hell what more could you want
Jun 19 2022,positive,ok but nothing special in terms of the actors selected  nice visuals though
Jun 19 2022,negative,random made no sense it was beautiful and had some historical accuracy plus the acting was good but no actual story it was like a child wrote the script
Jun 19 2022,negative,horrible just wtf strange scenes making no sense after an hour i had to turn it off just brutal
Jun 19 2022,positive,absolutely beautiful
Jun 19 2022,positive,gutsy and raw not at all what i expected going into a modern viking movie the northman reminds me of how powerful the medium of film can be when properly used as an artform and how abstract character development and associations can be its impossible to take anything in this film at face value as we are continuously being challenged on what we think to be true or to be untrue omens and prophecies abound its easy to consider the northman too fantastical for what it tries to convey which at its core is a tale of a man seeking revenge for murdered kin something thats been done time and again but this plotline is a branch to hold onto as were taken for a worthwhile ride through the tumultuous winds of amleths rage both inwards as he reflects on his fate and destiny and outwards as he carves through men women and children as if theyre just heaps of meat impeding on his perceived journey down the path of revenge i highly recommend watching this film if you enjoy spending the day after wondering what it all meant and if youre as appreciative of characterdriven stories as i am 910
Jun 19 2022,negative,terrible boring trippy useless  wouldnt spend a moment on it
Jun 19 2022,negative,it was not great its artistic and the landscapes are nice too long of a movie
Jun 19 2022,positive,filming was fantastic but i couldnt help but this this movie was misinterpreted from the trailer 10x slower of a movie
Jun 19 2022,negative,im a huge fan of the vikings series and the last kingdom but this film lacked most of what made the tv shows great too much esoteric mythology for me and the dialogue was too  ancient
Jun 18 2022,positive,good movie unexpected twist
Jun 18 2022,positive,this movie follows a viking amelth seeking revenge on his uncle after he killed his father and kidnapped his motherhe soon terrorizes his uncles village in a frightening way this movie is suspenseful and shows how dedicated the whole cast was the acting was great and the ending was everything i expected
Jun 18 2022,positive,note i found the vikings series quite average not a big fan of vikings movies or series usually but this one is incredible the story the visuals the violence must see
Jun 18 2022,neutral,2550 excellent production a good film but underwhelming viewing 
Jun 18 2022,negative,if you have time to waste before bed this is your film  boring as hell and youll be asleep before you know it 
Jun 18 2022,neutral,this could have been a phenomenal version of the tale of hamlet but despite some good moments and interesting cinematography its fatally marred by terrible accents ridiculous overacting by alexander skaarsgard and nicole kidman  both of whom are usually excellent  the inexplicable ability of people from different parts of northeastern europe to speak the exact same language at a time when people of different villages in the same country had a hard time understanding each other and twodimensional cardboard characters the 89 rating from critics is a mystery to me
Jun 17 2022,positive,great movie not predictable even though they tell you what will happen great acting 
Jun 17 2022,negative,disjointed  poor visual display no character development or storyline more like drug fueled artsy ode to vanity  plus what is with this trend of head hanging between rounded hunched shoulders alexander skarsgård idris elba  matt smith
Jun 17 2022,positive,awesome tale of before times with realistic actionsconsequences  story truly unfolds well and gives you a satisfying wrapup
Jun 17 2022,positive,this was probably my favorite version of the hamlet story even though it l has been told several times this is probably the best way its been done this film is exactly what the trailers promised a viking film dripping with blood sweat and copious amounts of brutality the real highlight of the film was the cinematography there is not a scene where the background doesnt look breathtaking as for the acting it was spectacular especially nicole kidman and alexander skarsgård but the accents werent the greatest for some of the actors the fights were just as brutal as one would hope for in a viking film about revenge after this film robert eggers is 3 for 3 having done the witch and the lighthouse previously he is proving himself to be one of the best directors of this generation if you loved eggers first two films then you will definitely love this one this was truly the definition of a cinematic epic
Jun 17 2022,positive,i can understand those that watch the movie and find it a bit too much but when you keep in mind all the culture beliefs and so on surrounding the movies themewell ill just say that it can give you something to remember 
Jun 16 2022,positive,the northman should be appreciated as art rather than that of a movie truly a masterpiece in its class
Jun 16 2022,negative,silly nonsense badly acted without subtlety evidently people then enjoyed a bizarre mixture of culture and overwhelming brutality and they had platinum blonde hair with black eyebrows
Jun 16 2022,positive,a bit slow but overall good revenge movie
Jun 16 2022,positive,i mean it is an epic in many ways looks interesting and im a history buff some good set pieces some beautiful shots throughout     but it is alot of big hairy men shoating and screaming at each other     all in all see it maybe just once if need be
Jun 16 2022,positive,these type of movies should be done more often they take us back to a simpler time in the movie industry when movies were actually made to be interesting and for you to think about what you just saw    the northman gives you that    its brutal its raw its physical its spiritual but above all its unapologetic its what it is and it doesnt ask forgiveness for being what it is so if you cant handle a view that is different from your own if you rant and whine about everything that doesnt fit your narrow view of the world then you can skip this movie because it isnt for you    this is a movie about how humans were and still are how we see reality through a very narrow lens but we think were seeing it all understanding it all    the main characters will show you that to perfection how their world is not necessarily the world rather its the world they can understand at the time the world they can see at the time but even as time progresses things shift change and even their grasp on reality can be tenuous at times leaving the viewer to wonder if something actually happened or was it some kind of vision    also the goals of the characters are simple they all want happiness in their lives they all want simpler lives they all think they know what they want but they all fall into fallacies that leads them astray    this movie does an example job showing how easy its to see your life through your own perspective and not care about looking at all sides and the price that comes with being so narrow minded    thats why although this movie is set in ancient norse times you can still look at the characters and see so much of what people are today    the northman in many ways its you me and everyone you meet or know the northman represents the core of our nature but also our ability to overcome it if we simply stop and think beyond our egos    some actors did a far better job than others    alexander skarsgård showed how much he has grown as an actor and easily carries the movie mostly by himself    anya taylorjoy did the best she could with what little time she was given helping to cement skarsgård character    as for nicole kidman ive seen far better from her and it didnt feel like she was into her character at all    even ethan hawke put little effort into it maybe because he just wanted to get his part done and move on to another project    this movie will take you on a simple journey because the goals are simple and even relatable and for those that can see beyond what theyre shown this movie will actually teach you something important    as a bonus this movie brings none of the agendas that most movies dont even try to hide anymore its a simple movie with characters that have simple goals and those goals will clash and fight    it will be for those that just watch it and dont think about it a simple movie it will be an immersive interesting and intriguing experience for those that watch it but think about what they watched    for those that will just watch it it will seem too long    for those that will watch it and think about what theyre watching it will be just the right amount of time necessary to see it but also understand it
Jun 16 2022,positive,it had its moments but felt like it was missing something i would recommend to watch see it but it was a 1  done for me
Jun 16 2022,positive,visually gripping a classic plot set against an expansive landscape with perfect cinematography editing and sound dont sleep on this one
Jun 16 2022,positive,was actually disappointed in this visually appealing but i didnt take any emotions away after
Jun 15 2022,positive,excellent film has a different feel than most viking flicks the acting and script writing is great i have a feeling this one will fly under the radar of a lot of folks but this was a very enjoyable movie to watch
Jun 15 2022,negative,this was one of the most idiotic senseless utter bull crap ive ever seen do not watch this movie just dont watch vikings series instead that was almost perfect this was 100 crap
Jun 15 2022,positive,it was a great movie i just didnt like the end
Jun 15 2022,positive,loved it wish i could have seen it in the movie theater my fiancé said it was going to be garbage but i knew better
Jun 15 2022,positive,the movie might be misleading for some viewers but the northman is a breathtaking revenge epic thats focused more on folklore than action
Jun 15 2022,positive,gritty authentic viking film  exemplary of what you want to see for this genre i watched this with a horn of mead
Jun 15 2022,negative,its gross just a bunch of dudes yelling at each other
Jun 14 2022,positive,a true nordic viking epic if you like vikings or revenge movies will become a rewatchable
Jun 14 2022,negative,a litle stranger the movie i dont know i spected more action
Jun 14 2022,positive,not a fan of viking movies but this one was really good    very good acting beautiful filming locations and the imagery was well done
Jun 14 2022,positive,interesting movie was not bad at all and the main actor did a great job its a vengeance type of movie with gore scenes so if you like violence you will like it
Jun 14 2022,negative,slow progress disjoint and a story thats been told over and over if youve seen or read anything on that time and people youll know the outcome within minutes of the movie starting only saving grace is some of the scenery but thats the only reason not to give this 0 stars
Jun 14 2022,positive,exquisite revenge film in vein of conan the barbarian great acting wellpaced brutal 
Jun 14 2022,positive,movies like this dont come around too often and the box office receipt shows why its unfortunate that the public prefers formulaic to original fiction
Jun 14 2022,positive,went into it expecting an oldschool style of story telling and i was not disappointed  i believe it would work well as a stageplay but as a movie the added effects give it a bit of a bump up for me classic revenge story and a look into the old and misunderstood culture of the viking people
Jun 13 2022,negative,im in the minority but i really didnt enjoy this perhaps it was having it described as this generations gladiator which is an insult to that film for me the story is weak and didnt have any real heart to it i just didnt care about anyone in it sure a lot of the visuals are great but that doesnt make up for a weak story for me
Jun 13 2022,positive,this movie was a bit brutal i was invested in the story and what happens to the main character it went there in some instances incest betrayal nudity decapitations witchcraft not everyones cup of tea but someone out there will enjoy it
Jun 13 2022,negative,booring dull and witlesstoo much hocus pocus and pointless mysticismmovie couldnt decide if it was to be taken seriously or as a campy romp  conan the barbarian was much more entertaining and memorable  the only interesting character was the blond and she got too little screen time to help  the threadbare plot was not helped by blatant errorsamong others the king was shot by arrows but none of the attackers had bowshummmmmmskip this dog and rewatch conan
Jun 13 2022,positive,had a great time awesome movie with enough action violence and weirdness to keep it interesting probably will be a lovehate film for most moviegoers but i got exactly what i was expecting
Jun 13 2022,positive,an outstanding movie brilliant cinematography fantastic acting beautiful locations ans the writing of dialogue and the classic heros journey structure highly recommend
Jun 13 2022,positive,i love movies like this love to see a story unfold and as a fan and student of norse history mythology and technology it was great to see something so faithful this was a love letter to old silent movies this movie wasnt silent but and old fashin revenge movies
Jun 13 2022,negative,i have been struggling to find movies enjoyable in this day and age  this was a movie that looked to be breaking the mold and doing something different than what the hollywood machine has been pumping out  i was genuinely excited to see this movie and afterwards was so angry that i spent 20 to purchase it  this movie had so much potential and was just garbage  the sound was great the acting was great the setup was great and then it just went to hell  the only twist in the movie was so foreseeable that i saw called it out within the first 2 to 3 minutes  the first 10 minutes are a good setup then the rest of the movie just drags with really no build up except the voice in your own head saying this will pay off with an epic final fight  then the end comes and it just pisses you off even more  this is pure game of thrones season 8 writing  save your money on this one go watch top gun 2  if you already saw it go watch it again
Jun 13 2022,negative,first time in my life that i had to walk out of a movie absolute garbage so disappointed the story was incoherent and just plain weird 
Jun 13 2022,positive,wonderful production  gorgeous to watch stellar cast an ambitious take on magical realism alas the character development was rushed and i just didnt care much about any of them or what they were up to some of the most epic scenes looked like something out of an amon amarth video i think the actors had more fun than we did thanks for trying but in a world that already has the vikings tv series the northman fell flat for me bjork was excellent
Jun 13 2022,negative,i really like viking movies but this onewas bad
Jun 13 2022,negative,just not good the story is ok but just too much bs just falls short the movie has too many disconnected poetions
Jun 12 2022,positive,has a great story very good writers they are excellent vikings lol
Jun 12 2022,negative,thor should have struck this one down    for genuine fans of norse mythology this is simply a blood fest think mma fighting with viking costumes beware of anyone who says you must see this film perhaps one needs to be a devotee of robert eggers i am not and probably never will be after seeing this
Jun 12 2022,negative,worst and weirdest movie ive ever seen in my life
Jun 12 2022,positive,excellent  viking story with reasonable attention to detail and good acting all around bloody and entertaining   with a shakespeare plot 
Jun 12 2022,negative,incomprehensible babble trying to be deep symbolism  blah
Jun 12 2022,positive,great story well filmed good setting flying in the face of the hollywood vikings of the last decade this gives us an attempt to be closer to the reality of european vikings
Jun 12 2022,positive,the northman is hamlet told from the prospective of a blood thirsty viking and it was just as awesome as it sounds 5 out of 5 stars 
Jun 12 2022,negative,what all this was long could not hold attention then nothing he dies  not that interesting 
Jun 12 2022,neutral,a bit too long and drawn out for my taste
Jun 12 2022,negative,the characters seemed like they had no depth and the storyline didnt feel very well thought out either
Jun 12 2022,positive,great cinematography and acting many scenes are onyric with a great and powerful visual shot outstanding viking references
Jun 12 2022,positive,was a little slow and then the build up was meh
Jun 11 2022,negative,by far one of the worst films ive ever seen this was the nordic version of the new world with colin farrell that was equally as terrible the director went too far down the path of making an artsy film with lsdinduced visions of king trees and floating bodies but not enough attention to real character development or interesting fight scenes if you want a couple of hours of boring nonsense that youll never get back the northman is your film
Jun 11 2022,positive,it was a good movie the action was good and the cast was brilliant also the story was good and its worth seeing
Jun 11 2022,positive,i was hoping for an action movie but ended up being a horror movie disguised as a viking epic the entire movie sets up the horror shots at the end underwhelming
Jun 11 2022,positive,a great revenge story i have not since gladiator with some added hallucinations instead of dreams by the main character if youre a fan of norse mythology you will like this
Jun 11 2022,positive, recommend   great visuals       simple revenge story with really great imagery    great atmosphere and acting    nicole kidmans looks are a little out of place for the era but her performance is good    same director as the witch and the lighthouse now with a much bigger budget   if you liked either of those you will like it   if you hated those you should probably skip it
Jun 11 2022,positive,great adaptation of amleth showed on the screen  mysticism themes and sequences run within the telling bjork as a norn was cool too
Jun 11 2022,positive,entertaining enough but just okay while the production value was very good i found the story very weak and predictable and a total underutilization of the lead acting talent
Jun 11 2022,positive,i strongly doubt the northman is anywhere near as historically accurate as director robert eggers insists but that hardly matters here as this epic tale unfolds with brilliant if at times bombastic turns by all the key players involved
Jun 11 2022,positive,a hamlet remake that i thought was done well but still hamlet need more originality nowadays instead of the same stories over and over
Jun 11 2022,positive,this movie really does a fantastic job explaining its intent i think the questions you should ask yourself after watching are presented early on its also beautifully shot and has some amazing imagery
Jun 11 2022,positive,i rate this movie alot at first i thought it was going to be kinda boring but it actually turned out to be one of the most interesting films i have watched  specially based on the historic view of vikings and their actual brutality even to the costumes and songs very accurate in my opinion
Jun 10 2022,positive,thoroughly enjoyed the movie  skarsgard did a great job in the role  was a great mixture of the mystical into the norse mythology  not an overly action filled movie but the action scenes are done well  the fight scenes are very visceral  highly recommend
Jun 10 2022,neutral,robert eggers has certainly proven his brilliance as an auteur as demonstrated by his first two immaculate works he has shown a unique capacity for tapping into that nether region between imagination and insanity as a means of unleashing truly primal feelings of indescribable dread and foreboding it is therefore unfortunate that the northman fails precisely where his previous efforts have succeeded in an effort to stun us with an outrageously savage depiction of mystical tribal fervor he produces instead an endless series of displays of howling growling oilymuscled men at the expense of potentially more compelling character dynamics in truth this renders the mesmerizing atmospheric qualities of the film ironically disappointing we want the story to display a degree of inspiration concurrent with the brilliantly evocative cinematography and equally impactful music score bold esoteric sequences roll out before us and they offer intimations of the greatness that the northman could potentially have achieved with the right attention to character and story development yet for all of the films uninhibited ambition the viewing experience becomes remarkably monotonous and we quickly find ourselves lamenting what might have been when all is said and done the northman strikes me as one of the most aesthetically appealing failures that ive seen in a long time the inherent tragedy of which is the inevitable failure of the viewer to take the film half as seriously as it quite obviously wants to be taken
Jun 10 2022,negative,really nothing special here nothing grand or cinematic boring plot subpar story and average effects this was really just a sad waste of time
Jun 10 2022,negative,definitely doesnt deserve anything above 2 stars one of the very few movies where i wanted to walk out in the first 15 mins the writing of the movie was just horrible 2 star movie for me
Jun 10 2022,positive,amazing movie in therms of visual effects and photography the story could be a little floppy but probably really good movie if you are into vikings
Jun 10 2022,positive,its great to see the raw scene and stories without any filter of current society to portray of past
Jun 10 2022,negative,awful not worth the time save yourself and avoid this movie
Jun 10 2022,positive,style over substance definitely worth a watch for its special effects and cinematography but try not to pay too much attention to the plot or script
Jun 10 2022,positive,really wanted to like this film but too many times was unintelligible     if only i knew ancient nordic languages that would help but i felt that too many scenes were jumping boards for sex nudity overthetop violence and gore
Jun 10 2022,neutral,massively overhyped the scenerysetting is by far the best thing about this film also really nice cameo from bjork but thats about the only good thing i can say its not an awful film just not that good
Jun 10 2022,positive,motivational and inspiring
Jun 10 2022,positive,very good enthralling weird at times but they pulled it off
Jun 10 2022,neutral,i really wanted to love this i did  but turns out im not a fan it had a great cast but it was so long  boring  why did nicole kidman look dead the entire time i enjoyed the action  dead body scenes but i did not enjoy the storyrest of it sounds like maybe this was a play or some folklore or something so maybe if youre familiar with the story already youll enjoy it but i wouldnt recommend otherwise
Jun 9 2022,negative,a poor attempt at capitalizing on the success of vikings and the last kingdom both of which i enjoyed  i could only get through 20 minutes of the film before i decided not to waste any more of my time on it
Jun 9 2022,negative,its bad movie there are good actors in the film but they hardly got a chance to act  avenge my fathers murder without a plot beyond avenge bad script they did the best with what they had in theory 
Jun 9 2022,positive,a straightforward revenge story with visually immersive cinematography but the dull climax and underwhelming action sequences were a letdown
Jun 9 2022,positive,hamlet conan with striking visuals a movie that shows you and doesnt tell you and  as a result gives you a lot to think about    some slight distractions but more than worth a big screen
Jun 9 2022,positive,this movie is a faithful retelling of the icelandic saga that got turned into macbeth and inspired game of thrones if you havent read any of the icelandic sagas prepare yourself for a shock this is a different world view mercy is seen as weakness and killing somebody can be seen as a favor this story is not as simple as it appears and the movie can be hard to watch  nobody in this movie is the good guy or the bad guy
Jun 9 2022,positive,great film and unsually filmed which i liked
Jun 9 2022,positive,brilliant modern conan
Jun 9 2022,positive,another strong addition from robert eggers this film wont be for everyone but it sure has been made with a lot of effort attention to detail and that shows in every scene great performances by alexander skarsgard in the lead role anna taylor joy too has done quite well
Jun 9 2022,positive,a movie that took me back in time to a brutal era 5 stars
Jun 9 2022,positive,saw this in theatre wow gorgeous and so badass
Jun 9 2022,positive,a perfect or near perfect film wickedly beautiful eggers is brilliant see it on the big screen
Jun 9 2022,negative,this movie was beautifully directed and the scenery effects are gorgeous but the story line falls flat theres just not enough character development also the story line is slow and in some spots boring the characters are all one dimensional and it just doesnt work
Jun 9 2022,negative,a revenge movie of the worst kind it is only about revenge
Jun 8 2022,negative,no character development really arthouse and weird  not very entertaining overacted and nicole kidmans plastic unmoving face is disturbing
Jun 8 2022,positive,an epic and atmospheric tale of blood and sacrifices   strong scenes which are not for the fainthearted  great strong performances epically beautifully shot
Jun 8 2022,neutral,the beginning with the young amleth was bad with cringeworthy dialogue  acting but it gets better although it never becomes a good film
Jun 8 2022,positive,the northman  the story of a viking and a tale of revenge  at the beginning of the story the character of ethan hawke playing the role of king and his bond with his family is captured after certain turn of events the revenge drama thriller starts    the son of the viking king is on hunt to kill the man who betrayed and killed his father and captured his mother growing with the vikings and learning their fierceful ways and getting stronger and how he takes the revenge is the story    the story is quite simple but yet made in a fantastic way which make us thrilled till the end the cinematography is just amazing and pleases our eyes costumes and set design is something to talk about it is flawless and beautifully carried out the whole part of the movie was building for the final act  there are certain twist and turns but i think it is quite guessable but there are other many things that is well executed the script is tight the performances were great by every actor in this movie   the best thing about this movie is its sound design and music its really some god level stuff going there i loved it so much
Jun 8 2022,positive,the action felt a little slow at times and the realism varies from scene to scene but overall its a solid movie with amazing visuals
Jun 8 2022,negative,what a total waste of time
Jun 8 2022,positive,great art  great popcorn movie simultaneously
Jun 8 2022,negative,just to counter one of the fake five star reviews here 
Jun 8 2022,negative,i had been looking forward to this unfortunately i was very disappointed so much was wrong with this movie that its not worth the discussion 
Jun 8 2022,negative,i expected more from the movie the beginning got me really excited half to the end it sucked
Jun 7 2022,positive,a big fan of the vikings tv series i think this movie suffers from an overdose of mysticism
Jun 7 2022,positive,the northman is an excellent interpretation of a timeless story the cinematography is great with sweeping long shots of a beautiful set the fact that most of the film was shot on site really shines through the acting is great all around as you would expect from this cast and the film seems to be truly dedicated to viking authenticity the overall tone and plot of the movie is quite gritty and bloody but to a certain extent the film also allows you to take it as seriously as you like something i personally really liked was how the film showed things like gods valkyries seers and the undead as existing without veering into fantasy allowing the world to be as the characters would have seen it   an excellent and rather bloody tale of vengeance   95100
Jun 7 2022,negative,though it has a very ambitious script it falls surprisingly flat with the dialogue and directing visually it hits the mark but the acting is less than compelling and the story often meanders into unnecessary tangents from the plot     there are better revenge movies and most definitely better shows about vikings
Jun 7 2022,positive,i found the movie quite entertaining and was blown away by the authenticity of the period i especially liked the way the story is told in the eyes of a young boy and how simple he sees the world and how he sees his parents  idolizing his father as we young boys donever knowing that even our parent are capable of mistakes
Jun 7 2022,positive,gritty highstakes unrelenting in its narrative and knows what kind of story it wants to tell  i highly respect how they portrayed the characters to be as true to the era as possible in a modern movie
Jun 7 2022,positive,a visceral violent vignette of viking vengeance thats sure to entertain    check out the full review at 
Jun 7 2022,positive,a very good movie and historically accurate
Jun 7 2022,positive,i absolutely loved this film its such a rarity to see a film with such commitment to the subject matter and an eye for historical detail at this point i will watch anything eggers makes and add it to my personal library as well
Jun 7 2022,negative,acting is ok but the story is very predictable after 10 min as is the ending the attempts to show cultural aspects of different groups is too lengthy and ruins the pacing an unsuccessful attempt at an ostentatious remake of hrafninn flýgur
Jun 7 2022,negative,choppy weird plot way too much gore for no reason and unnecessary nudity i wish i lived in viking times so i didnt have to endure the suffering of having to watch this film
Jun 6 2022,negative,dialogue was horrible  plot was inane and predictable  stilted acting  really a very bad movie
Jun 6 2022,negative,its all cinematic aesthetics wrapped around a simplistic revenge narrative  think of it as hamlet the viking
Jun 6 2022,negative,its just very disappointing  acting worthy of any community theater  cinematography and scripting worthy of any freshman film student with all due respect sarsgaard is the wrong actor for this role and eggers is the wrong director  badly needed to be rethought prior to production
Jun 6 2022,negative,unnecessary gore to long story poor
Jun 6 2022,positive,similar to mel gibsons apocalypto in its brutality and superb action sequences but also very much shakespearean in its fatalistic narrative and poetic dialogue the northman is another robert eggers masterpiece and a further proof that he is one of the best directors we have right now although overly violent the film is to be respected for its staggering attention to detail in recreating this time period   the costumes sets cinematography and editing are all marvelous it is a truly epic artistic transportive piece of genrebending filmmaking that finally depicts vikings realistically instead of romanticizing them eggers really is a period piece auteur
Jun 6 2022,positive,the northman is stunning with its great cinematography beautiful location score and amazing performances by all the cast  the story is alittle basic but serviceable
Jun 6 2022,positive,i expected a better move with scarsgaurd in it felt cheap and rushed
Jun 6 2022,positive,from the beginning this movie strikes into your soul and never lets go     best film i have ever seen
Jun 6 2022,positive,the movie promised a lot and delivered under that expectation by being too bound to the adaptation of shakespeare if it went its own direction story wise it would have been much better
Jun 6 2022,positive,breath of fresh air 
Jun 6 2022,negative,i disliked the tone and setting it felt like it was really reaching for some type artistic flair and failed after watching several shows about vikings this was disappointment
Jun 6 2022,positive,it was a fun movie and really great if you are into the swordfantasy bit
Jun 6 2022,positive,i really love viking movies i understand the pillage and killing but this  film unnecessarily spends too much time on the violence i wasnt satisfied with the ending unfortunately chances for a sequel are laid to rest with a lengthy sword battle ending
Jun 6 2022,positive,a great entertaining movie based on a scandinavian folktale not your normal hollywood fare there is a hidden connection to hamlet making the movie even better
Jun 5 2022,positive,it is what it is its not for the eternal complainers
Jun 5 2022,negative,cmon  this was terrible
Jun 5 2022,negative,the northman cost me two plus hours of my life that i will never get back  the characters and dialogue were not compelling the plot did flow consistently the film should have ended 30 minutes earlier if you like viking movies i would recommend you find something else to watch
Jun 5 2022,negative,trailer cheats you into thinking it has anything to do with the typical vyking stories that you would like dont go see this movie its the biggest disappointment of the year
Jun 5 2022,positive,weird but not in a good way 
Jun 5 2022,negative,had to turn it off it got so bad creepy and gross and it doesnt get better
Jun 5 2022,negative,this movie was horrendous  i was so looking forward to it after being a fan of vikings show and last kingdom on netflix  this was such a let down
Jun 5 2022,negative,how can a viking revenge story be so utterly boring and lacking in excitement it was downright weird storytelling at times the pacing was lackluster and the characters were not compelling give me some last kingdom instead
Jun 5 2022,negative,this is an awful movie  i love viking movies but this isnt very good
Jun 5 2022,positive,the northman is first of all an insane experience  i was very hyped for this movie in specific because it is after all a robert eggers film though i must say i expected something a little different the movie is a viking story based on the sagas but its not an ordinary viking story that you would probably see on a show like the last kingdom or netflixs vikings it focusses on different aspects of nordic culture and the violence oh man the violence this film is fucking brutal visceral  with that said the word that really defines this film is unique eggers is able to tell a story in such an odd way that no other director would have thought about doing so tho the message the director transmits in other movies of his such as the witch or the lighthouse is harder to catch if there is a message on the northman after all i really did not see it i came out of the movie thinking about what eggers was trying to say with the film i really didnt come up with anything what doesnt makes the movie bad its just unexpected  not gonna lie got a little disappointed with some actors that are known at the eggerss movies such as anya taylorjoy and willem dafoe anya gets a lot of screentime but dafoe nails when he appears and he is on the screen for like 4 minutes claes bang an unknown actor for me destroys as fjölnir both him and skarsgård are able to make the final fight a fucking show an event such an epic battle  in conclusion i was very hyped for a philosophical journey with my man robert eggers which i didnt get but the movie is still amazing so incredible i screamed at every single kill that amleth had taken its so epic
Jun 5 2022,positive,phenomenal work of art
Jun 5 2022,positive,great movie absolutely loved it sound effects were a bit too loud maybe lowering the movie a bit would help
Jun 4 2022,positive,kind of a mixed bag i knew this was based off the story that inspired hamlet so i got the plot easy enough much more mythical stuff than i was expecting and also some less than clear plot points like him retrieving the sword not sure what i was suppose to take from that scene over all good movie it wasnt meant to be a morality piece the main character did seem to have a moment of clarity towards the end he was basically driven by revenge it is a very pretty movie lots of fantastic cinematography if you go into thinking its some epic its not bravehart more conan with a mix of hamlet
Jun 4 2022,negative,slow paced plot didnt appear to have a point  dark and hero not really a good guy  and my friend said it sucked
Jun 4 2022,positive,a brilliant movie with great attention to detail a tru epic that is masterfully shot its gripping and full of atmosphere easily the best movie ive seen this year
Jun 4 2022,positive,good movie if maybe a little too abstract  kidmans a bit of a distraction but if you like vikings and men yelling at each other then this ones for you  good performances although it did drag a tiny bit
Jun 4 2022,positive,great visuals in a different kind of epic action
Jun 4 2022,negative,i will never trust the paid  cheap movie critics anymore  the movie is almost good the plots looked good from the beginning to the third outstanding talented stars and performances but unexpected and non sense twisted just failure to deliver a cinematic masterpiece at the end
Jun 4 2022,positive,fantastic movie that is visually stunning and thrilling
Jun 4 2022,negative,yes the cinematography is exceptional  however that is all this movie has to offer  the plot is simplistic to say the least  there are long stretches where darkness reigns nothing is said and nothing is accomplished  there is very little character development other than the revenge motif  the plot is plodding and predictable  it is the prototypical viking revenge tale with no surprises  quite frankly boring
Jun 4 2022,neutral,i felt like i was watching a parody not a very interesting story overdone viking stereotypes gratuitous violence a very immature film
Jun 4 2022,positive,amazing movie from both a visual historical and story perspective
Jun 3 2022,negative,predictive poor texts cant believe i so it through   just go see vikings series its in all aspects way times better
Jun 3 2022,positive,norse mythology gotesque action vengeance movie made well
Jun 3 2022,negative,wow what a bad movie
Jun 3 2022,positive,this movie is for 2 types of movie watchers somebody who wants some crazy hardcore viking fights and somebody who wants a creative and artfully shot historical epic
Jun 3 2022,positive,awesome great movie
Jun 3 2022,positive,a cathartically terrific movie after an endless stream of plastic hollow corporate marvell flicks the northman is a jolt of authenticity this film is guided by one purpose the immerse the viewer in the viking world as it actually was not as how it can be contrived for a modern progressive audience the dark and foreboding ambiance is particularly good some unexpected plot twists but done in a digestible way great acting and best of all an accurate depiction of viking culture and religion
Jun 3 2022,negative,this movie was an incoherent fever dream  wannabe artsy cringeworthy and boring what can you expect from a movie that starts with a young boy farting and burping in unison with his father
Jun 3 2022,positive,robert eggers delivers the most brutal epic viking movie to date
Jun 3 2022,negative,how stupid are the critics why do i always ask rhetorical questions how dumb is this movie there i go again way too long boring with no center just a bunch of people who are going to kill each other and then have a big party in valhalla where theyll be slamming their flagons together and rejoicing about how badass they were when they were killing each other and where all will be forgiven reminds me of another stinker alexander but not quite as bad extremely faint praise
Jun 3 2022,positive,eggers does it again the northman is a masterclass in period film making with a twist great artistic expression is mixed with the gritty realness of the viking time period this is not a typical action revenge movie and its better for it but some viewers may be confused if they expect bog standard action
Jun 3 2022,positive,it was not what i thought it was going to be and was pleasantly surprised  i enjoyed how it went into some of the viking lore  also it was nice to see the main character was not just a warrior but someone with intelligence
Jun 3 2022,positive,story of a son avenging his family with a twist
Jun 2 2022,positive,great movie i will be buying it when it comes to bluray
Jun 2 2022,positive,i expected to be bored but it was entertaining some odd parts different than your typical vikings movie
Jun 2 2022,negative,truly dreadful not one original idea acting and accents so bad they are laughable so artsy that it forgets to be enjoyable gory and violent with music that makes you want to cut your own head off to avoid hearing it a waste of fine acting talent this remake has jumped on the bandwagon of historical fantasy trying to cover up its lack of originality with bloodier fights and utterly meaningless imagery succeeding only in punching below the weight of its predecessor
Jun 2 2022,positive,a dark eerie tragedy that entertwines the religious iconography of norse legend with unfettered brutality of viking living stunning visuals suspense and a heartbreaking tragic hero
Jun 2 2022,positive,good movie i recommend to watch it is entertaining and containing a lot of action and mythology
Jun 2 2022,positive,what do you want in northman  vikingsplenty of vikings  we got that
Jun 2 2022,negative,if i save anyone from wasting 2 hours on this crap i have done my job   have no idea what critic see in this movie stay away
Jun 2 2022,positive,this movie is a cinematic masterpiece  it is difficult to say what is best about this work  the story is very simple but it doesnt stop being deep and having important layers the photography is wonderful the costumes and the setting are impeccable the performances are magnificent without a doubt it is one of the best films of the year
Jun 2 2022,negative,absolutely bereft of any intellectual content guys with six packs wielding axes  absolute mindless guff the writer relies on so called shocking scenes of a headless man  this is a poor mans vikings series in film form  loads of stereotypical soothsaying mumbojumbo and long greasy hair and you have one lazyass film thats been done a million times 
Jun 2 2022,negative,absolutely terrible went in with high hopes left bemused and baffled that a production company and a director said this is a good movie its that bad
Jun 2 2022,positive,visually stunning but extremely violent
Jun 2 2022,negative,another pointless terrible movie from hollywood im sure the critics will think this is great with a twist and pretty much all characters dieting at the end simply thelma and louise in viking garb ending
Jun 1 2022,positive,all around a very entertaining movie if you have an appreciation for norse mythology and scandinavian history youll probably appreciate the northman i definitely enjoyed how the mythological  spiritual motives were woven into the characters arcs 
Jun 1 2022,positive,i was waiting for a very long time for this movie to come out i am huge eggers fan and loved the vvitch and the lighthouse two classics that i will always go back to again and again this was a little bit of a miss for me i felt like it was slightly forced as if i was watching a play at a theater rather than a movie maybe that was the intent
Jun 1 2022,positive,while not for everyone robert eggers viking epic is a bloody gorgeously shot tale of revenge that will surely later become a masterpiece
Jun 1 2022,positive,consider writerdirector robert eggers bloody viking revenge movie as a companion piece to 2021s the green knight both movies take mythical supernaturalaided tales of heroics and medieval masculinity and feed into the spectacle while also cleaving the legend to make way for a sense of humanity we follow amleth alexander skatsgard who is a displaced prince who has sworn to kill his treacherous uncle and rescue his mother nicole kidman its a tale so old that it inspired shakespeares hamlet though that play could have benefited from a climax involving two hulking naked men dueling to the death atop an exploding volcano the northman reminds me a lot of mel gibsons apocalypto a movie i described back in the day as an art film for jocks its immersive and impressive down to the exact detail and it doesnt shirk on the blood and combat its also unmistakably the work of eggers a very precise and idiosyncratic indie director whose prior movies felt like stylistic dares the camerawork is often long with single takes making all the visual arrangements and coordination that much more impressive its staggering that a studio provided eggers with 90 million to go make his version of conan the barbarian at a lugubrious 140 minutes theres enough sticky carnage to satiate fans of brutish medieval action movies but i appreciated how eggers keeps his story purposely streamlined and simplistic until a few keen reveals force the audience and protagonist to reexamine the assumptions and fleeting honor of vengeance in this harsh unfair environment of men outkilling one another its a movie that provides the red meat and then makes you question whether you might want to go vegan theres more that can be unpacked but i wish eggers had cut back at points this is a slow movie which does contribute to its mood and atmosphere but i also wish eggers had gotten to some of his plot points with a bit more haste and vigor the northman is transporting and bold and also more than a bit bloated you could laugh at some of its overthetop machismo but i feel like eggers is inviting criticism of that very machismo so enjoy the movie on one level where it indulges all the old world violence and then enjoy it on another level where it subverts and castigates the same old world violence or you could just watch for the glistening muscles famous faces bad accents bad wigs guttural score and weird imagery    nates grade b
Jun 1 2022,positive,so what stopped me giving this 5 stars    for me i loved everything about this film but without spoiling it i did not want ambiguity i wanted more fantasy i wanted a genuine scandinavian tale of myths    the directing the pace everything else is awesome
Jun 1 2022,positive,i like the movie and the how it was filmed i also like the detail and how the history was mixed with the lore and mythology but im also a film nerd most of the audience will not get that and thats sad
Jun 1 2022,positive,introduction  the northman was a film that i had mediumlevel expectations for and although at times i felt that it could meet those expectations the film continuously fell flat the cast was packed with stars that honestly didnt mesh well with me but also wasnt hindered due to the names involved helmed by alexander skarsgård in the leading role of amleth the pacing began quite wonderfully with the tale of revenge being centerfold throughout the film after the slaying of ethan hawkes character king aurvandill i wish however that the pacing stayed relatively the same throughout the runtime of this film as we quickly go between time skips to showcase travel and climactic moments in the story ruining what could have been a fantastic tale showing the vengeance sought by that of a man who has only known one thought his entire life    leading roles  there were some heavy hitters in this film for sure the skarsgård family is full of talent and this is yet again true for alexander in another role where i feel he did a great job of showcasing not only the character but the poor writing of said character many times throughout the film he felt almost flat which like many things in this film was explained by a narrative device this choice to limit range and depth did nothing to aid in the quality of the film whatsoever outside of skarsgård the other performances were incredibly hit or miss king fjölnir was honestly one of the better castings claes bang showcases a tremendous amount of range in emotion yet felt misdirected towards the latter end of the film bangs emotion begins to feel molded by the plot rather than by logic which in the situation threw me as a viewer olga portrayed by anya taylorjoy was decent as she tried to forward plans set by amleth throughout the film thus becoming his love interest which for me felt rather underwhelming there wasnt much chemistry and this was even more so made questionable by the somewhat incestuous undertones between amleth and his mother leading me to judge the blossoming relationship as that of an ironical statement that he was repeating his fathers life choices by taking on olga as his partner nicole kidman portrays queen gudrún amleths mother where she puts on a very overthetop and slightly confusing performance her character is obviously meant to be that of a deranged person with a cold heart but often the emotional weight of that pairing is let down by her exaggerated personality and tone of voice outside of these few roles not many are given the screen time to be noteworthy in my opinion    pacing  time skips big cuts and interesting cinematography choices gave way to what i feel is one of the weaker aspects of this film starting from the point of amleth as a child where we see the love for his father king aurvandill is strong this bond is quickly severed all pun intended after the king is beheaded by his own brother fjölnir whom of which assumes the throne for some time amleth goes on the run where he is soon after adopted by another group of vikings and raised to be a strong fighter we jump immediately to his adulthood where after a raiding scene he is reminded of his oath of revenge and thus begins his journey to find and kill his uncle to not spoil the film for those whove yet to watch we are taken on a convoluted journey that allows for only periodical time shots during the night which bogs down the beautiful greens and blues from the scenery in which filming took place this focus on nighttime although explained isnt as fulfilling of a plot device as it is intended to be the final thirty minutes of the film were quite cluttered with shifting motives which i assume were meant to be shocking or heavily weighted on the character but felt more like an emotionless brick the ending of the film wasnt bad per se but it did leave much more to desire from such a largely hyped movie    overall thoughts      this was a movie i really wanted to enjoy but felt that it could have done far more to grow the characters i dont think the acting was much of a problem but more so the script which tries to be far too convoluted than what the runtime allows for if youre into the viking genre and want a decent film to view you may like this one dont expect a ton in terms of narrative as the film sets its eyes on the spiritualreligious ideals that are setup early on in the movie had this part of the movie been done better i honestly think i may have enjoyed it more but due to that and the often bad writing i give it the rating of 35
Jun 1 2022,positive,superb the cinematography was just amazing acting was astonishing lost the track of time watching this at the theater wouldve been marvelous 
Jun 1 2022,negative,i went into this movie with my fingers crossed  unfortunately there wasnt a single thing i found interesting about this film  the acting was off and the story line wasnt good
May 31 2022,negative,boring slow silly  no story worthy of the name  no action worth seeing  just an awful movie
May 31 2022,positive,so great i loved it at the movies twice and already own it digitally
May 31 2022,positive,wow uniquely and amazing moviethis movie is purely art with a strong performances specially by skarsgårdtaylorjoykidman and hawke with astonishing cinematographydirection and score
May 31 2022,positive,good movie great acting editing sound film plot etc it is violent so not for kids but if you want something to pass the time its worth the price of a ticket
May 31 2022,negative,the rt on this movie really makes me question trusting them anymore this script could have been written by a high school drama class just so stupid it was amazing if you want a decent viking movie the last kingdom leaves this piece of residue in the dust
May 31 2022,positive,the northman masterfully paves his way to valhalla    the northman takes your breath away in a brutal and epic way    the northman is undoubtedly one of the best cinematic experiences of recent years it is an epic journey through the legend of amleth shaped by the vision of one of the greatest talents in cinema today robert eggers an exquisite technical sample on how to direct a film    northman explores the violent character of the human being in an immersive hypnotic and wild way it flourishes with a rather ambitious narrative and a story about revenge power struggles and destiny the representations at times symbolic of valhalla helheim the valkyries among others are masterful moments within the film added to the superb performances its staging and its soundtrack this film is undoubtedly one of the best of the year and in recent years
May 31 2022,negative,could have been a epic movie but instead it was disappointing and a little boring i was so pumped for this movie and i wanted to love it 
May 31 2022,positive,an epic historical film directed by robert eggers based on the legend of amleth a viking prince who sets out on a quest to avenge the murder of his father by his uncle he is a figure in a medieval scandinavian legend the direct inspiration of the character of prince hamlet full of an amazing cinematography and incredible artistic shots it is a cinematic experience for the ages it truly has an authentic and gorgeous aesthetic incredible acting and a brutal and bloody revenge tale that is quite memorable the surreal imagery along with the sounds and the score make it a hauntingly beautiful movie
May 31 2022,negative,im sorry this was horrible and false advertising if youre looking for an epic viking tale of taking back a stolen kingdom dont waste your time
May 31 2022,positive,although the movie is a bit of a disappointment which is greatly increase due to the fact i thought it was going to be an amazing movie which we all so desperately need the cinematography fighting scenes and acting is pretty damn good the movie lacked a little in the storyline and seems rushed at the end
May 31 2022,negative,the plot was hard to follow the movie had too much gratuitous violence and was difficult to follow at times
May 31 2022,positive,it blends lots of themes in a sensitive and stylish way  the film is immersive and transports the viewer into an older world visually and in value systems and beliefs  its use of supernatural themes and the way they there was no divide between that and the real world was clever and thought provoking  excellent casting gave believable portraits of the characters  nicole kidman was particularly unhinged
May 31 2022,positive,fantastic movie the reviews had me a bit scared but its worth it to ignore the critics and give it a watch the combat  the story  the character development  the music  the location  best film of the year
May 31 2022,positive,incredible movie held me like a vice the whole time i love norse history so the attention to detail and the depiction of the shamanistic aspects of norse religion was simply incredible
May 30 2022,positive,awesome viking revenge tale that seems very accurate to what it mustve been like at the time there were some surprises and the cinematography was crazy gorgeous visuals
May 30 2022,positive,if you liked the green knight youll like this    the northman is viking hamlet amleth and it has its ups and downs the production quality is gorgeous the sets costumes and locations are immersive and thoroughly believable there are some standout performances from alexander skarsgard anya taylorjoy ethan hawk and claes bang willem defoe is along for a few scenes as well the film goes to pains to depict aspects of viking culture and beliefs that make for those not already in the know for seriously weird and trippy viewing parts have a hallucenigenic quality if you have made a study of the eddas and icelandic sagas you will find a staggering amount of imagery related to them woven into the film if all you know about viking culture comes from watching the mcu thor movies you may have enough to muddle through somehow despite high production values and great performances i just didnt like it very much
May 30 2022,positive,better than most out except for maverick 
May 30 2022,negative,uggghhh what a flop huge vikings fan and this just could have been so much more weak writing 
May 30 2022,positive,powerful directing very believable acting entertaining storyline
May 30 2022,neutral,very pretentious movie many scenes seem unnatural because the way you get there is completely forced by the director just to cause a  dramatic scene everything is plot driven rather than character driven  it is also very predictable as soon as you see the  characters presented in the first 34 minutes you  know what will happen  and please hallucination scenes are not character development
May 30 2022,neutral,took a good story with lots of fascinating viking myth andmade it a little weird not as visually stunning as they claimthere was so much more they could have done and tried to inject funny moments that fall flat and came cross as gross and a lot of the malingering feud just feels drawn out for no purpose cool cinematography though
May 30 2022,positive,brilliant detail great mythical mystical story   epic
May 30 2022,positive,absolute must see lots of fighting and suspense lots of immersion blood and brutality
May 30 2022,positive,after the slow burns of the witch and the lighthouse the fast pace here was quite the shock this is an action film its a thoughtful and gorgeous one of course but its filled with bloody fights chest pounding and screaming good thing i like that sort of stuff but its not for everyone
May 30 2022,positive,this is the kind of movie where eggers interest in the given subject and his understanding of the visual iconography set him apart from other directors but the story itself becomes repetitive and too long some of the actors are unconvincing or unconvinced skasgård looks very determined though the movie is spectacular but it could be more
May 30 2022,negative,eggers misses again the movie is pretentious and boring
May 30 2022,positive,its definitely a new look at vikings age but the plot it self is incoherent sometimes
May 30 2022,positive,a fantastic work of art visually stunning and often frightening the battles play out like gritty horror rather than typical action scenes and it works not what i was expecting but something fresh and impressive all the same
May 30 2022,positive,an absolute gorgeous movie amazing storytelling and cinematic experience the look of the film felt like it was portrayed with historical accuracy eggers the whole cast did an amazing job worth watching for those who interest themselves with viking history
May 30 2022,positive,hands down for robert eggers
May 30 2022,positive,i liked it alot  reminded me of vikings tv series if you liked that you will like this
May 30 2022,negative,predictable and just too unbalanced the film started out with a fair amount of promise but it never turned into either a gritty human story or a magical adventure  and the lava scene just stupid bleah
May 30 2022,positive,i love the historical references of this movie
May 30 2022,neutral,some good acting and scenery only be letdown by a tedious drawn out revenge narrative rehashed from movies such as gladiator braveheart the movie was 3040 minutes too long and couldve done a lot more with the stellar cast on offer i guess the budget was spent on the actors because the visual effects looked like something from the 80s
May 30 2022,positive,after all the hype this movie was a let down not a bad movie but not great i think our expectations are so low nowadays that a movie that doesnt suck is considered good could have done without the mystical elements of the movie kind of ruined it for me all in all it is worth watching but not the blockbuster i was expecting
May 30 2022,positive,the director deftly unveiled a novel approach to a highly complex narrative i especially appreciated the cinematography and the setting excellent acting by an exceptional cast
May 29 2022,positive,sophisticated fictionalization of a classic viking story
May 29 2022,negative,straightforward and boring alexander skarsgard cant carry a film
May 29 2022,positive,gorgeous to look at violent and gritty this is a viking tale of revenge full of brutal action and big stunning visuals that despite eggers clearly having a much larger budget to work with than hes used to still retain his signature look that always includes arthouse vibes a brooding atmosphere and an impressive attention to detail and authenticity never feeling too hollywood polished as for the story and character development its based on a norse tale that inspired hamlet so its all very familiarfeeling with the main story beats being almost entirely predictable its here that i wish eggers had been as inventive as he normally is daring to inject a little more weirdness into proceedings but i get it the northman was designed as an blockbuster epic and as such im sure he was limited in that department still this creates a problem its neither a fullon classic action film that will satisfy fans of the genre nor is it a fullon arthouse film that will satisfy diehard eggers fans instead its something in between and that could put it in a slightly difficult position so is it as good as   his previous films i dont think so but that doesnt mean there isnt a lot to enjoy
May 29 2022,negative,what a terrible movie
May 29 2022,negative,this movie was dark full of killing and odd to sit through i understood the revenge for his dad but there was no cohesion only way u can get into it if u enjoy extreme weirdness
May 29 2022,negative,given the cast i went to this movie with pretty high expectations and could not have been more disappointed there were some excellent individual performances and visually it was stunning but thats about it i get those were brutal times but it felt like they created the movie by piecing together scenes of brutality hoping it would magically transform into something epic unfortunately in my opinion they completely missed the mark
May 29 2022,positive,an absolute epic phenomenal cast great story line outstanding attention to detail
May 29 2022,negative,save yourselves the agony of walking out of theater wondering how you allowed yourselves to waste 2 hours of your lives and can never get back
May 29 2022,negative,great cameos  terrible story
May 29 2022,positive,this movie was a beautiful raw experience the acting was top notch pacing was great with never a dull moment  the story was simple enough for me to focus on the fascinating world building im so satisfied with this one of the best of 2022 so far
May 29 2022,negative,i am not in the writer director or producers brain  i had a difficult time following this mess of a movie  to many whys and whats going on for me   let someone else rewrite this scrambled egg and it has all the makings of a pretty good plot  dont forget to tie up all the loose ends you created
May 29 2022,positive,the northman was a truly captivating movie that was incredulously submersible the  atmosphere was beyond perfect truly another enthralling experience directed by robert eggers with his unique methods of forming mystique through imagery metaphors and folklore the storyline had a classic hamlet tone that some would say was dull but i say that eggers undeniably elevated the otherwise banal theme of course such is the eggers way to push boundaries by sexualizing the unconventional typically by using the incest trope i personally enjoyed the nod to the oedipus complex because it further added to the era immersion as well as the directors desire to provoke the audiences more customary convictions overall great film i definitely recommend taking the time to enjoy watching this movie
May 29 2022,negative,this grim parody of the lion king might have been saved with a combination of tighter editing and a shift in emphasis the surreal pagan fantasy elements were cool so cant we just have more of that instead of a dull retread of the revenge genre
May 29 2022,negative,the solid actors and interesting subject matter gave me high hopes its hard for me to understand how a movie this bad makes it out the door for release its bad like really bad the writing just asks the whole thing to the point of almost unwatchable wait for the free streaming release
May 29 2022,negative,boring and relentlessly so drags on for over 2 hours of interminable rubbish the highlight of which is the moment when the screen goes black and the end credits start
May 29 2022,negative,boring with good actors
May 29 2022,negative,one of the worst movies i have seen is a long while strange disjointed nonsensical  cheap and just bizarre yuck 
May 29 2022,negative,i give it a 310 it was kinda creepy in some parts made me uncomfortable some parts was confusing he down bad for leaving his bm w twins never sat in a movie and wanted it to end so bad in the end it was a big huh so stupid no wonder that screening was empty 
May 29 2022,positive,action with brains plus nicole kidman always
May 29 2022,negative,terrible script terrible editing it was awful to see and very dark with also a lot of plot holes
May 29 2022,positive,good movie 1000 better than most stuff made these days
May 29 2022,positive,this is very easily the best viking film ever made excellent revenge drama with a dash of fly agaric and drenched in historical accuracy  skarsgård certainly made an effort as hes damn near unrecognizable in all the bulk
May 29 2022,positive,robert eggers and movies about the bloody past name a more iconic duo    the northman is a folktale a horror story a historical epic a norse legend so many wideranging and retold accounts of this story have graced screens and stages the world over but eggers telling of the account is filled to the brim with accuracy that im sure rivals the collective knowledge of all viking historians and then some its shorn up with eraappropriate garb and swords and ships and songs and rituals    and for all those attempts at realism and authenticity the movie also possesses a sense of the unknown and the otherworldly are the gods the antagonists cry out to real are the spirits the protagonists see actually there sometimes no yes that fleeting sense of uncertainty must have at some point clouded the judgment of one person or another in those times so why should the movie be any different    but for me the emotional connection i was sure id have with the main character of amleth felt forced upon me we spend so little time with him before hes facing down his bloody quest for revenge and go so short a distance with his own coming to terms with his lifes purpose that the only thing you cling to as a viewer is the scenerythe world around him that pulls you in with every gorgeous lush shot     the northman is a good movie its wellthoughtout evocative violent and tempered by a director and writer who clearly understands what made this legend stick through history long enough to see it spawn a multitude of emotionally gripping retellings     i just wish this had been one of them
May 28 2022,negative,after watching the trailer i was so pumped for the movie little did i know that the next 2 hours would go from one missed opportunity to the next what should have been a dive into the norse culture of the 900s and violent gritty fight scenes became a weak attempt at a revenge movie with terrible character archs and strange love story such a shame
May 28 2022,negative,not a good movie the vikings on to were better   lots of yelling and weird stuff no good story no action not a good plot   really a very badly made movie   more of a b movie
May 28 2022,positive,it was somehow an extended episode of a new vikings serie i was kind of dissapointed by the sequal filming time gaps and lack of characters dept  the acting was a bit overacting  not a bad film but it missed something to be great
May 28 2022,positive,a hardcore brutal film director robert eggers delivers a beautifully filmed epic that i wont forget for many many years to come nicole kidman steals all of her scenes in a thrilling performance as well
May 28 2022,positive,a masterpiece in cinematic violence the lead actors are well cast and the performances are great with some surreal sequences dreams thrown in for fantasy effect the underlying plot is gritty and believable
May 28 2022,neutral,the critic reviews on the tomatometer must be fake or paid reviews because this movie is terrible  makes no sense has no real plot and most of the movie is spent watching a guy howl like a dog  the ending omg why what   i watched this movie because the critics rated it at a 78 but todays critic reviews you just cant trust anymore its lucky to be a 4 rating movie
May 28 2022,positive,really enjoyed it super natural aspects and all eggers does a great job of striking a balance between authenticity and art house 
May 28 2022,negative,very difficult to enjoy it could have been a short movie character development was terrible the lead actors role was awful
May 28 2022,positive,the movie is interesting its not a movie for the general public its interesting to see the similarities between the northman hamlet and the lion king it was also very cool the very theatrical performance of the actors reminding us of the plays in the theaters very artistic direction beautiful landscapes and fidelity to the reality of the time simple and objective story the battles are not elaborately choreographed and very kungfu which is very good because the vikings fought with objectivity and brutality even clumsy as shown in the film rj  brazil  o filme é interessante não é um filme para o grande público é interessante ver as semelhanças entre o homem do norte hamlet e o rei leão foi muito legal também a atuação bem teatral dos atores nos lembrando das peças nos teatros direção muito artística belas paisagens e fidelidade com a realidade da época história simples e objetiva as batalhas são não têm coreografias elaboradas e muito kungfu o que é muito bom por que os vikings lutavam com objetividade e brutalidade até desengonçados como é mostrado no filme rj  brasil
May 28 2022,positive,to be honest if this came out ten years ago i would give it three stars but this day and age its hard to find anything remotely good anymore due to the woke agenda that hollywood feels the need to shove down our throats every second of the day and as there is a total lack of wokeness in this movie think  it deserves an extra star
May 28 2022,neutral,i  went into this with no expectations but just to watch the gambit queen star flex her acting chops and well they delivered on the acting but the story is long overdrawn and focuses on so much mythology i got lost in somewhere in the movies
May 28 2022,positive,a lot of people dont understand that this movie is based on the source material for hamlet which is a norse legend its also supposed to be theatrical and play like thats why many people describe it as incoherent or no plot or confusing this is not a movie about viking for all those who complain that its not like the show please know what you are watching before rating it badly because you expected a straight forward viking action movie
May 28 2022,negative,the plot and acting was so awfully bad and predictable that my friends and i left the theatre after about an hour never in my entire life of 36 years i have seen such a garbage that made me leave never  i loved the vikings series btw
May 28 2022,negative,the whole movie is like a bad trip on those shrooms totally disconnected from reality common sense and storytelling art absolute nonsense the only good thing is vendel ring sword
May 28 2022,positive,it is a awesome movie that plays out like norse mythology story
May 28 2022,positive,the scoundrel listened to the slanderous rumor that he wanted to be a scoundrel to the end and declared bankruptcy to prevent the fine from being paid  this is ridiculous see you at prisonguo liar
May 28 2022,positive,for me anywaynot very original storybut visually impressive
May 28 2022,positive,the northman was good cant go wrong with viking hamlet
May 28 2022,negative,how anyone sat through this whole thing is beyond me  this is seriously the worst movie i have ever seen
May 28 2022,positive,scrolling through the reviews here makes me sad sad about how misunderstood eggers and this movie are sad about how it bombed at the box office and especially sad how many people totally misunderstand how the norse culture worked during the dark ages and to everyone criticizing the music i thought it was amazing they really used actual instruments from the time as someone who invested a big part learning about viking culture i can truly say this movie is the best depiction of how the people were thinking ive ever seen if you actually know your stuff and didnt just watch vikings or play valhalla its obvious how much time eggers spent doing research the language the beliefs of the characters the music and the rites its all so done so well this is not meant to be a character driven epic this is a depiction of old norse beliefs and an incredibly artsy one at that
May 27 2022,positive,skarsgard leads the epic revenge of his father in iceland bloody dark and visually stunning  its heavier on the moodiness than extended fight scenes
May 27 2022,negative,we almost left the movie before it ended i scanned through a number of comments and am dumbfounded by comments holding this movie in high regard character development was weak storyline was weak editing was weak directing was weak music was weak if i were the financial backer i would have been quite upset 
May 27 2022,positive,really great story telling superb performances so realistic at times very happy i saw this on a big screen
May 27 2022,negative,that movie was absolutely terrible
May 27 2022,negative,went into this expecting some interesting stuff due to it being lauded as super historical accurate what followed was somehow boring cringe frustrating and confusing all at the same time there are a few points that are legitimately fun to watch one fight in particular left a very lasting memory in my mind but 3 minutes of enjoyment do not make up for the other 2 hours of disappointment now i know how all my dates must feel
May 27 2022,positive,entire movie was too dark could bearly see what was going on  do not like movies shot with this type of color  was there no sunshine ever in that time period
May 27 2022,negative,way too many plotholes and overall wierdness kid running around like a dog farting queen kissing her son on the mouth guy magically finds a boat leaving the island and magically gets a sword from a druid he met on a completely different continent 20 years ago i was angry by the time this movie ended
May 27 2022,neutral,i cannot find the words to explain it but its alright i just wish they added some climactic scenes to it the score should be more climactic im going to be honest i think things are getting better for me whenever anya taylor joy is on the screen
May 27 2022,positive,wow more please epic epic epic skyrim in big screen 
May 27 2022,negative,scenery and the locations of iceland were great screenplay was slow action scenes were okay hated the bizarre rituals depicted in the movie
May 27 2022,positive,the best viking movie ever made
May 26 2022,positive,fantastic movie violent brutal and mystic best movie of alexander skarsgård so far
May 26 2022,positive,finally something lorehistorically based not ruined by idiots an epic journey of an epic man with the views of simplest nature loyalty a great tragedy and a great success story violence justice mystery and a dash of romance this movie gets all marks from me sure some people might complain about gratutitous violence but those same people complain not about gratuitous sex you simply must watch
May 26 2022,positive,wow left speechless
May 26 2022,positive,loved it gritty muscular and exceptionally crafted viking story
May 26 2022,neutral,visually stunning a simple story with very good acting just way too long and certainly not a movie youd watch multiple times
May 25 2022,negative,the story wasnt compelling the relationship between son and father which should have been set up emotionally in the first act to help sons want and arc throughout the film and to make the audience root for him throughout the film wasnt set up instead of creating an emotional connection there was this ritualistic scene that was more gratuitous than anything so from the getgo it was hard to care about the main character the casting was off  too many big named actors and beautiful looking people were difficult to look past and dint help in making the story compelling or believable nicole kidman is a talented actress but i couldnt get past the plastic surgery that made it difficult to believe she lived during these times and anya taylor joy also very talented but too pretty for this movie it was hard to see a respected viking king in ethan hawke  the film tried to hide its lack of substance behind alisters gratuitous violence and attempts at highbrow shakespeareanwannabe sequences  being a fan of the show vikings and valhalla the northman was boring unbelievable and laughable
May 25 2022,negative,long movie that is hard to follow  accents and language cause difficulties in understanding without an understanding of norse mythology and tribal religious practices it is easy to get lost there is nothing new to the plot its similar to a greek dark comedytragedy without the meaty flavor to make you care about virtually any of the characters everyone does and you go away saying so what
May 25 2022,positive,good acting and sets story a bit convoluted
May 25 2022,positive,dark as norse mythology is wishing for a sneak peak on the twins future at the end
May 25 2022,negative,the plot is absolutely standard among other things it is difficult to follow the film due to the senseless and exaggerated psychedelic depiction of the cultural life of the vikings many dark scenes and the detrimental dialogues the movie also never manages to pull you into his orbit entirely and follow the over 2 hours of running time attentively
May 25 2022,negative,it seemed low budget and bad acting i couldnt get past the first 30 minutes and i did try twice
May 25 2022,positive,the movie held my attention til the very end great story
May 25 2022,positive,good film good actors beautifull picture nice setting wathching at big screen only
May 25 2022,positive,a common recurring trend for me lately seems to be my expectations being high going in  leaving the movie afterward feeling as if the movie did not meet those expectations this movie regrettably continued that trend    it was very pretty in many parts but just being pretty isnt enough to make up for what was a long kind of dull viking story shame
May 25 2022,negative,this is probably the strangest movie ive ever seen
May 25 2022,negative,bad acting too violent like unnecessarily violent the movie was extremely uncomfortable to watch from start to finish me and my wife almost left the theater
May 25 2022,negative,beautifully shot but emotionally hollow i simply didnt care about or connect with the characters you remain as detached watching this as you do reading hamlet in grade 9 english class the fight scenes were anticlimactic and boring other movies have done revenge and spectacle way better mad max fury road comes to mind  great soundtrack though
May 25 2022,positive,a masterpiece and an unforgettable cinematic experience
May 25 2022,positive,the northman is a gritty and violent viking tale its eggers most mainstream but hes still present in everything the stunning icelandic locations and epic battles are made for the big screen bloody brilliant
May 25 2022,positive,robert eggers returns once again in an action and adventure story of a viking prince who is hungry for revenge unfortunately the film is not what i expected and its not what the trailer was showing the films story is typical but the writing and eggers directing helped in shaping the story to be an amazing film that is one of a kind   the fight and action sequences are not realistic at times and are stupid however i think the action sequences are meant to be like that so it would be unfair to criticize them much so if they are meant to be like that then they are decent    the film is packed with a great cast that plays their role perfectly starting with alexander skarsgård who plays the vicious boy who is hungry for revenge and turns into a monster as audience members get to experience his journey and his character development or how he became a monster by the end of the film in my opinion the journey of amleth is a great journey that is told in a great way and in a decent pace worth noting that the boy who plays young amelth at the beginning of the film oscar novak in my opinion did a great job as his acting was surprising to me also he was the one who shaped the first impression that audience members have on the character of amleth and he gave us a hint of what we are about to experience from older amleth played by alexander skarsgård in the rest of the film many films lack in choosing a good actor to play a young version of a specific character in terms of the looks acting etc but this movie really succeeded anya taylor joy once again proves herself as a talented young actress who has a bright future however at times i felt like she did not present anything different from the previous characters that she played like the queens gambit or the witch same facial expressions and same look nothing new but that dont stop her from being a great actress     the sound mixing at most times was bad and made hearing not clear as some voices were on top of each other especially at times where there was music playing in the background as it was so loud at times the film at times feels like its just showing visuals more than telling a story however the last act was more than great as i was surprised at how the way the story is told changed compared to the previous acts the pace alongside the events of the last act was enough to make me on the edge of my seat wondering what will happen next and where will the characters end up at the ending of the film which in my opinion was more than great and unexpected i dont want to make it seem as if it was crazy because it wasnt but i just think that it did fit the story and im satisfied with it    last but not least the great music score of robin carolan and sebastian gainsborough supported the action sequences as they made scenes seem more real fun vicious and thrilling not the best film and not the one expected but not so bad at the same time     my rating is 710
May 25 2022,positive,the story was great just needed more viking violence
May 25 2022,negative,this movie is everything that is wrong with historically inspired hollywood films its absurd i can break the movie down to its three parts part 1 hairy man screams at fire part 2 hairy men in cave scream at fire part 3 revenge this is complete fantasy nothing to do with anything historical the setting people and general tone is ridiculous the idea these people no matter how far back in history were just savages is not true the premise of the movie whilst different does not mean it is good boiled down it is the same old revenge plot youve seen 1000 times its as if someone watched vikings thinking it was a historical documentary then used that as their baseline
May 25 2022,negative,slow and boring  the plot is quite inconsistent when the protagonist voluntarily becomes a slave to carry out his revenge  the story then continues in a very predictable way  ridiculous are the scenes where warriors indulge in imitating wolves and other animals during magical rituals  a film with a bad story and a not very expressive protagonist  there are much better tv series about vighingos
May 25 2022,positive,i found this epic story of viking revenge to be quite fantastic i love robert eggers and while i think this movie is great with absolutely beautiful scenery the lighthouse and the vvitch are superior to this movie not by much but they exceed this movie and show that maybe eggers works better with a smaller budget would highly recommend seeing this
May 25 2022,positive,the presentation and and symbolism is very well done
May 25 2022,positive,perfect cinematography with good action scenes soundtrack and script a great movie
May 25 2022,negative,horribly slow  uninteresting 
May 25 2022,negative,there are better viking shows free on tv
May 25 2022,negative,spectacle over storytelling
May 25 2022,negative,terrible  i almost left part way through  i stayed but it was torture
May 25 2022,negative,this movie was well put together however the storyline seemed a bit too hard to follow i believe it follows norse mythology but the way it was presented seemed too complicated the cinematography was beautiful and the settings and locations were amazing poor bjork looked horrible and barely had 10 minutes in the movie nicole kidman looked so old and her role was very believable because she is a haggard broad i do not believe you need to see this in the theater and think it can also wait until it is playing on cable to watch
May 24 2022,positive,spectacular breathtaking and bewildering  we all know that robber eggers is  a great director this is the most legit thing although in  the northaman  he goes beyond the limites of what can be possible and shows his true potential this movie has more budget than the previous ones but this dont make the movie less he used the money to make a masterpiece of art the movie is brutal mud and bloody and his obsession with accuracy makes everything even better
May 24 2022,positive,was a surprise ending
May 24 2022,positive,it was long  gruesome   the ending just left you thinking is that it
May 24 2022,neutral,the filmcelluloid is gorgeous everything else needs some help
May 24 2022,positive,would get a five if not for the dodgy accents
May 24 2022,positive,weird too steeping in viking religion and mysticism for my taste the battle scenes were too few but the cinematography was excellent
May 24 2022,positive,first of all please do not judge this based on some of these 12 star reviews here  please consider the sourceone of which thinks monster hunter 2020 was a 5 star film  its also not northmans fault that your tv crushes blacks  zero issues on my properly tuned g1 and i also found its use of atmos audio well implemented and enjoyable      going into in this film i was expecting a viking version of braveheart its slightly different as its skews into norse mythology blending it into the main characters perception of reality  it gives you a sense of how a person at that time interpreted the world around them with a heavy influence from their religious beliefs  the film gives a somewhat plausible explanation to it all by the use of mind altering substances without going too far over the top  its definitely still hollywood but probably the best viking movie out there as far as its historical accuracy  i can see how your average hamnegger would say that the plot isnt perfect but this movie doesnt care about that  its sole purpose is to show you the world and events through the eyes of the main character  its succeeds at making you understand his motivations what he was feeling and ultimately what it was like to be him during that time       this a great viking movie  thank god this wasnt made for everyone or else it wouldve been horrible
May 24 2022,positive,a beautiful film adaptation of scandinavian legend of amleth  dark and filled with both nordic and slavic pagan beliefs at every step
May 24 2022,positive,phenomenal  a brutal retelling of the source material that inspired hamlet presented so meticulously and historically accurate that you walk out of the theater feeling like you know what the 10th century looked like  norse mythology is presented as real as it was to the vikings themselves intertwining the natural and supernatural  the hero is a classical hero immensely flawed and driven by fate  you are not meant to identify with any character from this film but rather observe how their blunt world views motivate their actions and ultimately become obstacles  the acting is incredible all around but particularly nicole kidman  this film is a visceral experience that you are unlikely to find elsewhere  dont expect a run of the mill action romp youll get much much more
May 24 2022,positive,if you like feeling emotions and having unique experiences this movie is for you
May 24 2022,negative,awful  this is what you get when you have a 30 min story to tell yet extending it to 25 hrs   everything is stretched out extremely slow at times incoherent and of course you run out of budget so you tune brightness of the whole movie to 30 so you can use crappy animation and special effects without people noticing them or  seeing them    worst movie of the year yes even worse than the already awful firestarter
May 24 2022,positive,good not great at least its not about the message in a time of wokeness its a refreshing little revenge tale in an odd yet not mythical setting and time
May 24 2022,positive,i was extremely surprised because i wasnt a fan of thewitch the directors first movie very good story and made it easy to read at times needed and still follow along if you like very cerebral and historical movies then look no further
May 24 2022,negative,a visually striking mess the northman is both predictable and dull with no compeling characters or twists to justify its existence resulting in a complete misfire from robert eggers
May 24 2022,negative,the only redeemable part and i mean the only thing that made this movie watchable was the stunning cinematography and action sequences it really captured the beauty of iceland in the establishing shots that being said this movie was awful my friend and walked out after his mom kissed him they try so hard to be edgy cool and new but it comes across as pagan hedonistic overly graphic with sex and brutality and just plain stupid dont waste your time with this movie
May 24 2022,negative,couldnt make it through 30 mins terrible
May 23 2022,positive,the northman is a glorious and bloody fantasy adventure which has recently dropped into cinemas    synopsis from visionary director robert eggers comes the northman an actionfilled epic that follows a young viking prince on his quest to avenge his fathers murder    the northman is very much in the same style of 2021s the green knight as in its a fantasy story based on fable looks stunning and is so gritty you feel dirty from watching it    at times its subtle in its storytelling but in the main youre met with a story which is brutal from the off spinning head long into a finale of death destruction and hope    i really didnt think id like this it had be gripped for the 2hr run time    definitely give this a go    810
May 23 2022,positive,this movie is not for everyone its dark and broody and tells a minimal talking psychedelic and nordic telling of hamlet from the epic score to the trippy shots this movie takes you on a trip throughout a crazy revenge plot if you like stories that tell myths and legends in brutal fashion this is the movie for you for those who find this movie hard to follow or confusing i suggest looking up the plot once you get the idea it makes the rest of the plot easier to follow
May 23 2022,positive,northman is kind of a mix between boewulf and the green knight the story has its share of fantasymythology elements yet it is still grounded in reality of that era that acting is superb the action is gory but not too extreme the music on point and you feel very attached to the main character and his ordeals its not a perfect movie in terms of rythm but after the first half its more balanced i give it 82 a good mythical movie that is adult theme oriented
May 23 2022,positive,you will find that the story is a tad lacking in smoothness very choppy and quick which does not lead well to character development saved only by the incredible acting of alexander skarsgård and a clever twist and turn
May 23 2022,positive,robert eggers latest actionfilled epic following a young viking prince on his quest to avenge his fathers murder its a familiar story with an aggressively unique presentation alexander skarsgård carries this movie and gives one hell of a performance the direction and score are also great but there were character decisions that left me scratching my head overall intriguing experience and skarsgårds performance is well worth your time
May 23 2022,positive,compelling raw and hard to understand the world they live in modern audiences wont like it because its not straight hollywood this feels like an indi film with a blockbuster budget and no those arent braces you know what im talking about
May 23 2022,positive,not a movie to digest before a night out it is cruel contains a lot of violence and has no humor at all but thats what makes it very authentic to how vikings must have lived and how their religion and morality lead to a continuous stream of retaliations
May 23 2022,negative,worst movie of the year terrible acting terrible ending just bad overall
May 23 2022,positive,very interesting movie i actually really liked it
May 23 2022,negative,this movie was boring at best a straight forward  viking revenge story with plot armour as thick as the minds of guys who praise this movie
May 23 2022,positive,ive given this nearly 5 stars as i feel that is what it deserves the story is good the acting is brilliant and the cinematography is out of this world  my only complaints are that it could do be be 20 minutes shorter as its a bit draggy in places and that there is a bit too much mumblespeak as you find yourself going what did heshe just say  but overall well worth watching
May 23 2022,positive,primal brutal and the perfect movie for a saturday night alexander skarsgård is vicious and anya taylorjoy the perfect opposite
May 23 2022,positive,great blend of spiritual  physical and mythological
May 23 2022,negative,whatever it was trying to do it didnt work for me i wish id died and gone to valhalla with the king in the beginning id have had a better time i reckon
May 23 2022,positive,wonderful blockbuster filmmaking by one of the best modern directors
May 23 2022,positive,the delivery of some actors is not worthy of good praise the main character is boring and sometimes the plot is too convenient to make sense
May 23 2022,positive,excelent performances tight and though provoking script breathtaking cinematography a love letter to viking culture and mithology that at the same time reflects on the cycle of violence that prevailed on ancient cultures like this and still shapes our society the northman effortless rises well above all viking portrayals in fiction to date with permission of valhalla rising may be hated by those who seek fastpaced mindless action and jokes created for modern audiences
May 23 2022,negative,it is one of the worst films ive ever seen the acting was amateurish it was visually totally dark as was the predictable plot the costumes and scenery were seemingly authentic what you could see
May 23 2022,positive,stunningly beautiful and a great revenge tale not quite as solid a plot as his other movies but still a great view
May 23 2022,positive,another notch in eggers historical fablism belt the northman doesnt quite reach the heights you expect but it is engaging throughout much like the witch it asks what if the supernatural lens these people viewed the world through was real but their lived experience didnt really change because of it eggers answer i think is that it might as well be real because they viewed it that way but it doesnt make human interactions and conflicts any less messy ot frustrating these are important questions worth exploring but in the exploration you lose a little bit of the narrative much like the people in its story the northman leaves you wanting for a clear resolution that just isnt in the cards it is about a journey which may have potholes but is worth taking nonetheless 
May 23 2022,positive,great movie and action packed a must see
May 23 2022,negative,absolutely the worst movie ive ever seen
May 22 2022,positive,this is not a traditional action moviedont go in expecting that expect artfulmythicalbeautiful story telling if this were a rom com think more eternal sunshine than when harry met sally  for those of you who keep saying that it ripped off hamletyou should know that hamlet is based on emleth this is literally the original story of hamlet
May 22 2022,positive,the pure cinemas here i loved watching this movie with an amazing cast and directing
May 22 2022,positive,what people dont understand is that this movie is an epic its not the show vikings or the play hamlet its not over the top or cheesy its an epic look up the genre before claiming what you think you know this movie was about it 100 follows the epic genre and delivers all it promises to deliver excellent performances symbolism and symmetry stunning production quality its like youre watching an old norse myth come to life and thats exactly what it meant to accomplish  not a true bloodtype teen romance for women to fantasize about later
May 22 2022,negative,weird and way out there  hard to follow
May 22 2022,negative,the northman bad very disappointing movie ridiculously visually dark silly often bad cgi please just tell a story without all the tim burtonesque stylization  nicole kidmans stature totally unnecessary dozens of actresses could have made it the aging makeup that was done on her made her look like a typically aged 50 to 60 year old leaving one to think maybe thats how she really looks at her age not good for her career skarsgard overhyped in publicity as some terrifying frightening force the character of rollo in the history channels vikings was way more intimidating and sympathygenerating for audience connection development with the character i felt no connection with skarsgards character
May 22 2022,positive,there are many things i liked about this movie above all its setting the tell itself is trivial a story of revenge some might see it as retelling of hamlet but my god the setting took me to the times of premedieval pagan europe a place where a value of ones life was measured in the strength of their arm and where supernatural was as real as reality itself great nonpretentious storytelling with no exposition few meaningful dialogues a story confident in the strength of its visual language and the scenes it lets you witness    while i liked it i can see that it may not be for everyone some may think that its long and boring while others may accuse it of being unnecessarily violent dont watch it with kids the northman is definitely not trying to be everything for everyone which is refreshing
May 22 2022,positive,great visuals and sound with some quality acting from the supporting cast 
May 22 2022,positive,awesome viking mythos and violence
May 22 2022,neutral,weak plotbasically a synopsis of hamlet over actingthought is was a farce at times i love the vikings shows and i wanted to love this move but it was silly
May 22 2022,negative,waste of time nothing happened for 2 hours and 17 minutes
May 22 2022,positive,despite its slow pacing i did enjoyed the mood and cinematography of the witch that sentiment was not duplicated for the over rated light house robbert eggers the northman is definitely my preferred and favorite film of his so far from its impressive historical accurate production designs to some great performances from its cast oscar nod to nicole kidman for her role as the queen this hamlet inspired tale of revenge is visually stunning and with all its unflinching brutality thrilling from start to finish possibly an oscar contender
May 22 2022,negative,weak characters a whole lot of screaming primitive imagery this movie lacks weight doesnt embrace reality nor fantasy nor a unique synthesis of them both and just floats in between
May 22 2022,negative,what a waste of time
May 22 2022,positive,real gritty fight scenes that actually had me hooked whoa i loved it i believed it i felt it plot is derivative but execution is a 1010 also beautiful a breath of fresh air in a sea of cgi garbage favorite movie ive seen in so long honestly cant wait to watch again please hollywood more stuff like this women were tenacious and cunning feminine women men were brave rough tough and fighting animals almost no mercy in the entire film what a change of pace i loved it not preachy at all bravo sad gruesome beautiful and captivating i walked away devastated with an adrenaline rush like i had been through battle great job everyone
May 22 2022,positive,while the film is entertaining and with a fantastic performance by skarsgård i feel the pace of the film is quite slow at times just when you expect the story to progress another interlude interrupts it  be it a hallucination a game of knattleikr or a mystical side quest vengeance seems to be continuously delayed    this film had the bones to be a masterpiece but i feel it falls short
May 22 2022,positive,holy hit this was great i didnt like the start all that much but it picks up steam shortly after a lot of steam the score is 1010 cinematography is also very high level along with the dialogue which seems to be robert eggers most underrated quality alexander skarsgård in the leading role is nothing short of tremendous holy hell was he a bad ass mofo literally annihilating his enemies claes bang also put in one hell of a performance i thought anya taylorjoy was also very good nicole kidman was brilliant as per usual even willem dafoe in his limited scenes stole the show hes such a good actor hes really turned into one of my favorite actors overall i think this is a very good movie i would like to watch it one more time but first viewing straight out of the cinema i had a great time and thoroughly enjoyed it valhalla 95100
May 22 2022,positive,a different kind of hamlet story it has some cliches including the plot twist but if you like historical movies its recommended
May 22 2022,positive,the epitome of men will do x before going to therapy meme looks good but unsubstantial
May 22 2022,negative,terrible for so many reasons   one of the worst movies ive seen   hard to imagine how anyone could appreciate this cheesy ive the top film
May 22 2022,positive,brilliant film loved every minute of it
May 22 2022,positive,nice to see a story about a tortured protagonist rather than a gary stu hero
May 22 2022,negative,not what i thought it would be huge disappointment
May 22 2022,negative,literally the worst movie i have ever seen
May 22 2022,negative,kept waiting for something to happen something to move the story forward some surprising element but it was just pretty much a onedimensional eyeforandeye gore for gores sake mess and all the supposed norse mythology stuff just seemed silly made up dialog and nonsense ritual this is one that if i had been there by myself i would have been out of the theater after about 20 minutes or so gotta wonder what projects nicole kidman and ethan hawke are going to finance with whatever they get for participating in this turkey
May 22 2022,negative,awful film all gore no story
May 22 2022,positive,finally ive seen a real movie at cinema great script showing us a different approach of the hamlets history everyone should watch this masterpiece absolute amazing
May 22 2022,positive,i thought the story went longer than it should have overall i thought it was just an ok movie
May 22 2022,positive,fight scenes were very realistic id recommend it
May 21 2022,positive,robert eggers is undoubtedly one of the most talented directors of this generation the attention he pays to detail in his films is impressive this movie is excellent some hollywood elements are present in his third film and some parts are predictable but it is still an authorial film and a magnificent epic very satisfied
May 21 2022,positive,love movies in this time period and this didnt disappoint
May 21 2022,negative,the movie was very annoying  the sounds the voices  the story is weak  the producing is similar to animation cartoon even the acting was not convenient
May 21 2022,positive, shakespearian dramaticand so deep emotionally      a true masterpiece of art from beginning to end a dramatic tale an intense revenge story as well as an heartgrabbing love story a tormented heros journey but above all a particularly spiritual initiatory quest    multiple aspects of the movies are quite simply great the atmosphere is very unique the photography and colors are striking the landscapes and settings are spectacular    in the end it clearly is a mythological tale of the most shakespearian proportions deeply emotional in numerous ways and filled with several breathtaking moment    deeply poetic and striking emotionally there is violence indeed but the movie rightfully is crude in its purest expression which is justified because the world is cruel and so can be humans especially during these ancient times but what resonates the most indepth is that the movie really has a lot of heart all along and until its very last frame
May 21 2022,positive,absolutely fantastic a true epic
May 21 2022,positive,i really wanted to like this film i truly did anything that isnt marvel unfortunately this film was gloomy boring and uninteresting it began with the terrible strength of mankind to endure and impose adversity but the plot quickly fell flat theres nothing to learn no one to love or hate no way to develop a personality you never forget youre watching a movie which isnt meant as an insult but it could be you do not merge with it it may win an academy award for its production or costumes but none of it compensates for the films gloomy plodding and uninteresting tale
May 21 2022,negative,not sure what the appeal is for this film not one character i cared about by the end i didnt care who lived or died the only ones i cared anything about were the innocent ones slaughtered along the way  waste of 2 hours
May 21 2022,neutral,super mediocre nothing special the ending was weird too
May 21 2022,negative,one dimensional threadbare revenge plot with no emotional depth and anticlimactic utterly predictable finale strange and unfulfilling film  ive definitely seen worse but this is nowhere near the heights critics would lead you to believe
May 21 2022,positive,very unique took me a little while to get into it as it wasnt at all what i expected but once i got into it and gave it a chance i realized how unique it was a masterpiece but you really have to put yourself into the right mood a late weekend night a few glasses of wine a  very interesting one
May 21 2022,positive,this is an instant classic raw mystical and fantastic shot scenes it is a must watch
May 21 2022,negative,the opening narration threatened a poor plot and lack of character development and the rest of the movie bore out that promise foreshadowed cunning never happened the attempts at plot were contrived the production value although generally high had an immersion shattering flaw and the climax was a let down  someone or a group wanted a bunch of cool visuals in a viking movie and they succeeded in their effort what a total waste of the cast   two stars is generous but i liked seeing cool visuals in a viking movie
May 21 2022,negative,worst film i have seen for ages slow noisy wet and miserable why do film makers think that the scrunchy sound you get from bashing flesh makes good viewing dont waste your time
May 21 2022,positive,solid from the cinematography to the lighting effects and transitions very technically well done plenty of savagery and despair with just the right sprinkling of hope and valhalla
May 21 2022,positive,its dark gritty gory and very very masculine for lack of a better word    theres a lot of yelling and screaming and fighting but theres always a sense of heart behind everything its a great movie and itll be exactly what youre looking for if you want something aggressive and bloody i just found the aesthetic to be a little overwhelming at times
May 21 2022,positive,high production values and a script with potential were let down by poor acting and computergame style hack  slash action sequences
May 21 2022,positive,fantastic good action and great characters
May 21 2022,negative,movie was ok  was expecting more action
May 21 2022,negative,this entire movie was the oracle dancing in 300
May 21 2022,negative,this movie was horrible killing of so many women and children on top of witchcraft very disappointed we left the movie we need positive movies inspirational movies
May 21 2022,negative,i dont eventhis was an absolute dumpster fire of a movie visually striking but that was the best the movie has to offer everything else can be summed up to terrible actingwritinglines very weird and borderline embarrassing scenes screaming constantly etc couldnt make it all the way through  obnoxious and annoying
May 21 2022,positive,fresh movie the dialogues the photografy great movie
May 21 2022,negative,the northman was a miss in my opinion from someone who enjoyed hbos vikings i expected to be a fan of this movie however the director tried to do too much wasting time on artsy scenes that did not advance the plot and came off as cringy and goofy
May 21 2022,negative,the movie was nothing like the trailer i mean people were walking out of the movie it was just not good at all
May 21 2022,positive,it was difficult to understand
May 21 2022,positive,watching the vikings series is the model to follow but this director went a less satisfying path this movie was ok but not great   our protagonist is wronged by his uncle who kills his father to become king and he escapes as a child seeking revenge he repeats his oath that he swore to his father 1 revenge his father 2 save his mother 3 kill his uncle  spolier ending sucked considering he killed his mother and died seconds after he killed his uncleboo we like the antagonist to win not tie i get that its a little dark and that was fine but we want to leave the movie feeling avenged and satisfied not frustrated
May 21 2022,positive,its not a bad movie i enjoyed the rawness of it its edgy it does drag a bit its 30 mins too long but a solid movie
May 21 2022,positive,solid cast but the movie was too trippy by half  very dark both in filming and subject matter  in the end it was well made and well portrayed but just not for me
May 21 2022,positive,robert eggers is definitely my favorite modern director working today hes batted 3 for 3 with his films so far and im always incredibly excited to see what he does this is definitely a masterpiece in my eyes the story is simplistic yet effective because the character work is really good we can get an understanding of everyones goals and why they do what they do alexander skarsgård does an incredible job here same with the rest of the cast i cant point out one bad performance here everyone is on top of their game nicole kidman and anya taylorjoy give my favorite performances in film both of their characters are really cool and interesting but kidmans character has a really messed up and creepy twist that makes you feel differently about the film and its themes of revenge and family honor claes bang does a fantastic job as the villain as well the way eggers directs and shots this film is incredible every shot looks absolutely stunning and its incredibly clear to me through the directing that its eggers in that chair with his style of epicness to scenes all the action in this is amazing eggers doesnt cut around like most blockbusters do he keeps the camera on the action at all times and makes sure that audience can clearly see whats happening there is a volcano battle at the end thats absolutely amazing the music here is great as well every aspect of this film is just incredible and shows its worthy of the title of masterpiece this film lives up its title of a viking epic and its a must see for anyone who wants an action heavy epic
May 21 2022,positive,really good movie a must see
May 21 2022,positive,well i decided to check it out despite the audience reviews  i figured since i love shoes like vikings and the last kingdom that i would have enjoyed this movie  not the case it does not compare to the two show i mentioned  just about revenge and then a bunch of sorcerywitchcraft that didnt really do the movie justice  took away from the hardcore vikings that im used to watching  i give it a c at best
May 20 2022,positive,an epic tale layerd in norse mythology
May 20 2022,negative,horrrrible acting in this dumpster fire of a movie you would think with a cast like this your in for something good but lord no this director needs rethink his future in the movie business
May 20 2022,positive,beautiful trippy and masterful it did a great job incorporating psychedelics to explain mythology and rituals of vikings
May 20 2022,negative,we walked out of this movie  i have never done that one before  this one doesnt even rate a half of star
May 20 2022,positive,an oddball thats neither as good nor as bad as many people claim the plot was a generic revenge story mixed with weird religioussuperstitious content i wasnt a fan of all the visions and prophecy parts which were frankly confusing without understanding the history but the undercover aspect of the revenge did give the story a bit of flare the characters were also a bit silly and over the top unbelievable but the acting was reasonable then the runtime could have been shorter and the choreography was nonsense with the enemies not even attempting to attack most of the time however the film was beautiful to look at and listen to the production design seemed like a relatively accurate portrayal and the scenery was gorgeous it made for a cinematic experience although some would argue the gore was excessive which is fair and the visual effects at the end stood out as not being immersive
May 20 2022,negative,freaking people screaming for the entire movie national geographic is more fun at home
May 20 2022,negative,this was 2 hours of my life ill never get back worst movie ive ever seen embarrassed for all involved
May 20 2022,negative,and another crappy movie its ingmar bergman meets national geographic meets slasher flicks not only does it all happen in the north making it nordic it also has this typical nordic exacerbated dramatic movie style and worst of all they often speak some nordic language like icelandic and the editors during often long stretches simply forgot to add the subtitles  it starts off interesting and tense for like 20 minutes and then it becomes a complete dark bore if it werent for the occasional beautiful landscapes i might have left early 210 points
May 20 2022,negative,odd pacing and incoherant character decision making  another triumph of visual impact and style over storytelling  barely managed to watch it all
May 20 2022,negative,i hated everything about this movie except for one joke and the very end it was extremely uncomfortable to watch so much so that it was u enjoyable and i was tempted to walk out more than once included many themes that i try to avoid that i think many people would find triggering or at least upsetting i usually like how music adds to the film experience but the dissonance sometimes used was so aggressive top three most disliked films ever if not the number 1 spot
May 20 2022,negative,it sucks balls the screenplay is bad the acting is bad the directing is bad the whole movie is you guesed it bad
May 20 2022,positive,i was entertained by the cinematography and the acting cast of this movie not the best nordic movie nor tv show yet might not reach expectations also but worth watching looking forward for more nordic moviesshows
May 20 2022,positive,a fun interesting thrilling experience the visuals are amazing the music is intense breathtaking set design and location choices good acting good story good action very artistic
May 20 2022,positive,there is no christian morality i this movie i think its beautiful
May 20 2022,positive,brutal bloody and bleak a sprawling and emotional viking epic a very gripping shakespearean experience that strangely enough had 300 cross lion king vibes definitely a great film
May 20 2022,positive,the northman is a bloody and visually stunning viking epic that is brutal and intensely entertaining
May 20 2022,positive,pretty good movie good historical clothe and such  some problems such as the naked berserker berserker did not fight naked but they did exist i saw some people say they didnt and maybe those people should shut up and read some book about viking everything looks wonderful the writhing and the way they placed the story is they way sagas and anglo saxon story were put at the end i think you gotta like the time period and having read a bit from work of this period to like the movie
May 20 2022,positive,everything i expected it to be and more
May 20 2022,neutral,relentlessly brutal with nonsensical supernatural elements and the worst ending ever 
May 20 2022,positive,striking visuals unaccompanied by an equally compelling story
May 20 2022,negative,absolutely terrible 
May 20 2022,negative,spending this much on a viking epic while still getting almost every single historical aspect wrong is ridiculous viking berserkers did not exist vikings did not fight naked you cannot slice a mans nose clean off while lying on your back as a child    the dialogue and plot felt like a youtube influencer wrote it     style over substance if style is deranged viking fiction
May 19 2022,positive,it was a beautiful movie  beautiful sound  beautiful cinematography  i just expected more viking warfare based on previews and not as much postmodernism
May 19 2022,positive,an intimate look into the brutality of a time long past this film is as savage as it is poetic with scenes of blood soaked symbolism and heart fans of gladiator and got will likely appreciate both the grim aesthetic and the story being told while the beginning is slow and there are parts that drag the northman is a tale worth experiencing
May 19 2022,positive,a complete beast of a film
May 19 2022,positive,the movie had a good but basic story nothing special but not bad i enjoyed it
May 19 2022,positive,it was gory and very intense the plot was pretty basic but it did its job well
May 19 2022,negative,started off great then began to drag on i had really high hopes for this but was pretty disappointed based on the all star cast one of a handful of times where i considered walking out of a movie
May 19 2022,positive,the best way i can sum this one up is an opera of vengeance conveyed through creative cinematography and various elements of viking culture and mythology  i didnt like it quite as much as i thought i would but i appreciated the effort put in to take a simple idea and make it seem rather deep and extravagant
May 19 2022,positive,must see for everyone who enjoys northern myths and aesthetics
May 19 2022,negative,great cinematography throughout and some fun artistic choices toward the beginning but then increasingly morphs into a stale skarsgaard viking vanity project
May 19 2022,positive,robert eggers shakespeareinspired tale of glorious savagery is a resounding success as both a visual marvel and a profound character study the score and cinematography are beautifully absorbing and the period detail is outstanding its a brutal uncompromising vision that proves once again that eggers is one of the most gifted filmmakers of our time
May 19 2022,negative,moved way too slow and was too long  left before it was over
May 19 2022,positive,a very climactic lorerich symbolystic and historically accurate depiction of early medieval europe  a captivating story about a young man robbed of his heritage forced to become a  monster to finally find regain his conscience and find redemption through sacrifice some scenes are too long but certainly not boring id love to see more films like that
May 19 2022,positive,a spellbinding movie with epic visuals and having a very dreamlike and mystical feel as well as being a brutal tale of bloody revenge
May 19 2022,positive,the best way to describe the northman would be an action revenge film custom made for art film audiences that will probably gratify both
May 19 2022,positive,not as exciting as i expected more of an art film still lovely nonetheless eggers amazes us once again
May 19 2022,positive,the northman is a bit of an acquired taste being more akin to an anthropologists wet dream or a tumultuous shroom trip than a standard blockbuster this brooding yet personable period piece is extremely faithful to the culture and worldview it depicts the northman is a mustsee in theatres
May 19 2022,positive,a great viking story  nothing like the viking tv show  less epic more atmospheric
May 19 2022,positive,so far the best viking age movie to date this is a grate look into norse sagas and lore if you want leather clad funky hair style hipster bikers look somewhere else but if you want a more accurate picture of norse life and how their stories were told this is perfect
May 19 2022,positive,great authentic raw footage
May 19 2022,negative,i dont know why people liked this garbage it was ridiculous after 15 minutes when they farted and burped in each others faces with the dog ritual scene then it shows the kid hanging by the back of his diaper then another dumb dog ritual scene when hes older not even 10 minutes later in the movie also these spirit guides just keep coming out of left field plus this film is really slow and without much guidance no thanks
May 19 2022,positive,it represents well all the nordic mythology but it was too bloody for my taste
May 19 2022,positive,braveheartish revenge movie for viking fans and those who love very cold scenes good acting all around and visually stunning at times brutal violence works in this genre
May 19 2022,positive,really enjoyed this movie
May 19 2022,positive,bgrade amateur writing and directing jazzed up with big bucks and blockbuster luster at a ridiculous 137 min long runtime and mostly stale pacing this film felt much longer particularly do to excessive use of nonsense filler with very little substance this may have been more entertaining as a short film    for starters i could barely understand the hardaccented vinglish nordicenglish let alone all the whatever the other languages were then add unnecessary nonsense cultlike singing and dancing and its borderline cringeworthy    the screenplay was underwhelming uninteresting and the narrative lazily written even the overbaked action scenes felt basic and cliched maybe the producers shouldve hired more experienced filmmakers    the cinematography was too dark to make sense of much during the night scenes the only good parts were the casting and performances although leaning towards a waste of talent and some breathtaking scenery and sets i dont even recall if there was a score in this film my frustration and impatience towards the story may have blocked that out andor it too was also underwhelming    this had so much more potential in the right hands ive youve seen the first two seasons of the vikings series this film will be a joke to you even with its blockbuster luster its a disappointing yet generous for its large production value 610 from me
May 19 2022,positive,the northman is a common revenge story that in the hands of robert eggers became a viking epic with a steady direction and stunning visuals eggers guides us through brutal and fantastical battles without losing the mystical essence of norse culture
May 18 2022,negative,ugh one of the dumber things ive seen this year even while fast forwarding this was slow almost a bmovie def not worth your time or money
May 18 2022,positive,thought the film would be all blood  guts it was but the story was so compelling very well written and acted the backdrop of iceland was so beautiful much better film than the recent denzel washington hamlet
May 18 2022,positive,absolutely fn epic  its funny if you look at a lot of the reviews on social media people either love or hate this film  thats usually a sign that its pretty good  no ones blasé about it  reminds me a lot of the original conan the barbarian when it came out in the early 80s bloody raw and full of mythology    its probably too violent for the art house folks and too artsy for the action people  but if you exist in both worlds this piece is solid gold
May 18 2022,positive,a great spectacle simplistic characters drive a straightforward plot with obvious twists that are surprisingly effective thanks to excellent execution the sound design visuals and gripping scenes made this movie phenomenal i am usually a hater especially of films with simple plots and characters but the sensory spectacle of this film won me over ill even forgive the weird little cgi fox
May 18 2022,neutral,i wanted to love this movie  i was looking forward to it  overall it was a massive let down  the artistry and visuals are fantastic  thats where the good ends    like others i feel like i understand where the story was trying to go but it never left the parking spot    the delivery of most of the story was very wooden and not engaging at all  i feel like there are an absolute load of scandinavian actors who couldve pulled the roles of kidman and hawk off a lot better and make it more believable    the first berserker battle scene felt lacking  maybe were all very spoiled by the adrenaline packed battle scenes from other series and movies but this was just very poorly done from a viewer standpoint  the only point in the movie where you actually care for and have any emotional reactions to the characters is when amleth and olga are on the boat to escape iceland and thats it    i was left feeling as though there shouldve been a lot more story to this one and maybe there was  it was just left in the backroom somewhere    im tempted to give this one another watch just to see if maybe itll catch me the second time around but at this point its left such a disappointing veil on the movie as whole i will probably wait a while before trying to muck my way through this again
May 18 2022,negative,after 2 years of remaining locked away from any blockbuster movies on massively big screens with earbursting sound and mindblowing cinematography and effects we finally crawl out of our caves with high hopes of reliving those incredible experiences we had at movie theaters in days gone by and i hope for your sake you read this review before you go see this movie or you may find yourself like us crawling back into our cave popping on friends or seinfeld reruns or just about anything that has the possibility of scrubbing what i just saw from my mind as fast as possible and hoping to never see anything like it again         i will make my case and point using only the scenes from the first 15 minutes of the movie but know that it only went downhill from there and not by a little         this epic saga about a small kingdom in the almost mythical viking culture opens with the battle weary but victorious king returning to his clan with spoils of gold and slaves and stories of conquering distant lands as all good viking movie should the scene seems to be building to something as the celebration unfolds within the grand hall while kin and clansman welcome the warriors home suddenly the jester takes center stage in front of the whole clan whips his garments aside gripped his manhood with his left hand which looked much more like a donkeys than a mans it was so over the top and then proceeds to slap it around with his right hand this my fellow viewers is hollywoods view of quality entertainment and what people want to see this is what eggers thought would represent a great opening scene that would set the tone for the rest of the movie unfortunately for the viewers it did ironically it turned out to be a very accurate metaphor of how the audience felt watching the rest of his movie         only a few minutes later we are taken into some ancient caves where we catch a glimpse into a secret right of passage where a king and father imparts his warrior spirit to his son so that he can lead their battlehardened tribe when his father is gone and the king is confronted with a moment to prove that he is not a mindless animal operating from instinct only but a dominant predator that takes what it wants and survives through prowess in battle when asked prove youre not a lowly dog the king digs deep into his soul and offers up the proof that sets this incredible conquering culture apart a deepthroated vibratofilled belch this is what eggers could think of to represent one of the greatest battle cultures of human history to be clear this is not a comedic moment but a ritualistic writ of passage that would seem was passed down through centuries of conquering ancestors and just when you thought it couldnt get any better the scene turns to the son its his moment in the light to receive his fathers greatness his cunning is wisdom is a king his predatory instincts to dominate in battle and the son is asked the same question prove that youre not a lowly dog but are a warrior so he digs deep so deep that he seems to wince in pain from the effort he grimaces clenches his eyes shut grits his teeth and rips a 5second longfart         are you kidding me this is what hollywood writing has come to it is actually sad that what could have been a decent storyline with the opportunity to portray an indepth historically accurate culture in human history was handed over to an aspiring beavis and butthead writer and director         i guess im the fool to think in todays society we could actually generate a storyline along the lines of braveheart the patriot or even more reasonable  or even just a shadow of the storyline from quigley down under would have been an exponential improvement over this garbage
May 18 2022,positive,true to the era of the viking lore
May 18 2022,positive,northman is a incredible epic history of vengance that explores perfectly the nordic mitology in my opinion is a great adventure with amazing ending  the northman is a masterpiece
May 18 2022,positive,an amazing movie that i would watch every week
May 18 2022,positive,i was looking forward to this what i got was crap conan i see where it was trying to go and get back to the old sword and sorcery  it just didnt get there   the plot was simple to kill the guy that killed his dad and took his mother   i get the mother part after watching which i wont spoilor did i lol   but it was a lot of him sneaking around killing other people and not the one he should of taken out 20 mins into the movie then he could of had a better adventure for us to watch   it was a passible few hours but doubt ill watch again
May 18 2022,negative,while i did enjoy the movie more after seeing a second time i still found a lot of the same problems yes the imagery is outstanding unfortunately the script and depth of the characters was lacking after 2 hours we should love or hate the characters with the exception of anya taylor and hawk i was left feeling nothing of importance as far as getting meat in the plot its a vegan sandwich see in theaters or you may find yourself playing on your phone some have been suggesting that the film is geared for higher intelligence i would the films is getting the score it deserved from the audience
May 18 2022,positive,a perfect movie if you love historical time pieces and vikings this is the movie for you this is essentially a more grounded real and violent version of the lion king robert eggers delivers with historical accuracy raw acting and beautiful set pieces in a time of superhero films and remakes this movie stands out highly recommend
May 18 2022,positive,unique and introspective look at the quintessential revenge story of hamlet it wont be for everyone but i love it
May 18 2022,positive,this is a near perfect film any flaws or imperfections are most likely found by the viewer through bias and ignorance on their part it reinforces a rule ive had for decades now if bjork comes out of the woodwork to act in something its probably amazing this film is speaking of bjork shes amazing as is the rest of the cast there are no chinks in the armor of this warrior film from writing to acting from cinematography to direction this is a near perfect film i say near perfect because personally i felt pacing was a tad bit slow this is as i said before a personal issue i watch and review a lot of films so even with a gem like this i can get impatient having said that this film delivers on every other front for me its really a tour de force of film making it doesnt straddle but rather gracefully struts along the line of realistic period piece and mystical fantasy statement piece pefectly seriously this is one of those special films where the all star cast matches the top shelf writing dont sleep on this one watch it now
May 18 2022,positive,superb movie well acted and action packed most importantly historically accurate and not ruined by politically correct bias i believe it is based on the same norse historian shakespeare used for hamlet    that would be my one caveat its a little arty  not at all a cartoonish marvel type production so if thats what you like it might not be for you personally i loved it
May 18 2022,negative,got up and left after an hour bored
May 18 2022,positive,the film contains excellent visual storytelling hallucinogenic trips interspersed with magical realism in a wonderful location which eggers put to good use with his sequence shots and precise choreography    the overall story is predictable but what the director is offering here is the journey itself rather than the final destination    there are brutal and raw passages typical of the untamed viking nature but there are also poetic dialogues making it all a beautiful and visceral epic    the performances are very good mainly highlighting skarsgard kidman and björk    the soundtrack is also impressive leveling neck and neck with the poetically bloody spectacle of the viking vendetta    on the downside i could say that considering the cast its almost a nobrainer that the northman is an englishlanguage movie but robert eggers could have been even more meticulous and followed the good example of mel gibson who often incorporates the language of the culture exhibited in the film as the main language it will continue to bother me every time i see the beginning of a film as promising as this one with an unbeatable setting and photography set in a time and place foreign to english speakers but which is irremediably spoken in english worse still if it is english with a foreign accent as if the characters had learned english only to show themselves on the screen and hide the fact of the dialectical imposition    but aside from the above the northman is an epic film from conception to delivery regurgitating a wild grudge story like its characters with very few flaws and sure to be the best ive seen this year    totally recommended to see when children and people with sensitive stomachs have gone to sleep
May 18 2022,negative,so all over the place
May 18 2022,negative,not even close to vikings or last kingdom  not worth it
May 18 2022,positive,this movie was amazing the story line and the cinematography were amazing im about to go make all my friends watch this movie
May 18 2022,positive,enjoyable and kept my interest throughout the whole movie the northman is more accessible than eggers previous movies the witch and the lighthouse in my opinion overall a good time
May 18 2022,positive,sometimes difficult to understand
May 18 2022,positive,this third featurelength outing from robert eggers finds the cowriterdirector at his most accessible and  i think  his most creative the northman takes all of the universal appeal around the revenge story injects it with eggerss penchant for brutality his eye for stunning imagery both beautiful and horrific and his incredible ability to evoke whatever period he sees fit to depict wrapping it all up in the ever so faint trappings of an ohso classic shakespearean tale were ultimately gifted with an unforgettably satisfying sort of protohamlet featuring an unquestionably dedicated cast some truly breathtaking set pieces and the thematic intangibles of a truly special cinematic experience altogether i really really had a great time with this and think its easily eggerss most enjoyable flick to date
May 18 2022,positive,the northman is everything you want in a viking era type movie i thought in the beginning it would be ho hum another the uncle did it but it was far from that wow the imagery is awesome the music is intense and the acting is superb
May 18 2022,positive,this movies was an incredible masterpiece but it attracted the wrong viewers just like what happened with birdman in 2014 nicole kidman shouldve not been in this movie tho
May 18 2022,neutral,too pretentious tried too hard to make a 60s sword  sandal flick into an artsy one a la 300 or a 50s shakespearean play especially the beginning bit with ethan hawke ended up looking like a school childrens play
May 18 2022,positive,phenomenal so many layers to this film that leaves you with a lot to think about on top of it being masterfully made with incredible shots and fantastic performances a worthy successor to eggers previous masterwork the lighthouse
May 18 2022,positive,i thought it was good entertainment 
May 17 2022,negative,this was one of the worst movies i have seen i was embarrassed about the plot
May 17 2022,positive,awesome movie man the line is perfect
May 17 2022,positive,a typical revenge flick that falls flat on character development some cool actions sequences and incredible scenery but i didnt find myself invested in the characters at all
May 17 2022,negative,this movie is best described as a viking soap opera with lots of hate betrayal and blood not worth the time  the plot is horrible the king is killed by his brother who steals his wife and tries to kill the son tthe son grows up and tries to rescue his mother who says she hates him and tries to seduce him  it only gets worse from there   save your self some time and money  skip this movie
May 17 2022,positive,great acting great excitement beautiful cinematography
May 17 2022,positive,love how harsh and weird this movie is my movie of the year so far
May 17 2022,positive,good movie kinda slow in places 
May 17 2022,positive,eggers made it again brining a film that has everything needed to be great story music cinematography performances and direction   i cant say anything wrong about the northman
May 17 2022,positive,just didnt keep me interested all the time
May 17 2022,negative,a plodding dull disappointing film     father murdered son forced into servitude of course hell become the greatest warrior ever    man ordered to murder child doesnt do it  and lies about it like in snowhite   hero gets magic sword what the f wasnt that   spooky seerfortune teller yeah yeah   slaves in designer linen costumes nice   warrior roaring staring angrily at the camera or moodily at the ground alexander skarsgård cant do a lot more    feisty servant girl love interest to illustrate the caring side of the brute and facilitate a sex scene   choreographed dancers culturally appropriating viking ritual dancing to bongos around the campfire   themes and set pieces borrowed from vikings the tv show and game of thrones and better executed and explored    inconsistent sonorous thick accents from an international cast of actors when they can be arsed   dodgy cgi that tree was especially shit all the money must have gone on the cast     dark and monochromatic cinematography but you have to see it on a big screen in the cinema hah     its vikings for gods sake  they could have done it without the marvelbuffy level supernatural twaddle  they could have invented a better revenge motive  eggers of all people could have made it creepy instead of generic  the cgi could have been better  and f the historical accuracy bjork wearing a fan couldnt they have had at least one horned helmet because its vikings for gods sake    go see valhalla rising or vikings on tv theyre way better
May 17 2022,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed this i found it enthralling captivating and emotionally raw and authentic a mustsee
May 17 2022,positive,a esthetic scenarstic and visual madness 
May 17 2022,positive,i found allot of it just plain weird  visuals were pretty awesome  i couldnt stop watching but i wouldnt watch it again
May 17 2022,positive,dark brooding and brutal  this film was a work of art  it was not your typical pace of epic  it was more personal and harsh  if you expect the typical tale of viking plunder and pillage theres some of that but mostly about one mans struggle to reconcile his past
May 17 2022,positive,excellent visuals and actingthe story is sometimes slow but is interesting how the portrait the folkrore and believes of the time also it breaks with the kingqueen love stories we are used to watch
May 17 2022,positive,visually mindblowing a revenge movie like no other
May 17 2022,positive,so unique and amazing acting
May 17 2022,negative,it was low budget and the story ripped pieces and tropes from a dozen other movies and shows     there were a few moments i thought it would pick up and get to the point but it really never did    casting was ok but with no real plot and no real budget where could it go     1 star for gore 1 star for attempting a show about a northman
May 17 2022,positive,this movie takes itself very seriously resulting in some pretentious dialogue here and there  however the visuals are stunning there is plenty of action and the characters seem authentically historical not like 21st century people plunked down in the 10th
May 17 2022,positive,wow not for the average idiot incredible work of art 
May 17 2022,negative,avoid like the plague worst movie of the year great cast horrible script the trailer was better than the movie 
May 17 2022,negative,dont see this i was charged twice 60 and was most definitely not worth it plot had no meat no juice was a barren dessert that i have seen before camera work was cool or whatever   but not worth my time nor mula  also there were not one not two but seven different babies crying in the theater is this ebven a kids movie i brought my wife of 4 months there as a potential romantic outing she loves this crud but even she didnt enjoy thank you for showing us what a mid move looks like i dont enjoy the fee for it also i was told no movie distractions by a man who greted me on the big screen walberg or williamsburg or something who told me no babies why were their so many young children big ls this movie took
May 17 2022,negative,this movie is worthy of being featured on mst3k  im not even kidding  it was the most cliché bloody awful drivel ive seen in years  the cinematography was good though     youre much better off watching the last kingdom for your viking fix
May 16 2022,positive,the lawrence of arabia  benhur of this century if you watch one movie in 2022 it need be this
May 16 2022,positive,p bussin frfr no cap
May 16 2022,positive,very much a robert eggers film also very much an entertaining movie the visuals are gorgeous and the story doesnt require you to focus too much on plot which isnt a putdown its a bit of a greater than the sum of its parts deal even though the individual pieces of this film are quite good you see which way the wind is blowing pretty early on and from there its a sensory sort of experience i very much enjoyed the northman and im excited to see what eggers tries his hand at next
May 16 2022,positive,another great movie from robert eggers this movie is all around amazing highly recommended
May 16 2022,positive,i enjoyed it but thought it couldve been a 4 hrs epic and the story delved a little deeper
May 16 2022,positive,a brutal work a big hit
May 16 2022,positive,loved this movie watched it with my wife and we were both enamored its a fantastic movie great characters atmospheric storytelling great action scenes really hits you over the head with its atmosphere and vibe great acting outstanding visuals and sounds probably one of the best viking type movies ever made     this movie really follows in line with his others  the lighthouse the vwitch etc so i would say if you dont like those you will probably feel the same about this movie its not entirely straightforward i personally am surprised at all the negative audience reviews i think the issue is that if you go into this movie expecting a film like gladiator or braveheart type movie you will be dissapointed it does take some thinking expect lots of ambiguous trippy spiritual story telling that fills out the narrative weird visuals scenes of psychedelic mushrooms use etc you cant take it all at face value you have to be ready to sort of interpret some things for your self i personally love it it also does have some kick ass fighting i see some users saying the fighting was slow but to me it just seemed more real and grounded brutal and very memorable movie
May 16 2022,negative,just a bunch of men screaming at each other hissing and spitting like rapid raccoons is this what we call great acting now the dialogue bordered on comedy or parody the overly oedipal scene gasp your sword is so long had me laughing out loud
May 16 2022,positive,vikings sword fight  loin cloths and less five stars no matter what
May 16 2022,positive,well made interesting to see the relations between viking and rus
May 16 2022,positive,clearly an epic what a treat this was visually and emotionally stunning please watch
May 16 2022,negative,hands down worst movie of the 21st century avoid like hell
May 16 2022,negative,great acting great framing but lazy writing nothing engaging from start to finish
May 16 2022,negative,not sure what the critics were watching but this conan knock off was beyond boring  when i see critic reviews like this and the film is this bad it only goes to prove the film makers are paying off the critics  awful dialog  acting was equally horrible  plotless drivel
May 16 2022,positive,this movie is not for the people who watch cbm movies this is something on an entirely different level i didnt see such a spectacular film in years 1010 visually  1010 acting wise 1010 story wise one of the best movies i have ever seen period
May 16 2022,negative,i dont know why the media has such a hardon for robert eggers  i saw the witch when it first came out at a screening in my town and eggers was there to do a qa after  i thought the movie was boring and he was a huge pretentious douche   the northman is more of the same  its like if the biggest dumbest jock you knew in high school took lsd one day and decided to go to film school  then give that idiot 90 million and hell make something like this  it was a flashy testosterone dripping black metal album cover with zero character depth  it took me two nights to finish my pirated copy i was so bored
May 16 2022,neutral,1st half good 2nd not so good
May 16 2022,positive,at first i thought it was some lion king story but the twist in the 3rd act really brought out emotions i didnt realize i had
May 16 2022,negative,the northman is a hard to watch bloody revenge tale that unfortunately wastes a perfectly fine cast
May 16 2022,negative,the visuals and sound tracks were pretty epic thats about all this film has going for it    the fight scenes are slow and lumbering 90 of normal humans are dodging half of the slow blatantly choreographed fight scenes     the plot was also so telegraphed that i could basically predict the ending by about 10 minutes was hoping for much more left well disappointed     modern movies seem to focus only on the visuals sound and action this fell flat needed much more character development throughout which is a lost art apparently
May 16 2022,negative,a terrible movie  stupid shakesperean misplaced dialog  goofy caveman dancing  a cross of the movies grease and avatar  beware this king in yellow
May 16 2022,negative,this may be lovely to look at but the northman ends up being a ponderous mess with terrible accents  worse fight scenes  avoid
May 16 2022,negative,f who ever give above zero one rate to this movie what the f was this movie story characters actions  what is happening in hollywood shiiiiit
May 16 2022,negative,the northman is a 2022 american epic historical fiction film directed by robert eggers      oof this isnt good   probably give it a miss     conquer your fate
May 16 2022,negative,this movie was a complete waste of time  if you liked the three eyed ravens scenes in got and want to live in 2 hours of those scenes than this movie can be for you  but if you arent interested in a 2 hour psychedelic trip that ultimately has no point save your time and skip this movie  i think this is one of those movies where the critics are gaga over it because it is art but in reality it is just a bad movie
May 16 2022,positive,i thought theyve stopped making movies like this     its a one of those classic that many people may not even see but its a great epic movie comparable to braveheart troy etc
May 16 2022,positive,i read a review that said this was a beast of a movie accurate description a little weird sometimes but visually stunning
May 16 2022,negative,total complete and utter rubbish  i could have been watching paint dry instead of seeing this
May 16 2022,positive,make yourself a favor and watch this movie
May 16 2022,neutral,when i saw mornius it was a movie sneak preview for this northman and in the sneak preview fr the movie it looked like the northman was turning into the dog with his friends and i told albert we should see the movie because i saw the dog part and the noetham was howling  so alvert came to the mall movies with me and britney after he called us and said he could come that night and when the movie came on it was too dark but then there was the part when they were pretending to be dogs together and all the friends were barking like dogs together and i said albert i told you it was in the movie  i didnt thin theee was a long enough scene with the dogs because thats why i came to the mall movies and i didnt want to be in barrassed in front of britnwy shes was confused why there were birds coming in doing what the dogs should be doing and i said yeah if i knew that from the movie sneak preview i would have told us that moebius was more fun with the bat scenes because there were more 
May 16 2022,positive,the northman b  the film does an impressive job in terms of camera work world building and creating an overall atmosphere you could sense the brutalness of the world coming through very strongly and it gave many gritty moments that help illustrate a very specific tone i thought using a grittier tone for a movie about vikings was a great choice and i appreciate how consistent to this tone the movie followed there is something special about the way the scenes are shot especially the action scenes many instances where a scene has extra attention to detail on the fight choreography or way a person may actually react to the fight taken place was done with what appears to be expert care    alexander skarsgård is a brutal vengeance filled warrior who is trying to take back what was rightfully his for much of the beginning of the film he is shown as a warrior who will stop at nothing to avenge his dead father and rescue his mother from the man responsible for his pain i really appreciate and was surprised by the focus later in the film to show more sides to this character than just his brutalness and that the character actually has motives and a heart anya taylorjoy does a good job here of bringing a sense of lightness to the world of skarsgårds character and adds to some of the mythology of vikings by bringing sorcery into the movie also i would be remised to not bring to attention how great nicole kidman did at bringing a very dynamic character to the screen all in all very good acting choices were made here    i mentioned before the atmosphere in this film is prominently felt i attribute this in no small part to robert eggers who directed this film he had a certain vision for this film and you just have to appreciate how meticulous he was at bringing that vision about there were a few instances i noticed where eggers purposely pronounces a shot more or holds on to a reaction from a character longer these subtle personal tweaks by the director show how much he cared about the story being told in the way he wanted it to    with this film you have to understand that it isnt a film that is trying to expand your mind to many new concepts it is a simple tale that has been told in many different formats before but this time in its own special way with a pretty straightforward plotline of a revengeful son the movie did supply a unique twist during the end that helped propel the movie in a few unpredictable directions i will say that during watching the movie there were a few specific scenes that were put at such epic scenes very bluntly that it made it feel a little disorienting i would have also preferred to see just a few more action scenes in the middle section of the film as the beginning and end have some really well designed action scenes but the middle doesnt see much of this    fans of epic action movies like gladiator or 300 will find a lot they enjoy here it may not be the most revolutionary plot ever but it succeeds on many fronts as far as getting the story across in an unique yet effective style northman may just be the movie you have been waiting for if you like the trailers you see for it or are someone who just likes being transported to the era it is based in
May 16 2022,positive,enjoyable movie my only complaints are that the plot was sometimes difficult to follow and the acting was overdone in a few parts
May 16 2022,positive,felt to me like an icelandic saga on the big screen which is a breath of fresh hair the visuals are awesome the soundtrack is great and the dialogue is anything but bland    im no expert bu this did not feel like a hackneyed charicature of old norse culture    in short i liked it
May 16 2022,positive,great film good watch pretty brutal but great depiction of norse life around the 9th century
May 16 2022,negative,do not spend your valuable with this it is not worth the time
May 16 2022,negative,too graphic for my taste and as an animal lover the savage killing of the horses really offended me
May 16 2022,negative,had high hope for this movie it was incredibly boring drawnout and terrible plot
May 16 2022,negative,too long too loud movie too dark i walked out halfway through the movie couldnt even understand what they were saying  i would like my money back
May 16 2022,positive,one of the best storytelling movies ive seen in the modern age
May 16 2022,negative,the most gratuitously violent and hopless movie ive ever seen its loosely based on hamlet but without shakespeares prose i wish i had walked out
May 16 2022,positive,best viking movie ever made a mystical and violent saga with great acting and superb cinematography
May 16 2022,positive,too much yelling hard to follow plot
May 16 2022,negative,incredibly long and drawn out  the way they had alexander skarsgard  of whom i am a fan beefed up made him hunch over and look a bit like quasimodo the story was ok and a few plot twists but would probably wait til it was on free tv if i had it to do over
May 16 2022,negative,not as great as people keep saying    the first great sin is that the movie has no real heart nobody feels or acts like an actual human being the characters were all shallow caricatures who reacted in no way a real human would to much of what happens too much of the dialogue was also artsy fartsy nonsense that led from one place to another with me constantly asking where dreams and hallucinations stopped and reality began one moment youre supposed to accept that he has hallucinations and delusions masking as visions which is a nice touch but then everything from these weird visions turns out to be real what how does that work and dont call it a mystic element as if that excuses flimsy consistency it doesnt a story with no consistent logic can have all the esoteric scenes it likes its still shoddy writing    the biggest sin however is not using its clever twist as the story went on i began to think that we were actually seeing a movie from the bad guys side without knowing it and without the plot really telling us then comes the reveal hes a child born of a loveless marriage set on vengeance fuelled by delusions of prophecy and royalty the start of the movie gives a clue showing hes just a savage berserker with little regard for life or humanity then his acts of vengeance turn into clearly monstrous acts of violence and later  as far as im concerned  madness and delusions you slowly begin to take the other guys side and by the end its pretty clear that the protagonist is a monstrous villain who in any other movie would be the bad guy who needs to be slain    but the movie doesnt play to this strength it seems to try and keep the audience on his side even as he clearly loses his mind and it has some weird ending that seems to show his fulfilling ending maybe youre supposed to deduce that the movie sticks with the bad guy until the end and thats how he sees his own death a glorious ride to valhalla while in reality he just murdered a bunch of people out of spite and hate and then drops dead but thats not much to go on and again its so muddled and in the background that its barely there to work with    mediocre and unfulfilling
May 16 2022,negative,wow  life is short  dont waste it watching this trash  its not art  its not entertainment  its some sort of ego trip to nowhere  dont step on board
May 16 2022,negative,doing too much in a basic revenge story  what could have been a more simple revenge story where the estranged son returns with a new wife and children on the way frees his mother from his tyrant uncle  instead you have some fake magic based upon mushrooms and a more complicated story where the father of the protagonist was killed for being a bad husband  then there is a bad fight scene by a volcano where the protagonist is able to catch his breath then fight the bad guy on his terms  this is bad story telling full of bad clichés and just not engaging  i want my ticket price back
May 15 2022,negative,really bad acting cheap sets and it really dragged on and on predicable plot
May 15 2022,negative,too long too slow some fights scenes looked like a stage play that said the twist in the plot with kidman was unexpected caught me off guard additionally alexander skarsgård was intense focused and in phenomenal shape
May 15 2022,negative,good lordsuch a great cast and suck a horrible storyline   ughh dont waist your time not even worth watching it on cable
May 15 2022,negative,if the following makes sense to you then see this movie with spoilers     say you were a slave to a small viking colony in iceland in 962 ad and your masters were all killed would your next move be to burn all the buildings at the settlement in a rampage so you could live in the elements     in the final fight scene two experienced fighters battle to the death naked among lava flows so youd take off your chain mail and boots next to 2800 degree molten rock and youd just figure your opponent would do the same just because of some viking honor i will tell you why this scene was shot like thisbecause lava looks good on film     this film is nonsensical
May 15 2022,negative,not impressed i should have watched vikings series again better storyline better acting and better cinematography
May 15 2022,negative,such high hopes this movie was absolutely awful so much rich material to make an epic adventure movie hollywood simply cannot make a good movie any more i love these types of movies and this was just weird from the start story and flow of movie was a complete travesty i wanted to walk out of the movie several times so very disappointing
May 15 2022,positive,this film is a good mix of realism and parable nordic mythology and unflinching period action its in english but thats not where its westernization ends i was hoping to see lesser known scandinavian actors but got ethan hawke and nicole kidman both were distractions from the realistic tone the rest of the cast was solid the action is top notch and skarsgard makes for a great beast of a viking raider its different so dont go expecting a viking rambo movie
May 15 2022,neutral,i absolutely love eggers the witch and was hoping for something as amazing with the northman the cinematography is good the story is simple but not too bad and the acting is decent but nothing came together very disappointing i also kept getting distracted by the unintentionally funnycheesy scenes the first couple times it didnt bother me but by the fifth or the sixth time it got to be too much i know eggers is a great director and that he will make better films in the future but this one was just a big disappointment it felt like a film student was given a lot of money and a talented crew to make a movie i might just rewatch valhalla rising again to get this movie out of my mind
May 15 2022,positive,loved it saw it twice makes you wanna fight d
May 15 2022,neutral,too much nordic mythology totally unnecessary 
May 15 2022,negative,horrible long and drawn out save money and time my family saw this with me my wife walked out and my 2 boys gave it an f
May 15 2022,positive,the northman stands out for its authenticity in bringing norse mythology and history to life and thanks to the production and sound design results in some captivating moments which wouldve however been even better if the  occasionally kitsch  dialogues were in old norse rather than english storywise its a standard predictable familiar revenge tale save for perhaps the twist which brings up some interesting enduring points although sadly the film moves past it pretty quickly
May 15 2022,negative,the aquaman of vikings
May 15 2022,negative,first ill start with a good thing about the movie it had good sound  next a bad everything else  just a silly movie that wont be remembered in the long run 
May 15 2022,positive,brutal and beautiful best movie of the year
May 15 2022,negative,it was confusing and the ending was a disapointment all that and he dies wtf
May 15 2022,negative,so boring could hardly watchit lacks everything that makes a film interestingstory is thin no character development plastic acting is film industry in self destruct mode
May 15 2022,negative,ultraviolent no real character or story development
May 15 2022,negative,one of the worst movies i have ever seen i tried to give it a chance but after an hour i had to walk out what a load of absolute rubbish do not watch this tripe slow bad acting bad action scenes this movie has absolutely nothing going for it i would be embarrassed being associated with it rather paint your walls and watch the paint drythat will be more entertaining than watching this movie
May 15 2022,negative,now granted i missed the first 5 minutes of the movie but this is just the worst thing ever put on film even vikings should be embarrassed by this horrible waste of time i bet nicole kidman was forced to do this 
May 15 2022,positive,best movie about vikings ever
May 15 2022,positive,the ending was not good for me all that talk he was doing and still end up dead
May 15 2022,positive,it had a lot of action
May 15 2022,positive,this movie was really welcoming to people who are interested in vikingspaganism this isnt your everyday movie you will witness things as ritualsnordic religion an absolute must see
May 15 2022,positive,why does this movie have such high ratings why even have actors thatll well known in it the movie was basically garbage the story was ridiculously bad some action scenes were ok honestly i dont even have anything good to say 510 is being generous
May 15 2022,positive,such an amazing movie i highly recommend it if you love movies that take you back to a time you can only read about than this is it its a heroic story and it had some surprising twists in it overall i would watch it again
May 15 2022,negative,beautiful cinematography violence and gore cant compensate for plot
May 15 2022,negative,i know it rated 86  but im sorry  what a formulaic trope piece of junk  we know enough about the history of the norse or the vikings as people refer to them to know that they were not like this  this presentation of their society is a creation of hollywood and this example doubles down on that more than most  im not going to tear it down or pretty much  say anything else about it  its just junk  dafoe kidman and anyone else of note did this for the easy paycheque post covid shutdown
May 15 2022,negative,slow boring with bad acting with mediocre and short storyline that was starched for more than two agonizing hours the only not  treble thing was is the camera recommended for insomniacs 
May 15 2022,positive,its rare to see a movie like this these days where the focus is on authenticity story and characters instead of social politics enjoyed this movie from start to finish the plot draws you in quickly and the fight scenes are also quite well done this was a refreshing piece of entertainment rarely seen these days
May 15 2022,positive,brilliant film a huge epic that deserves to be seen on the biggest screen possible hopefully the academy will remember this film come awards time because its worthy of best picture
May 15 2022,negative,sucked like all his movies just stupid to me and i looked fed to it all the same
May 15 2022,positive,great acting and directing although quite linear and predictable it does what you expect and there are few surprises
May 15 2022,positive,beautiful  brutal  and masterfully crafted in every way
May 15 2022,positive,not for most viewers  but then most viewers like their movies cookie cutter some spectacular old school outdoor settings and limited cgi great casting  gorgeous locations if youve seen eggers previous movies youll know to expect something a little off if you come into this expecting a run of the mill viking movie youll be disappointed try something  different for a change kiddies  its not all dinosaurs and capes out there 
May 15 2022,negative,dont seek it out but if youre forced to watch it or die an untimely death you will survive     lots of dancing and chanting by men in cowhide underwear so long so boring so disjointed so pointless
May 15 2022,positive,very fresh and innovative robert eggers proves once again how talented of a writer and director he is
May 15 2022,positive,great movie if not very violent it borrows heavily from hamlet but intertwines that with its own plot and references to king arthur and greek mythology great acting from the entire cast all in all a fantastic flick
May 15 2022,negative,if youre a fan on historical viking movies you will be disappointed the movie was boring and lacked excitement missed opportunities to really capture audience
May 15 2022,negative,horrible a waste of 1999 to rent it the acting was barley average the dialogue was terrible the storyline was just ok overall it was all bad
May 15 2022,positive,wow epic movie they really dont make movies this well anymore quite the story to tell amazing
May 15 2022,positive,after taking a college course in viking history the northmen gave me a true feeling for what it was really like  from viking raids to sailing the north atlantic in their small wooden boats  as a young man the protagonist left denmark to sail with the swedish vikings called the rus rowers because they had to row the viking ships down the eastern european rivers to capture slavs enslave them and sell them in turkey  the slavs eventually tired of being sold into slavery and chose to make the swedish vikings their kings instead  that area eventually became russia  i can not get the movie out of my head  quite possibly the most realistic movie ive ever seen
May 15 2022,negative,the 15 stars are for mr skarsgård just because he showed up to film basically just a mindless romp of violence and bloodshed  not very engaging at all  not very realistic or sensible plot the 15 hours it takes you to get through this movie  if you do  might be better spent reading a dictionary or taking a bubble bath
May 15 2022,negative,i watched it according to the high reviews on rotten tomato and the others honestly its one of the worst ive seen a lot of mistakes in the scenes and week story telling
May 15 2022,negative,wow its been a while since i sat through such a bad movie the acting was extraordinarily bad and the accents
May 15 2022,positive,action packed movie with a lot of adventure not a movie for kids 16 is okay the actors did a great job go see this movie
May 15 2022,positive,the plot was incredibly cliché and predictable there was some pretty nice visuals though
May 15 2022,positive,some people are just afraid to see the savage truth of some of our ancestors  its not all rainbows and unicorns sweethearts
May 15 2022,negative,this movie was so bad i think it gave me cancer
May 15 2022,negative,i love viking clanged bangers but this was derivative pointless poorly acted and had no originality
May 15 2022,positive,definitely worth seeing  big screen for a big story
May 15 2022,positive,great movie very realistic
May 15 2022,positive,perfect viking mythology and tragic greek movie
May 15 2022,positive,if your expectation is a straighforward action movie with a nordic background this movie will subvert your expectations the northman is a mostly historically accurate movie that has beautiful scenery excellent cinematography and a gripping story it had to watch it twice to truly get it but once i did it became one of my favorite films from the last five years
May 15 2022,negative,no plot line trying to hard to be the revenant
May 15 2022,negative,this movie really sucked the whole movie was weak a waste of time and money
May 15 2022,positive,a perfect tale of the viking age culture and religion with an artistic flair i feel it is a much better representation than even the television series i love
May 15 2022,negative,ummmm it was too mythical awkward too much witchcraft and very predictable
May 15 2022,negative,painfully long with odd twists of fantasy mixed with realityjust a really strange movie and i can see why the audience score is significantly lower than the critics
May 15 2022,negative,poor acting  no comparison to the last kingdom and the vikings sorely disappointed dont waste your money dozed off twice
May 15 2022,negative,dark depressing dumb and painfully boring at one point i literally fell asleep after about an hour and 20 minutes i actually walked out i went to see this movie because i had enjoyed director robert eggers first two featurelength films the witch and the lighthousei especially liked the witchbut the northman was a real bomb several actorsethan hawke nicole kidman and the mystifyingly often overrated willem defoe acted as if they didnt really know what the director wanted from them awful awful awful
May 15 2022,positive,this movie was very intense if your into movies like that then id reccomend it can also be very disturbing and hard to watch at times the grittiness of the movie is what made it for me but not everyone is into that stuff
May 15 2022,positive,very good but not great the northman have all the elements that turn this kind of movie a classic eggers bring something more mainstream and acessible but also bring something linear without any real surprise if you watched tv shows like vikings the last kingdom vikings vahalla even others kind of series like spartacus you see something very similar here the different is that the acting of alexander and nicole bring something great to the table also the direction of eggers and the unique visual speak for themselves providing northman good moments of action violence and revenge overall its a very good cinematic experience but not an epic one
May 14 2022,negative,what a dissapointment incredibly weird and unaccurate representation of vikings theres no natural story progression when they want to progression they just throw in a random ass trippy scene with someone saying now you need to go to this place and do this
May 14 2022,positive,thoroughly enjoyed this film  northman is a gritty and raw move that is well directed and wonderfully shot  the themes are honest and respectful of the time period as well as the norsepagan elements it draws upon  an classic hamletesq movie of filial vengeance alexander skarsgard brings a blood thirsty warrior to life to avenge his father played by ethan hawk after his uncle played by claes bang murders him for the thrown  the movie at times feels small and intimate but then epic and broad    one major disappointment i found with the movie was the inclusion of bjork  there is never a good reason to include bjork but beyond that my grievance is that she is included to the dismissal of countless artists working in folk music to resurrect honest traditional sounds from the age of vikings  this sound track and casting should have been full of amazing artists like danheim heilung wardruna einar selvik yes he should be in here twice aurora and others who are examplars of historic icelandicscandenavian folk music while bjork whos relevance hasnt existed since the nineties is more known for music that sounds like so man tortured kittens on vinyl    minus one star for bjork
May 14 2022,negative,was way too long and drawn out
May 14 2022,negative,boring too long bad acting too many concepts at the same time no surprises
May 14 2022,negative,slow wierd waste of time
May 14 2022,negative,watching the trailer and reading the critic reviews i thought this was going to be a more intense version of the vikings show however this is a slow artistic form of a movie with not that many action scenes and poor story writing   the movie is too long and confusing at times i should have passed on this and watched something else
May 14 2022,positive,always a pleasure to see alexander skarsgård on the big screen
May 14 2022,negative,it didnt grab me the viking theme gets repetitive i did not like it maybe ill try it again doubt it i disconnected from it after 20 minutes or so
May 14 2022,negative,one of the worst films i have ever seen watch vikings this is so bad
May 14 2022,positive,awesome movie from the begging you can get your eye off the screen a must watch movie
May 14 2022,positive,visually stunning and the score is amazing pure eggers though the plot is straightforward with small twists shakespearean comes to mind  would watch over and over
May 14 2022,negative,so boring was hard to follow
May 14 2022,positive,the movie is great  watch it  it has low magic similar to game of thrones
May 14 2022,positive,great movie i love the way this movie express the reality 9010
May 14 2022,negative,never get back the time i spent on this crap movie no lavish movie financially put it in the toilet and flush
May 14 2022,negative,it started out like a viking version of the lion king which held promise but the rest was really slow moving and the good twist you were waiting for never came this films reminiscent of the magical realism seen in pans labyrinth so if that was a bit too artsy for your liking id give this a miss
May 14 2022,negative,simply a waste of time and money
May 14 2022,negative,poor character development scant dialogue and relies on prior knowledge of viking culture and history to follow the plot  many references to the superior series vikings
May 14 2022,neutral,i was expecting got like but no it was definitely not i would not tell anyone to go see this movie hollywood writers need help where did all the great movie writers go  we now get redone movies part 2345 etcand b rated ugh
May 14 2022,negative,the northman is definitely not for everyone the people are very cruel and savage weird and extreme rituals like howlingbarking however it actually lacked big action scenes there were only a few somewhat small action sequences in the movie the only good thing in this movie was the artistic cinematography thats it not much character development as well
May 14 2022,neutral,i guess i expected something like that of got level
May 14 2022,negative,pretty disappointed with this film hard to understand the dialogue
May 14 2022,negative,so disappointing i love alexander skarsgard but this was just all of the shop rubbish the two stars was for the amazing body of alexander skarsgård
May 14 2022,positive,good one great cinematography believable characters interesting environment i thought it lacked a bit in the story which got me bored around 23 of the duration but i never thought of stop viewing at times it reminded me of valhalla rising which i absolutely loved overall great and unique experience
May 14 2022,negative,i was somewhat engaged until the twist came near the end then i felt like the movie had no real stakes my reaction to the ending was huh ok the film left me feeling very empty none of the characters merited much investment and the screaming and violence was generally wearisome and almost cartoonish the hype around this movie would lead you to think this was going to be an epic multilayered tale of revenge but it felt very thin and shallow like the uncles kingdom consisted of maybe 40 people in a few huts in the middle of nowhere there isnt really a sense of grand scale in this and neither is there a sense of intimate deep character development
May 14 2022,positive,easily my favourite movie of the year doesnt force anything on the viewer it solidified eggers position on my list of favourite directors saying that this movie is not for the impatient or the fainthearted most people will hate it those with a genuine interest for arthouse films and accurate portrayal of history will love it for its attention to detail as much as the director does its brilliance will remain unappreciated i see this as a film which will bloom in the years following its release not a huge box office hit nor a criticallyacclaimed film
May 14 2022,negative,the movie was way to long and boring the story couldve been told sooner 
May 14 2022,negative,the story i slow and lacking  the movie cant really decide what kind of story it wants to tell which in turn just creates a lot of slow paced interactions with sudden bursts of action without any really relevance beyond a seemingly need for gore    if you on a flight and theres nothing else to watch itll pass the time  anything beyond that would be a waste of your time
May 14 2022,negative,super loud weird and gory which might be ok but not if thats all youve got it seemed to have glanced a plot no depth to the storyline but great scenery and costumes
May 14 2022,negative,the first 30 or so minutes was okay i thought it needed time to develop the story by the first hour i was getting restless the last 30 minutes i could not wait for it to finish this couldve been a decent movie if it came out in the 90s
May 14 2022,negative,dont waste your money there are a hundred episodes of vikings vikings valhalla or last kingdom that are each better than this screaming nonstop bloodfested snoozer
May 14 2022,positive,beautifully violent and aggressive almost animalistic in nature almost mirroring the animalism of the lead character
May 14 2022,positive,the northman is a movie with wasted potential a new work by the new but already cult director robert eggers has a fantastic direction but a common script with motivations that do not excite full of cliché curves that combine with weak performances  the cast of the northman is fantastic on paper but on screen we dont have delivery charisma or a performance capable of keeping the character not that the work is poorly acted its just that the performances dont follow the epic mood that the work tries to show this is directly linked to the script that brings us a classic revenge story full of mysticism and prophecies something weve seen for years in the series vikings  on the other hand robert eggers direction is very exciting with very few cuts long and sequential shots eggers knows very well how to use his camera making small traveling and positioning at low angles in order to enhance visual aspects of his feature such as costumes  makeup choreography music and photography these last two that are excellent by the way with a very cold blue photography and a soundtrack that matches the context of the work using high tones and a sensational sound mix it is also worth mentioning the framing always looking for an artistic touch almost like a painting robert eggers in his works has an unusual theme the horror that takes place in an isolated environment all his films have this theme in the background but here the horror doesnt work the suspense is weak and we have an action movie 710
May 14 2022,positive,savage authentic horrifying and just plain awesome viking movie which is a brilliant combination of the excellent tv show the vikings conan the barbarian and braveheart with a  shakespearean plot  stunning visuals  nicole kidman steals the movie acting wise  one of the best movies of all time
May 14 2022,negative,this is one of the worst movies i have ever sat through possibly one of the worst movies ever made it is an embarrassment to some really respectable actors there was a moment when i realized that this must be what the crows have eyes of schitts creek fame was like there is a heavy emphasis on the mystical to move the  paper thin story line along however there is no consistency in the visual effects culminating in a bizarre fairytale like look at the end of a supposed valkyrie riding up to i dont know heaven   good portions of it feel like a middle school play in which the kids werent give any direction for what they were supposed to be doing on the stage and other parts are so poor choreographed you have to wonder if the real villain was the films editor who possibly selected the worst takes and put them into the final edit in some effort to ruin the film this was just so bad
May 14 2022,negative,spend your money on netflix and watch the last kingdomexcellent viking historical show with a terrific cast  this was pretty boringand it sounded like the disney soundtrack from epcots norwegian ride  they tried to add in a bunch of mystical stuff but it was pretty silly  cant believe nicole kidman was in this or skaarsgard the whole audience was groaning and outside in the hallway afterward there was a group of 4 and the guy who picked this movie has his privileges revoked lol
May 14 2022,positive,i think my tlevels rose a bit watching this movie finally got to see this with my son and it was outstanding hes 15 and he really enjoyed it too
May 14 2022,positive,solid piece of filmmaking not for the faint of heart or those who have no patience
May 14 2022,positive,the movie is epic dark brutal and gory so its beautiful in staying true to the time period and civilizations  they certainly delved into the shamanism  savagery and spiritual mystery of the vikings and barbarian peoples of europe its got style and soul and goes all the way in establishing that its not just another mediocre bland film 
May 14 2022,positive,loved the display of nordic culture and the story was good enough to keep you invested felt like it was purposefully brutal which matches the tone of that era but also felt like it i wasnt as invested in the main character as much as i shouldve been the storyline with the mother was kind of a bummer finish and burned out too quickly
May 14 2022,positive,it is a viking version of hamlet with some great twists it is beautifully shot but also very violet as you would expect from a viking movie i highly recommend giving it a watch
May 14 2022,positive,it is a simple revenge story but told in a very intimate and creative way i found myself immersed in this world it was a ride one that will leave you thinking about your mortal fate
May 14 2022,neutral,so many elements to love and such a technical achievement with great acting having said that the plot felt messy and some of the stranger choices that were made just didnt work well together storywise by the final act i didnt feel invested in the characters at all even though it was a visual feast 
May 14 2022,negative,this had so much going for it i had a great time watching the first act but it lost me in the second and third act a viking movie about revenge and redemption but failed to deliver the second and third acts dragged on and had no satisfaction to the ending i dont understand how this movie was supposed to fulfill me at the end i just felt like my time was wasted on the long movie it feels empty no win no justification just a long  wasnt worth anything in the end a viking bear doesnt take revenge on his enemies the uncle that killed his father and the mother that betrayed him until its covenant for the the uncle and he doesnt even accomplished his goal
May 13 2022,negative,this has to be one of the worst movies ever made ever ever say it again ever you will find yourselves laughing at the stupidity of this movie
May 13 2022,negative,great sets and cinematography but ugh so dark character development felt weak is that the only possible plot for vikings revenge
May 13 2022,negative,absolute load of dribble probably one of the worst mainstream movies ive watched in a while  turned it off after saying a couple of times surely this is going to get better  little bit cringe
May 13 2022,positive,the northman is a visually stunning experience of viking epicness and probably one of the more accurate films on the entire subject matter while some dialogue can come across as complicated the story tells its own perfectly well
May 13 2022,positive,i was looking forward to watching this film for months and when i finally got to see it i have to say that it exceeded my already high expectations this viking revenge story is historically accurate with a layered storyline that builds on itself as the film progresses and makes sure to reward the viewer with an overall epic conclusion i found myself extremely invested in the characters and the story   if you are someone who enjoys history incredible visuals and badass action then i could not recommend this movie enough
May 13 2022,negative,very very long and slow movie it did have a good theme at the end but it took a long time to get there
May 13 2022,negative,everything about this movie was just bad as in poorly done as in done by inexperienced people or like 16 year olds trying to get away with pretending to know how to make a movie the clumsy shallowness and pretentiousness is searing  the directing is awful complete bmovie level and the script is worse bmovies can be engaging to watch this movie is not iits like watching a long boring trailer for a movie that never starts the only reason the audience score is as high as 63 right now is the hype the expectation a viking movie in 2022 with celebrities must be the best biking movie ever i thought this movie would be a break from the gloomy feeling you get thinking about how awful movies from hollywood have become the last couple of decades but it wasnt this movie is a new low for movies with celebrities in it
May 13 2022,positive,with a strong and stepbystep music faithtouching photography and art design and the stunning anya taylorjoy the epic blend of enchantment and realism the northman maintains robert eggers peculiar and spooky personality
May 13 2022,negative,really disappointed in this one did not like they magic in the movie it really didnt make a lot sense i had high expectations going into this one really glad i didnt pay at the theater
May 13 2022,positive,very different type of movie but it moved along well and kept your attention beautiful locations used for the film
May 13 2022,negative,too dark and depressing
May 13 2022,negative,for a movie that is 2 hours and 17 minutes long it seemed like it was closer to three hours long sequences that were just slow or not well written the time  line for the move is way offbut i leave that to others to discover if two decades elapse between the young prince leaving his until he returns then his mother was getting quite old when she conceived a second son  swimming to shore from a boat offshore iceland seriously the water is freezing  standingfighting within feet of flowing lava that is well over 1000 degrees fahrenheit nonsense  will not watch this movie again when it shows up on netflix
May 13 2022,negative,disappointed  i had such high hopes for a beautifully told and satisfying tale of revenge with the northman and all i got was a dark dreary and twisted art house spin on conan the barbarian  i dont care that this was supposedly written long ago thats what this was      by the time the film enters its final act a crazy twist nearly deflates all caring about what happens to its main character the investment of emotional weight was almost totally lost at least for me    beautiful cinematography  yes  good story  nope  this flick was so beyond unsatisfying from a story stand point maybe if i had some of those hallucinogenic mushrooms that were used in the film i would see this all differently  but sadly i was sober minded      in the end all i can say is this film just wasnt for me im not being pretentious here i get that others found high art and something to adore with the northman  but not me and thats ok  we all love and hate different things but i cant just pretend that this film did anything positive for me  i left the theater feeling emptiness    now ill sit down and smile my ass through conan for kroms sake
May 13 2022,negative,i am a huge fan of all things viking and history this movie is wildly disappointing the plot if you can call it that is terrible the plot twist was so see through and the ending disappoints on many levels so many great actors that went wildly underutilized couldve been great shouldve been great wasnt great
May 13 2022,negative,ugh i cant get back the time i wasted watching this poorly acted movie  i never have walked out of a movie before and would have on this one  i felt so strongly about how bad this movie was im writing this review to warn others first time leaving a review
May 13 2022,positive,northman is a movie that takes place during the 8 century about a man that wants revenge for his fathers death and is the story that hamlet was based on it has fine cinematography and quite a gory battle as the characters literally spend the bulk of the movie running and fighting in nice vistas they however lack the appeal or novelty to set up a grand tale its meant to be making the tour into foreign land a loud yet bland one
May 13 2022,negative,this was the most horrific violent pointless movie i have ever seen  85 of this movie was bloody violence  there were 3 beheadings throats slit intestines coming out blood spewing everywhere a horse beheaded in a ritual scene and they smeared his blood all over themselves  i was prepared for bloody violence as in the description but not to this extent  and so much of the movie didnt even make any sense  the whole theater was quiet when it was over  how is this entertainment  it was way over the top with the violence   i wanted to go home and throw up
May 13 2022,negative,cringe as hell it got no soul the cuts and angles were wannabe cool but sucked garbage
May 13 2022,negative,i enjoy viking movies and am not squeamish but the detailed gore wasnt necessary for the story  the screaming was distracting
May 13 2022,negative,braveheart meets the 300 this is appallingly bad at times i was anticipating a monty python punchline sadly that didnt occur i dont know why skarsgard is in this its equally as bad as his performance as flag in the stand  he appears to be chasing work for no good reason other than a pay cheque 
May 13 2022,negative,just screaming and shouting with loud music
May 13 2022,negative,um this is the worst viking movie ever made actually it may be the worst movie ever made period what were they thinking the movie tries to be unique and artsy a sort of scandinavian apocalypse now but it is much more like a satiric spoof monty python goes to valhalla do not waste even a minute of your time
May 13 2022,positive,u get what u expect nothing more and nothing less nothing interesting
May 13 2022,negative,ridiculous behavior dialogue and strange directing did the guy who wrote the screenplay drop acid before putting tv pen to paper as with the other eggers films just dumb and way overrated
May 13 2022,positive,as a history fan i was really happy to see a really accurate viking movie  yes the story is a little bit cliche but completely realistic for that era  the costumes were on top    if you like viking historyculture is a must
May 13 2022,negative,for some reason i kept watching thinking it would be something interesting in the story that was a mistake its rubbish utter nonsense do not waste your time
May 13 2022,negative,you will get better writing an directing from about any cw show this movie doesnt come close to the quality of shows like vikings or game of thrones 
May 13 2022,positive,this is a great story it takes a good hour to develop leading to a more exciting second half i would recommend it
May 13 2022,positive,more than the ultra violence that they sold me through posters and reviews its more of viking folklore than anything sadly i came more prepared for a marathon the former so the problem wasnt the film but the marketing department
May 13 2022,negative,not worth rating  worst movie i ever watched  walked out halfway into the movie
May 13 2022,negative,alexander a nearly 50yearold guy plays a young prince seeking revenge i watched the trailers i couldnt wait and it was a big disappointment everything that was shown in the trailers is actually all the action in the movie except that nothing is happening  it was hard to watch
May 13 2022,positive,one of the best movies that i see in my life awesome
May 13 2022,positive,robert eggerss unique blend of drama and gore makes this movie a mustsee
May 13 2022,negative,probably bucking the crowd but wasnt impressed  i know visuals are pretty edgy but the dialogue is formulaic and the action isnt believable a lot of overacting  many of the bad guys are worse fighters than stormtroopersone big slow swing of a sword and then stand there while they get chopped up the early scene of them around the bon fire felt like a viking tiktok dance
May 13 2022,positive,an epic reality with drama action and fantasy
May 13 2022,positive,soild movie overall
May 13 2022,positive,an absolute epic masterpiece of cinematic history and a classic historical film experience
May 13 2022,negative,absolute rubbish im a fan and very knowledgable of that period of history i started nodding off very early in the movie i has nothing just these cartoon characters screaming at the top of their voices over and over and overthe acting is terrible no character development script is nonsense there are a couple of good actors in it who just turned up for a good pay day i suspect seriously whats with the darkness in all these viking moviestv shows must be cos they are set in the dark ages or is it cheating on real scenery mmm another gripe is why is norway never used as a location must be the cost maybe no tax breaks also computer generated scenes are obviously just that so any sense of being in that time period is lost i really hope someone makes at least one decent movie of this period before its trendiness wains
May 12 2022,positive,even without seeing any trailer or poster my expectations for the northman were extremely high especially considering the people involved behind the cameras sjón is the cowriter alongside valdimar jóhannsson who was also the director of my favourite movie of 2021 lamb and robert eggers is already an established director with the witch his masterpiece for me and the lighthouse being both deservedly acclaimed entering the session i made a huge effort to put those expectations aside but i made a bet with my mother she thought the session would be empty while i thought itd be full and i got happier and happier with each new person that arrived in other words it was impossible okay the movie started and i immediately loved that medieval world the soundtrack rich in percussion is hypnotizing the cinematography again made by the excellent jarin blaschke this guy will be nominated for the oscars again is dazzling and the cast with a lot of strong names is brilliant alexander skarsgard amleth makes the most alpha male character of 2022 a true viking consumed by hate and almost not merciful anya taylorjoy olga is visually perfect for her role has her own motivations and her romance with skarsgard is as medieval as the universe i loved it claes bang fjölnir is an excellent villain i not only roared with skarsgard but also with him because both character developments converge to an epic final battle hes a worthy opponent for the protagonist about the remaining main characters willem dafoe heimer is incredible as always ethan hawke king aurvandil is a medieval mufasa björk seeress has a presence despite appearing in only two scenes and nicole kidman queen gudrún is someone who i cant talk deeply without spoilers like lamb the time seems to pass slowly and again its great in that film to get emotionally involved with the characters and here to make the audience feel both senses of journey and urgency because a viking never knows if hes going to sleep the next night there was a moment when i was afraid of the direction the film has taken but surprisingly the return from this new direction to the original one made the film even better than it could i think its hard for me to admit it because my expectations were too high but as i write this i realize that i loved this movie its not eggers best film but its still splendid oh i almost forgot the action is brutally amazing and it doesnt make the same mistake as the sadness where the violence was even more graphic but lost its impact with the time
May 12 2022,negative,to animalistic just did not enjoy movie 2 couples left theater halfway through
May 12 2022,positive,great movie  beautifully shot and edited very dark but not over the top good performances all round a dark window into a bloody period of history
May 12 2022,negative,the visuals were spectacular however anything else was unimpressive to me
May 12 2022,positive,eggers can direct yo
May 12 2022,positive,one of the best theatre experiences in a long time
May 12 2022,positive,amazing epic powerful one of the best casts ever on film this film is everything
May 12 2022,negative,dialogue is pretentious fights are fake actors are shallow any episode of vikings is better than thisthing 310 for music and scenery
May 12 2022,positive,realistic vikings movie
May 12 2022,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed it but a few silly and overwrought moments took me out of the immersion if it is trying to be an art piece akin to valhalla rising it falls short but if you loved the tone of that movie and of the vikings tv series including the mystical elements youll probably enjoy this one too it doesnt beat either of those but it falls in the same wheelhouse
May 12 2022,negative,one of the worst movies i have ever seen the cinematography is weird and the story is even weirder went with a friend and at about an hour in i just couldnt take it anymore then the couple next to me got up and left and i signaled to my friend lets do the same and we got the heck out of there the best part of the movie was knowing i did not have to watch the second half in 30 years of going to the movies this is only the second movie i have ever walked out on
May 12 2022,positive,the northman  810 robert eggers directs his most expansive and biggest film in his career the northman starring alexander skarsgard anya taylor joy nicole kidman ethan hawke bjork and willem dafoe the northman is a ruthlessly violent and raw viking revenge tale a young boy who is about to be trained to become the next king of the land must run away as his uncle murders his father kidnaps his mother and takes the reigns of the kingdom years later the boy is now a fearless and beast like warrior he vows to fulfill his personal promise of avenging his father saving his mother and killing his uncle full of eggers trademark visuals and visceral storytelling the northman is a pro typical revenge story set in norse times this is eggers most ambitious movie budget wise and scope wise he brings you into the world that he sets you to see and it is not a pleasant sight for the most part it helps give credence to the story telling but its also the downfall to the films overall goal it seems that eggers was too self indulgent with the way the film was made where there are scenes that just seem too much to hit to the point he is aiming to make it is an interesting movie but one that is super familiar and surprisingly safe in comparison to his earlier work like the witch and the lighthouse all in all the northman is still a decent film and one that leaves a mark on the viewer albeit one that might bother some people with the raw and bloody proceedings
May 12 2022,positive,a refreshing and gritty alternative to the dreary summer blockbuster lineup captivating story makes the northman well worth the watch
May 12 2022,positive,this is how you make a movie fantastic storytelling and visuals one of the best modern movies ive ever watched
May 12 2022,neutral,after three robert eggers films i can now articulate why i have a great appreciation for his directorial choices while simultaneously finding his films emotionally unengaging his efforts go into making historically culturally and symbolically rich films with massive emphasis on visual aesthetics and masterfully artful cinematography without meaning to diminish these efforts i lean on the side on categorising his work as decorative cinema that explores primal subject matters in a hyperintellectualised fashion observing reenacted moments in history feels like im watching an extravagant documentary rather than an engaging plot his use of archetypalheavy characters poetically theatrical language and unconventional exploration of genre combined with the extensive research to add an air of authenticity places a wedge between the audience to connect with emotionally engaging characters the work itself is engaging for those who wish to appreciate the art of cinema and linguistic academia but his ability to command an audiences emotional landscape is rarely present his characters are drenched in a cultural and emotional reality that are too far removed from ours to even understand how as an audience member we are supposed to adjust our viewing perspective to try and make a human connection if the unique language of the characters wasnt so culturally accurate i assume it is i may stand a chance of understanding what theyre actually saying however this poetry puts me in mind of how i feel about shakespeare brilliant for those who have a command of the language but leaves the rest of us without a clue what is being said and have to interpret the story through the mood and action  so i often feel like im at a loss with his narrative style i appreciate them as films but as stories they dont leave me feeling nourished or changed having said that im still glad that they exist for the demographic who are able to make the connections that i wish i could
May 12 2022,positive,visually stunning good stroyline interesting characters and good medieval combats are all in this movie
May 12 2022,negative,it stunk the worse movie i have ever watched
May 12 2022,positive,this movie is a truly interesting delve into the historically factual belief system of the 8th and 9th century vikings  unbelievable accuracy depicting a version of shakespears hamlet style story telling     historical accuracy at every level especially finally depicting the raids on the rus as being routine because they were
May 12 2022,negative,this is an embarrassment of the nordicviking history  nicole kidman needs to quit with the mother roles  dont waste your time watching this
May 12 2022,neutral,stunning visuals and decent acting performances dont stop the northman from being a very cliché and at times dull viking story there was little emotional attachment to any of the characters and the conclusion was less than satisfying
May 12 2022,negative,this was more a scifinot a real viking film acting was fake and ridiculous totally disappointed in everything
May 12 2022,positive,great action and graphics
May 12 2022,positive,badass movie loved it left me speechless
May 12 2022,positive,that shit crazy people dying everywhere  great fight scenes for sure bring the family along would watch again
May 12 2022,positive,beautifully made kept me watching the whole time the battles were awesome to see
May 12 2022,negative,cool cinematography wasnt planning on watching a whole hour of blood rituals around a camp fire
May 12 2022,negative,i cant remember the last time i saw a movie this bad with all the hype i was certainly let down honestly just watch the last kingdom if you want to watch a good showing of a son seeking revenge for the killing of his father also the movie is so dark on the screen you miss things wait till it comes to netflix and turn your screen brightness up save your money
May 12 2022,positive,awesome movie great story very visceral and raw the way a movie should be madeloved the soundtrack with all the norse mythology
May 12 2022,positive,the northman is visually stunning brutal and complex if youre going in expecting a straightforward revenge action movie you will be disappointed this is robert eggers take on a revenge story so it has a flair for the experimental every shot utilizes a breath taking landscape behind it and the camera movement is spectacular the action scenes utilize many one takes that enhance the action significantly the gore and brutality are unflinching and there is much of it this is a surprisingly complex film that is in no ways black and white or good vs evil each character has evil inside of them and does brutal things the acting is also great every actor utilizes the brutality and weirdness of the story to great effect if i have one complaint its that the passing occasionally drags but the film quickly picks back up and has a great climax the northman is a gorgeous brutal exhilarating and complex film that you wont want to mess if you enjoy films a bit more on the experimental side score  a
May 12 2022,negative,i would have rather watched paint dry
May 12 2022,negative,worst movie ive ever seen could and should have been amazing but the writing direction and acting was just tragic dont waste your time
May 12 2022,positive,if you enjoyed films like the revenant or apocalypto you will love this movie dont go in expecting large scale battles and nonstop action instead strap in for a gritty revenge epic and get the most out of it
May 12 2022,positive,predictable but in a good way this is some old school story telling done well
May 12 2022,negative,it was either a phony story about viking cultural history whether danish norwegian or swedish or frisian that may have started attacking settlements in what is now russia for slaves or just very poorly told i cannot justify very well why i did not get up and walk out after the first 30 minutes it never got better
May 12 2022,positive,not a perfect film but a great one
May 11 2022,negative,tried way too hard to be an artistic vision when it a bloody tale of revenge that was way overproduced with way too many fantasy special effects i laughed out loud multiple times at the ludicrous overacting and lame social effects luckily i bought my ticket for a discounted screening time so limited my lossmaybe not of time but money
May 11 2022,positive,another masterpiece from robert eggers
May 11 2022,positive,if you have seen recent modern movies you will walk away from this film and say wow that was an actual real movie it is genuinely refreshing its like a movie from the real world i am 100 satisfied with it
May 11 2022,negative,weird movie i was expecting a cooking movie what a waste of time
May 11 2022,positive,awesome film in all ways
May 11 2022,positive,wonderful acting story directing casting  alexander skarsgard was incredible in this as were all the other actors  big surprise in store for future viewers as regards nicole kidman
May 11 2022,positive,people who know hamlet was based on the story of amleth will enjoy this movie good overall story decent action and the ending is perfect
May 11 2022,negative,worst movie i have seen in the last 20 years save your money
May 11 2022,positive,if you go in expecting an action movie you will be disappointed this is a viking revenge story bathed with heavy doses of mythos not a big budget sword and sandals epic but anyone familiarized with norse lore or even a general interest in vikings should be thrilled by it i was a huge fan of vvitch and couldnt be happier with this one as well handled both the brutal realism and the fantastical elements perfectly
May 11 2022,negative,hard to hear dialoge too unbelievable for all the stars in it i thought it would be better
May 11 2022,positive,a masterpiece  amazing visuals  love the writerdirectors style and vision  dark raw and gritty   please keep making more movies like this and thewitch
May 11 2022,positive,visually stunning with a great cast may be a bit graphic for some folks
May 11 2022,negative,wellacted but film was too dark
May 11 2022,positive,an amazing experience stunning visuals and great plot and the soundtrack was just perfect will definitely rewatch
May 11 2022,positive,if you like violent mythical viking revenge stories with sometimes dark but always beautiful scenes then this is the film for you i thoroughly enjoyed it
May 11 2022,neutral,what a let down given i havent liked any of robert eggers movies but maybe with an actual budget he could pull off a great epic for the ages unfortunately that didnt happen instead we got a revenge story with cool background  scenery and great cameras but with terrible unlikeable characters alexander skarsgard plays his normal type casted role of being a big buff guy who can scream and look cool fighting but his actual acting skills are still average theyre not bad by any means but he did better in true blood its not his fault the main issue this movie has is the script you could do a lot in the old medieval world but instead we got a realistic odyssey without the cool monsters this movie is a true heroes journey but the culmination of it all at the end falls flat unfortunately of course the main character prevails but by dying in every great epic the main character needs to die for some reason it didnt feel earned and felt awkward at the ending it felt rushed and the whole ending fight scene couldve been 15 minutes of yelling and fighting but nope we got 5 measily minutes of fighting with both dying also nicole kidman s characters choice of that one scene was pure disgusting if you watched the movie youll know what im talking about in the end the northman is a huge let down maybe if this movie had more of a heroes journey like hercules or odysseus battling monsters just to get to his final destination it wouldve felt more satisfying but instead once hes there he plays the boring waiting game i know its strategy but at the end he died anyway so he couldve had a cool war once he got there anyway sucks this movie had to be this way and it officially cements robert eggers as another director who had potential but is all hype unfortunately
May 11 2022,negative,the trailer will get your hopes up for an action viking movie but every scene you see in the trailer is every action scene in the movie this movie is more than a drama than an action movie if i didnt see the trailer id say this movie is okay for a shaksperian play maybe its more fir history buffs i think
May 11 2022,negative,not much of a story unless you count guys growling at each other
May 11 2022,positive,loved the battle scenes and the decision he had to make and ended up defeating his nemesis yet still getting his woman in the end with her power to get him home to be with his wife and babies excellent scenes love won in the end
May 11 2022,positive,not my kind of movie but i can appreciate it
May 11 2022,positive,this is how you make a movie
May 11 2022,negative,terrible that says it all
May 11 2022,positive,love a good old vengeful viking moviehad a weird moment but all and all it delivered
May 11 2022,negative,it was a broadway version of a viking story where in every scene they told the actors to go full blown nick cage and over actdramatize everything not worth anyones time 
May 11 2022,negative,how this movie got 89 is beyond me lol
May 11 2022,positive,an interesting often gory and different movie has eggers direction all over it as you will be able to tell overall an enjoyable revenge tale individually stunning at times it might not appeal to mainstream audiences like most of eggers films
May 11 2022,positive,a little slow paced  thought there would be more action
May 11 2022,negative,with a cast of incredibly talented actors this has to be the worst movie ive even seen is this what entertainments about today wish i walked out early  asked for my money back
May 11 2022,positive,it was a good movie a little weird at times in my opinion with the mystical stuff but i get its not supposed to be realistic i liked the plot and they executed it pretty well a lot of cool fighting and plenty of blood and gore
May 11 2022,positive,i loved the movie very good action scenes set costumes and make up were very good
May 11 2022,negative,long nonsensical the only reason i could say this movie kept me on the edge of my seat is because i was consistently on the verge of walking out in the middle of it 
May 10 2022,positive,a myth of yore put to film i think alot of people misunderstand the goal of this film it is to make a saga written in an old way with modern recording methods beautiful if you dont go into it expecting a tom cruise blockbuster film a mythological master piece that demands thought and a modicum of knowledge of how ancient myths were structured and of how melancholic norse myths were especially
May 10 2022,negative,the action was good the story was okay as long as you could follow the dialogue was a little hard to understand
May 10 2022,positive,enjoy it more than i expected
May 10 2022,positive,the only thing one could hold against the movie is that sometimes it takes too long a refreshing movie that is actually worth your time
May 10 2022,positive,the northman is a brutal film and very tough to swallow directed by robert eggers of the witch and the lighthouse like the witch this movie immerses you in a dark journey of insanity as we see a viking prince named amleth played by alexander sasgard who wants revenge on his uncle for killing his father when he was a young boy he waits years to exact his revenge and it is here where the movie descends into pure insanity it is a revenge tale through and through with no mercy this makes it hard to support our hero yet is intriguing and beautifully directed with sceneries and locales that are beautiful shot in northern ireland the violence is graphic and disturbing consistent with the brutality of the viking people in the end is a revenge tale making us wonder about how low man is willing to go in sacrificing his humanity to get what you want
May 10 2022,negative,dear god this was terrible an absolute waste of twenty quid and 2 and a half hours 30 minutes in i desperately needed a wee rather than go to the toilet i held it in for the next 2 hours just to have something to focus on that wasnt the drivel in front of me   all the pace of a documentary a soundtrack as if from your teenage next door neighbour thats learning the drums and scenes from your local drama group where the teacher instructs a bunch of amateurs to become a dog and now dance
May 10 2022,negative,its a very mixed back between artsy madhouse and violent action film  its not for everyone and it does have some good points but those good points are mostly outweighed by all the times the move just goes too far
May 10 2022,neutral,the lion king meets the passion of the christ nothing much to say a couple of nice scenes but overall a dumb flick
May 10 2022,negative,beautifully shot and the acting is not to blame just boring as all hell a story told a million times way too long and totally superfluous waste of money and your time skip it unless youre obsessed with viking myths
May 10 2022,negative,garbage squared even when you could understand what they were saying it still didnt make sense filmed on a grassy hill with filthy living conditions it was a movie that should have been left on the cutting room floor in its entirety
May 10 2022,positive,wow i didnt expect to love this film the ultrarealism is balanced by the norse mythology which comes across as a subconscious altered state the fantasy elements totally work with this iron age existence i loved the simple revenge story as well as the changes in the lead characters perception as he learns more and more about the events that created his vengeance quest there was even a moment when the terror of facing a viking hit me in full visually spectacular the cinematography toggles between the harsh elemental world and highly accurate depictions of viking culture also the soundtrack was fantastic kind of a darker take on scandinavian musical tropes  lastly the long running time had zero negative impact on me once i was in this brutal world i was in great film unexpectedly intense viewing experience
May 10 2022,negative,baby killing mother kissing suck of a movie
May 10 2022,positive,storyline and backdrops
May 10 2022,positive,epic movie super intense and beautiful in so many different ways everybody should give this a shot and especially in theaters it takes you to a whole different place
May 10 2022,positive,the movie took me for a surprise going in the movie without seeing the trailer i was tolentino on a rollercoaster for a surprise of a dark gritty worley version of the vikings story i didnt expect it to be so dark but i ended up really loving the film as the cinematography was astounding it surprised me and had me on the edge of my seat the whole time although i do wish that in the beginning it could have led more of a surprise in the end as the end was practically told how it would unfold from the beginning i do wish that the end had more of a ending versus cutting right after the death of the main character amleth overall id rate this a good 8510 will be seeing again twice in theaters tomorrow
May 10 2022,positive,will make you want to rip out your foes jugular with your teeth with a great viking roar raaaaah
May 10 2022,negative,story was great movie felt too dark and drawn out without much action
May 10 2022,positive,according to my daughter who has a degree in medieval studies and teaches history this movie is straight norse myth  after she explained it and norse mythology the movie made alot more sense to me  however without that understanding it is very confusing but apparently it is a very typical scandinavian movie format and story so that is really all i can offer
May 10 2022,positive,a very pagan hamlet  great fun
May 10 2022,negative,i really wanted to like this movie but the horrible script made it impossible i cannot speak to the acting since the actors were not given anything to work with the editing was nonexistent i think high schoolers could have put together something better could someone have opened a history book for a brief moment it would have been nice had they watched even one episode of the vikings from the history channel this is my first and only one star review
May 10 2022,positive,the northman is an ambitious risk given the state of modern day hollywood that means a lot however that does not shield the movie from criticism yes the northman delivers a violent and visually fantastical experience however in the area of pacing the film has serious issues the story is exceedingly simple and one which you have most likely seen before which means the movies efforts to pause the action and marinate on the nature of revenge are not welcome it bogs down the movie and at sometimes can just be plain old boring  the movie needed to cut some fat and stick to a simple violent revenge film with some fantastical elements with all that being said the movie definitely swings for the fences and that might be enough to take this film to valhalla
May 10 2022,positive,excellent work of cinematography with exceptional set pieces and locations a truly visceral viking experience it can feel slowpaced at times which feels completely intentional because when it does hit it hits hard similar in essence to films like bladerunner 2049 albeit in a much different setting highly recommend
May 10 2022,positive,we need many more movies that value historical accuracy and emersion over flashy nonsense no woke forced messaging either very refreshing
May 10 2022,positive,this was an amazing experience i cannot think of a movie that combines the shakespearean drama viking folklore and visceral action all together so seamlessly it was conan meets vikings meets hamlet
May 10 2022,positive,it was well directed with a lot of scenes that looked like a one camera pan but the story gets heady and you dont know if some of this is in his mind or what
May 10 2022,positive,its very artsy and dark and really brutal in spots you need to know about norse mythology to get some of the references  and know something about viking culture to really get the most out of it the end makes perfect sense when viewed with those things in mind the pacing was the worst part but overall a solid movie i wouldnt go see it in the theater again but it was worth the watch
May 10 2022,positive,the movie is captivating in all aspects the cinematography the visuals and the performances it is gritty and raw eggers did well by not polluting the plot and characters with our modern day ideas and morality  some scenes are pure perfection and unforgettable the berserker ritual the i am amleth scene
May 10 2022,negative,horrible two hours too long 
May 10 2022,positive,loved seeing the norse beliefs and history shown
May 10 2022,negative,horrible would give zero starts if it was an option   nothing happened and they died naked in a volcano  wtf
May 9 2022,positive,hmm i shouldve expected what i watched since its an a24 film dont get me wrong i enjoyed myself but i think the trailer misled me i pictured this big epic like avengers or something and thats not at all what this movie is and i think its better this way     the movie explores vikings and norse mythology and i dont know much about that stuff but i think the movie stayed true to itself which i respect its a brutal tale and the brutality doesnt let up for a second    the weird part for me was that it seemed like the actors were acting in a play rather than a movie which was kind of interesting it added like dramatic flair to the experience which i have to say this is more of an experience than a movie you leave the theater with a sense of how rough life was back then and how far weve come in some areas stay the same in others and fallen in a few more     i too would like to note games like last of us 2 and anime like aot try to engage the audience to blur the line between good in evil because where exactly is the truth when the two victims are also the reason for the pain this movie has a gritty real approach to the same concepts what exactly is human nature the love for our families what is expected of us from others and also ourselves what are we willing to sacrifice to protect what we believe in    regardless tldr in my experience the movie wont be what you expect but i definitely think its worth watching and experiencing a new perspective on story telling norse mythology and humanity as a whole in the distant long forgotten past understanding its still hollywood so is this even true who knows just enjoy the movie and stop having existential crises
May 9 2022,negative,clearly a movie that i would not have signed up to see if i knew it was as bad as it was
May 9 2022,positive,i thought it was decent despite what many people are saying its a long slow dark artistic movie i will say i thought despite all that it went by quickly and kept me interested throughout
May 9 2022,positive,this movie is absolutely incredible its a must see so far this spring it has everything you want in a viking movie and the movie has beautiful acting nichole kindman was incredible
May 9 2022,negative,i liked the movie trailer not a good movie disappointed  bad acting fight scenes looked fake  there are so many musical groups who perform viking type songs that could have made the music score so much better
May 9 2022,negative,we liked the credits at the end and that was about it
May 9 2022,negative,i love viking type movies but was highly disappointed with this one  the story was disjointed and the main hero wasnt quite there
May 9 2022,positive,the reason you see so many one star reviews is because the christians were offended dont go see this movie if you are looking for game of thrones this is a movie about norse mythology
May 9 2022,negative,watched the movie by accident  lost about two hours of my life  this movie is so bad i wanted to warn others against paying to watch this atrocity
May 9 2022,positive,i will avenge you father i will save you mother i will kill you fjölnir    robert eggers is a filmmaker that is slowly becoming another one of my new favorites the man is a master craftsman when it comes to filmmaking his debut feature was the 2015 movie the witch and the first movie i saw of him was the 2019 psychohorror film the lighthouse which starred  willem dafoe and robert pattinson it was a weird bizarre horrifying and an amazing movie going experience unfortunately my theater was kind of empty when i saw it back on halloween 2019 understandably so it was halloween night when i saw it and everyone was out partying while i watched willem dafoe and robert pattinson go absolutely bonkers in front of a 1191 camera    a couple of years later i saw a trailer for this movie the northman  in theaters and i immediately got excited to see robert eggers directing this supposed viking epic  that is supposed to be the catalyst to inspire shakespears hamlet you know the whole king gets brutally murdered by his hateful brother and the prince vows vengeance on his evil uncle thankfully the northman is more than an epic take on viking culture much like everything everywhere all at once this is the kind of movie one must experience in a movie theater at least more than once the performances are too good to be true the cinematography gives the sense of urgency and vengeance which is a core theme of the film please go check it out as soon as you can it is the kind of film that is too good to be true and is one of the many stand outs to have come out in 2022
May 9 2022,positive,its an epic   if youre a fan of revenge movies you will love it
May 9 2022,negative,terrible movie extremely slow and morbid
May 9 2022,negative,i saw it on saturday and i left with about 30 minutes to go  maybe it was just the fact that the graphics were horrible and the sound was compressed and just loud or maybe it was just because the movie just rambled on with screams and gore with no point
May 9 2022,positive,the northman feels like what you would get if ingmar bergman and sam peckinpah had a love childand then neglected it  a visually captivating yet utterly mirthless love letter to toxic masculinity that leaves alexander skarsgård to grunt and grimace his way through a landscape of plotholes while the rest of the capable cast are left with little to do
May 9 2022,positive,a wild visuallythrilling retelling of a classic norse legend brought to life by terrific performances and assured direction by robert eggers grade a
May 9 2022,negative,i can not figure out what critics found so great about this movie  one of the worst i have seen in a long time
May 9 2022,positive,i wished they had gone into more of the folklore of their beliefs and it could have been shorter
May 9 2022,positive,i came for what i receivedso i was happy with it it was good 
May 9 2022,positive,i thought the ending should have been better not both of them dieing
May 9 2022,negative,really bad movie i was expecting something a bit better because of the cast but i was disappointed some special effects were terribly bad for example the part where the guy drags nicole kidmans body was a joke you could see that was a doll the plot was also very bad there were loads of people leaving the theater
May 9 2022,positive,this movie was artistic brutal and told a fascinating story
May 9 2022,negative,if you love violence and hate women this is the movie for you warning to moms through out the land this is no rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead
May 9 2022,positive,the story just didnt go anywhere enjoyed the acting and scenery but wouldnt watch it again
May 9 2022,negative,from previously watching the trailer for northmen this movie was not what we expected we felt we were greatly mislead by the trailer
May 9 2022,negative,little story mostly gore and grunts too long  made myself fall asleep to escape watching since i was with friends
May 9 2022,positive,a story already seen and reviewed but fantastically staged with superb photography and fantastic shots give it a chance
May 9 2022,negative,sub par acting  too long  plot was  childish  too much unnecessary  yelling and silly acts  this film was absolutely adolescent and unnecessary violence
May 9 2022,positive,it was a little too long
May 9 2022,positive,great movie from start to finish with very well written scripts
May 9 2022,negative,twisted and incoherent plot which did not focus clearly on the growth of the protagonist the action in this movie solely focused on violence the movie was predictable long and did not focus as well on the cinematography as it should have there were evil elements throughout the movie which was coupled with christianity which was not appropriate for this setting
May 9 2022,negative,don waste your money with this movie  too weird and gruesome you have to high on drugs to watch this movie
May 9 2022,positive,this shit is crazy woah maybe im just speaking out of my ass because i did see this a little  if you know what i mean but solid 910
May 9 2022,negative,from previously watching the trailer for northmen this movie was not what we expected  we felt we were greatly mislead by the trailer
May 9 2022,positive,incredible movie sad to see the reviewers who bash the movie are the ones who think the latter seasons of vikings were good
May 9 2022,positive,remember this movie is related to eager allen poes stories
May 9 2022,positive,amazing movie incredible action awesome story
May 9 2022,positive,this film does a lot of things right and i definitely enjoyed it but it could really use another editing pass it seems as though a deliberate effort was made to stretch certain shots across pieces of music sacrificed was the pacing of the film
May 9 2022,positive,a viking spin on hamlet  although more inspired by the folktales that influenced the shakespeare classic   that with its outstanding ensemble cast stunning cinematography epic scope striking imagery bloody and crude action sequences stylish visuals impressive production haunting score accurate portrayal of nordic culture and expert filmmaking at its core this is robert eggers most ambitious work  and possibly his masterpiece one of the best films of 2022 so far
May 9 2022,positive,the best movie to come out of hollywood in a very long time
May 9 2022,positive,this is a beautifully rendered thoughtprovoking extremely stylish and 100 unique type of epic movie which is probably why it hasnt succeeded in the box office because it is so well done demands your attention is relatively long and is quite the opposite of flashy for the most part
May 9 2022,negative,it took every ounce of will to not abandon this movie earlier than i did
May 9 2022,negative,was so disappointed in this movie  so different than other viking movies ive loved just strange
May 9 2022,neutral,we both felt it was drug out too long some weird parts for instance why do his love have braces in his near death dream not great overall and disappointed i spent money to see it in a  theatre
May 9 2022,negative,worst 2 12 hours of my life if i could give it 0 stars i would
May 9 2022,negative,if you thought this movie was going to be something like gladiator or braveheart you will be sadly mistaken it is nothing like those movies somehow they turn it into some mystical dark ancient spiritual movie of the time period 
May 9 2022,positive,no character build up long beautifully shot movie
May 9 2022,positive,finally a movie that doesnt try to preach to you just a well done film that tells a story while nailing historical details of the vikings pulls you in from start to finish highly recommended 
May 9 2022,negative,the audience reviewers are more on the mark  i love the viking shows over the last few years but this movie had a weak plot and was boring  too many weird moments for me
May 8 2022,neutral,i was hoping for the 13th warrior but got more green knight instead it was alright but should have been much better ive learned that when critics give a movie high marks when the audience gives it much lower trust the audience
May 8 2022,negative,stupid story very dark and boring
May 8 2022,negative,the scenery was pretty
May 8 2022,negative,the movie was awful from start to finish
May 8 2022,positive,it was too long for me to sit through
May 8 2022,positive,loved the story and the photography  beautiful scenery
May 8 2022,negative,not very good very violent movie for mothers day
May 8 2022,positive,beautiful costumes scenery and cinematography overall it was rather disappointing perhaps it would have been better if i was a scholar of viking history and culture
May 8 2022,positive,great movie  it could be misleading at time but overall loved the movie
May 8 2022,positive,i will watch it again when it is out for rent then i qill probably buy it it was good but i am also a fan of this type of movie
May 8 2022,negative,if no stars was an option what the actual f was that by far the worst movie we have ever seen vomit meets diarrhea  
May 8 2022,positive,too heavy on the dream sequences story felt too stop and go at times
May 8 2022,positive,straightforward definitely does not describe this movie if anything its pretty weird but i cant act like it doesnt have some good things about it however all the negatives really just make this an ok movie for me
May 8 2022,positive,it is badass im sure theres some flaws or critic to it i did reminisce of conan but this is the northman
May 8 2022,positive,plot was weak effects were cool not enough to make up for the lack of a glorious kingdom worth fighting for or riveting fight scenes nicole kidmans character was one dimensional and her performance was over the top
May 8 2022,negative,a movie that tells a pointless generic revenge story with no accuracy because there is nothing historic watchable but dull
May 8 2022,positive,a gritty revenge tale that goes hardcore  loved the visuals and the cast  definitely worth checking out
May 8 2022,positive,great movie well worth the watch especially for any fans of anything norse
May 8 2022,negative,though the religious ritual scenes rip us out of our thin secularity most of the movie is a ponderous onenote bloodbath an unmoving unsurprising even unrealistic wallowing in revenge this makes the 13th warrior look sublime
May 8 2022,positive,great movie it kept me engaged the entire time no real slow points enjoyable movie
May 8 2022,positive,heros journey from norse mythology starts off a bit weird but gets really good
May 8 2022,negative,long bloody and boring not worth the time and money
May 8 2022,negative,worst crap ive seen for a long time over dramatized with a weak story youkilledmylovedonesandnowispendthewholemovietoplottherevenge type with some illuminati rituals to spice it up last movie on a longhaul maybe but nothing more    the usually trustworthy imdb rating failed miserably on this one    film buff
May 8 2022,positive,not what i expected i thought there should have been more fighting in this movie   it was more like a revenge from just one person then having an army fight to then find out that at the end he dies anyway
May 8 2022,positive,awesome movie its a must see for sure
May 8 2022,positive,if you want to see mythology intertwined with the closest youll see to historically accurate viking culture this is the movie for you
May 8 2022,positive,i love the story line and the action and fight scenes very beautiful backgrounds
May 8 2022,negative,ridiculous plot and storyline the characters were constantly taking completely stupid actions against their stated objectives fights scenes were often wwe wrestling style with an obvious victor only to lose due to the extremely dramatic pause while the defeated fighter screamed his or her way to victory unbelievably bad
May 8 2022,positive,brutal slow burn revenge tale
May 8 2022,positive,very very predictableno highs or lows just kinda falls flat
May 8 2022,positive,loved the action and the storyl
May 8 2022,positive,way too much weird viking myths while the movie has some of the coolest scenes ive ever seen in a movie i hope i dont have to endure the entire film again anytime soon 
May 8 2022,positive,watching this film in cinemas was a timely postpandemic treat sealing my respect towards eggers and his creative style and direction beyond the horror genre following the story of a sons revenge to the murder of his father and some unexpected revelations on the way the movie excels not only in its storytelling but also in the performances of such an amazing cast as well as its outstanding cinematography especially the darkernight scenes which are quite plenty as for the gore though definitely not a movie for the fainthearted
May 8 2022,neutral,looks great and is quite fun to watch  but has no historical accuracy at all freya is not a male god i dont think that berseker danced around a fire to get into their frenzy also norse people did rarely sacrifice humans and in this movie they sacrifice them left and right  if put into a fantasy setting its a fun movie about revenge but with the historical background its pretty bad
May 8 2022,positive,love this beautifully shot and very historically accurate great action
May 8 2022,positive,gorgeous cinematography that really pulls you into the historical period being depicted the actors performances really sell what would otherwise be a fairly generic revenge plot
May 8 2022,positive,good acting but i definitely found myself stifling laughs at times im pretty sure werent meant to be funny enjoyed the play of myths and how story was at times playing in fantasy  fun ill probably watch again when available on streaming
May 8 2022,positive,just awesome  i loved it this movie just rocked  they had the valkerie with tattooed teeth yes i know there is no evidence women did this but it was still awesome  kidman would have not been my pick she did look out of place  i guess too much botox made her look rigid  other than that the movie was great  i really loved it  it has a great story and makes you rethink your youth
May 8 2022,negative,this is my first movie review came here to say this is the worst movie ive ever watched save your money and time 
May 8 2022,negative,im absolutely speechless probably the worst movie ive ever seen
May 8 2022,positive,very well done and i love the shakespeare nods
May 8 2022,positive,a movie that had me enthralled with how immersive it was plus its use of subtle elements that kept moving the movie forward in addition it had wonderful use of scenery and music lead to a really rich experience that i look forward to enjoying many times in the future
May 8 2022,positive,exactly what you would think it would be stunning landscapes dark music well historically researched and gripping although it was eggers first big budget film it seemed to have a less psychological horror to it definitely some creepy scenes and had a ton of weird rituals it was good and had a good story worth the watch if youre a fan of eggersari film styles overall fun to watch
May 8 2022,positive,not what i expected i love the genre but wasnt prepared for the bizarre pagan rituals and fantasy based plot
May 8 2022,positive,love it great soundtrack and overall mood of the story
May 8 2022,positive,too long bogged down in places sad was really looking forward to seeing it
May 8 2022,positive,cinematography was good story was great acting was on point
May 8 2022,negative,dont understand what the fuss is about nothing at all like what i thought it would be
May 8 2022,positive,there were pretty interesting things about the movie but there are some directing decisions that i didnt like at all
May 8 2022,negative,im not sure who this movie is for but it was not for me not the farts or the digiridoo throat singing
May 8 2022,positive,visually a great movie  quality acting and some really good scenes however the storyline just never quite pulled me in like other great historical movies have done it just seemed to miss the mark if you like viking history and mythology you will probably like the movie it mixes in some mythology throughout the story which made the movie feel a little like fantasy at times
May 8 2022,positive,if tales of vengeance and good versus evil are your things then northman is a must see hand to hand combat at its finest i couldnt have enjoyed it more it is fire
May 8 2022,negative,the movie did not deliver on the hype  several good actors but the storyline did not flow well and the details leading up to the main story in the first 30 minutes are almost comical which im sure they were not intended to be
May 8 2022,positive,wow nicole kidmans character was a real c word i would have like to see less horses heads cut off and more undesirable humans decapitated the portrayal of my ancestors was questionable pretty sure they raped a lot more people
May 8 2022,positive,absolutely brutal the hero is a hero in the classical sense very flawed and very nearly as evil as those he fights    the visuals were incredible the costumes were like they were lifted straight out of the early middle ages and the events depicted were a heart pounding mix of brutal historical realism and all the mysticism that the people themselves might have seen in their world    definitely give it a watch just know what you are getting into
May 8 2022,negative,way to long and poorly acted
May 8 2022,positive,good movie but dont expect a traditional action adventure film
May 8 2022,positive,very bloody not a very good plot
May 8 2022,negative,walked out  they tried but it was poorly edited and somewhat ridiculous
May 7 2022,positive,69 score half the time i was shaking my head and was like the fuck
May 7 2022,negative,wow  wasnt expecting to need a drink at the end of the film  it was  as advertised  very dark and very graphic violent and downright gruesome  after over 2 hours of this my sister and i were completely exhausted  we love action adventure films but this was too too much
May 7 2022,negative,the previews and reviews played this up to be a good movie  really wished it was but it was long drawn out and lacking a plot that kept me interested  if you like this type of movie great   but i wish i stayed home and watched vikings again
May 7 2022,positive,my 1st time back to the theatres since february has brought me one hell of an experience thanks to the movie gods that movies like these are still made if you truly love film and what it is capable of doing then this is the film for you god bless director robert eggers one of the few filmmakers nowadays actually making real movies
May 7 2022,positive,it was action packed and riveting i loved it
May 7 2022,negative,the concepts behind the movie if you read about before or after watching it are interesting but this was a really dreadful theatre experience for me i didnt care about any of the characters
May 7 2022,positive,except i had to endure 25min worth of commercial  previews thanks
May 7 2022,positive,i liked how accurate it felt but the content was overwhelming otherwise like the movie had more gore than i have a taste for and sex scenes   i also didnt love the characters dont get me wrong the actors played their characters skillfully the characters themselves were all evil though it was just very disheartening for me  i felt like the films message was overall good with it showing the destructiveness of violence hate and revenge
May 7 2022,positive,the northman plunges viewers into the deep end of norse history mythology culture ritual and tradition robert eggers strengths as a filmmaker shine in his marriage of bleak historical reality with stark matter of fact fantasy and mythology whether its a witch haunting a family on the outskirts of the colonial frontier or a mermaid bewitching two lighthouse keepers trapped in isolation eggers is a master of his craft here eggers transcends his filmmaking to its next level and depicts a viking saga in all its epic glory the particular story that eggers chose to adapt is the norse epic of amleth which is laden with all the trappings of the heros journey and will be familiar to audiences who know shakespeares hamlet its very refreshing to see a talented young filmmaker who doesnt hold the audiences hand 247 and leaves some things up to ambiguity though more straightforward in narrative than his previous efforts the northman still has plenty of surreal sequences of which the viewer is left to interpret the meaning of themselves eggers has proven here that he is more than capable of directing big action sequences with talent and continues to shine with stunning visuals and cinematography in his films this is a larger than life masterpiece of an epic which i cant recommend strongly enough and is certainly the new gold standard when it comes to media depicting norse viking culture in a historically accurate and entertaining manner
May 7 2022,negative,the storyline was weird and somehow also boring we stayed hoping it would turn around but it never did i give it the lowest rating because i regret not walking out early and thats unheard of for me
May 7 2022,positive,fantastic a must see in dolby cinema
May 7 2022,negative,the actors promised something good and they didnt deliver the ladys comment next to me after it well that was bullshit and i wholeheartedly agree brutal and absurdly psychedelic and just wrong on so many levels the wonderful anya was one small beacon of light but unfortunately not enough save your money
May 7 2022,negative,poor story too long silly and boring as all get out
May 7 2022,positive,it was certainly refreshing to see a period film without diversity and social justice crap shoehorned in however at the end of the day i found it just ok as a movie  it wasnt bad but i wouldnt rush to see it again  someone who really likes violence may appreciate it more  i also found some of the scenes very odd
May 7 2022,positive,a deep look at revenge honor and the needs of family
May 7 2022,positive,great fighting scenes plot line was ok meh
May 7 2022,positive,how much is real how much is in his head i dont know but this dark saga of cruelty vengeance and fate was spectacular the image of the sky riding valkyrie is still in my mindnot to mention the lady of the birch a truly thoughtprovoking work of art naturally the simpletons who enjoy the mcu dc and contemporary hollywood drivel in general will be quite confused by this we need more like it
May 7 2022,negative,not very good previews are a bit misleadingfelt there was a lot left out of the storyback ground of it all and ending rushed  many people actually left the theater during the initial raid
May 7 2022,positive,both best viking movie and since covid movie  finally someting as historical as possible without the actual hollywood trend to include races newer appeared in that historical contest
May 7 2022,negative,terrible dragged story went in circles
May 7 2022,negative,terrible bad acting punctuated by lots of blood
May 7 2022,positive,it is something unique but i do not recommend it to people who can not see blood as this one is very graphic
May 7 2022,neutral,i thought it was going to be so good but it was confusing and stupid
May 7 2022,positive,the northman 2022 based on viking myth amleth seeks to avenge death of his father by his uncle sound familiar substitute hamlet and you know the key plot points full of savagery blood and gore authentic looking throughout but i never got invested in the characters b    the closest movie i can think of that has a similar look and feel although its an entirely different period and story is 2019s the lighthouse also directed by robert eggers these movies tend to make an impression that sticks with you
May 7 2022,positive,best movie ever my friends are beta cucks and did not like it this is an alpha movie for alphas only
May 7 2022,negative,i had high expectations but i left the theater disappointed im not sure why the ratings for this picture are so high stay home and watch vikings reruns
May 7 2022,positive,brutal european great story
May 7 2022,positive,good and bad here supposed to be the most historically accurate depiction of the age the dialog was laughable at times lots of blood 
May 7 2022,negative,an audiovisual assault of gore and extremismglad when it ended
May 7 2022,positive,worth seeing for the visuals alone
May 7 2022,positive,i really enjoyed this adaptation of the lion king aka hamlet
May 7 2022,negative,confusing poor character development disjointed i left the theater wondering why i sat through it all
May 7 2022,positive,just saw the northman it was different than i expected but in a good way   definitely not a hollywood movie this is not gladiator  but pretty epic and tragic and brutal  i really enjoyed it alexander skarsgard goes full beast mode and if anyone was born to play a viking berserker its him
May 7 2022,positive,excellent intense artistic brutal yet human lots of folklore brought to reality
May 7 2022,negative,seriously a fever dream of a movie take toxic masculinity and make it an art school portfolio project
May 7 2022,positive,i heard so much about this movie and  i was surprised by it it is a very good movie it feels like an epic  the direction and acting were first class it was great to see ethan hawke and willem dafoe  the last good movie i saw about the vikings was on dvd the movie was the viking with kirk douglas  it really takes us back to an era where life was cheap and brutal the 900s in northern europe where the vikings were the main dominant force at sea and on land in scandinavian countries  it remains me of the movie gladiator how the life of the gladiator was really brutal there is a few   scenes with norsemen vikings mythology  valhalla valkyrie thor if you dont know about viking mythology it could be difficult to understand some scenes overall  i enjoy this movie very much
May 7 2022,positive,this movie was absolutely brilliant you wont like it if you dont like shakespeare this is a movie about the viking saga that inspired shakespeare to write hamlet it was poetic and surprisingly historically accurate sure the actors were nicer looking than back than but the also spoke modern english because well this movie was made for a modern audience using modern day stars pretty easy to overlook that one flaw lol i loved it and will be adding this to my physical collection on release
May 7 2022,negative,the story line was horrible and the plot was just same old plot
May 7 2022,positive,an enthralling norse epic from start to finish
May 7 2022,negative,no idea what i just watched
May 7 2022,positive,a great movie with lots of norse mythology mixed in
May 7 2022,positive,loved the exploration of viking culture scenery and action were incredible it was on the long sidemaybe even a bit too long but its worth every second of it
May 7 2022,negative,the writer and director were definitely doing some serious drugs
May 7 2022,positive,easily in my top 5 favorite films of all time arguably my number 1   there are very few films that hit each and every note in the way this one does  the emotion is extreme combined with the cinematography casting acting mythology and so much more combine to provide an experience you cant look away from and dont want to look away from
May 7 2022,positive,the movie is fun because of the sound and visuals it doesnt have some sort of amazing plot or storyline its very norse mythology and i thought that was interesting but mainly it is loud men fighting so if thats what you want to see this is the movie for it overall i liked it but i didnt go to it expecting a lot
May 7 2022,positive,what an eye opening and amazing journey this was the most accurate depiction of norseman lives in those times i have ever seen gruesomely poetic
May 7 2022,negative,not good  acting was bad actually considered leaving half way thru had high hopes since i was a viking series fan but this fell flat 
May 7 2022,negative,stupid  save your money  hollywood lost its ability to show a story
May 7 2022,negative,weak storyline no character development predictable outcomes now imagine 2 hrs of it
May 7 2022,negative,a lot of blood and mayhem not much plot
May 7 2022,negative,too much manroaring seriously
May 7 2022,negative,what did i even just watch horrible on every single point of the movie
May 7 2022,positive,the story line was very good and the acting was top class
May 7 2022,positive,this is my second time seeing it it just gets better and better cast and crew just an amazing job on the movie northman is worth more than 5 stars alexander skarsgard never disappoints cant wait to buy this on dvd
May 7 2022,negative,the action scenes were good but very gruesome and there werent enough of them the movie was weird and hard to follow if i wasnt in the theater i would puke have turned it off
May 6 2022,positive,with a single word id call it primal        made me think of the revenant with dicaprio or unforgiven with eastwood       little bit to theater like for my taste could have lived with a less over the top version myself
May 6 2022,positive,acting was great nicole kidman said thank you that he killed her but that wasnt developed enough  the movie was probably 12 hour too long
May 6 2022,negative,just not my kind of movie
May 6 2022,positive,this film is a brutal epic thatll blow your mind gorefilled authentic and unrelenting the northman is an easy contender for movie of the year
May 6 2022,negative,this was perhaps the worst movie i have ever paid to see acting was horrible and zero plot  do not waste your money or time
May 6 2022,neutral,lovely cinematography and a confused mishmash of a story theres a reason norse epics are better as written word not as runes tho which this was the movieversion thereof
May 6 2022,positive,camera work was brilliant the scenery of awesome of iceland but the negatives were weirdly placed comic relief some acting was poor storyline was normal and some of the cgi was noticeable bad 
May 6 2022,positive,spectacular movie lots of gore but delivered on the story and viking ideals
May 6 2022,positive,while it may labour a bit much for some this epic tale still makes for good viewing while nothing special it has its merits mainly in its beautiful visuals visceral soundtrack and intense action however these dont complete make up for some questionable writing and slower pace
May 6 2022,negative,drop acid before you go see it and let me know if it makes it better its awful
May 6 2022,negative,most overhyped movie ive ever seen plodding dialogue and wooden acting with cobbledtogether mythology nicole kidman and ethan hawkes phony scandinavian accents made me want to drill an ice pick into my ear that someone could make a brilliant film like the lighthouse then produce a film tommy wiseau would be embarrassed to claim boggles my mind
May 6 2022,negative,im torn is this the merely worst movie that ive seen in a long time or is it the worst movie ive ever seen no character development terrible acting and directing the thinnest of plot lines no chemistry between alexander skarsgard and anya taylor joy which makes sense because they are both utterly lacking in defining character traits other than revenge and taylorjoys bizarre accent nicole kidman should have passed on this one  her scene with askars was both cringeworthy and laughable lots of the overly long running time spent on weird dancing around the fire scenes rather than developing a story line or characters  but i forget  its hamlet with vikings that makes it high brow right lame lazy doesnt substitute for the work of making a watchable movie the only thing  that could have redeemed this bag of hot trash is more scenes of alexander skarsgard shirtless and they even blew that dont waste your time stream vikings or the the last kingdom
May 6 2022,negative,awful  no story line to speak of and way too much violence no character development love alexander starsguard  but this is not one of his best
May 6 2022,negative,this is the worst movie i have seen in the last few years i love alexander skarsgård and was so looking forward to this movie i was expecting a down to earth revenge movie with one of my favorite actors instead i wasted my money on a toolong fever dream mindbinder with an incoherent plot with characters that make inexplicable decisions dont say i didnt warn you
May 6 2022,positive,fantastic  a fever dream into the viking world a tale of selfdiscovery betrayal and the unyielding forces of love and hate  visually one of the best films ive ever seen  never boring always a little weird worth full price  see it in the nicest theater you can
May 6 2022,negative,really bad movie i would wait till it comes on tv
May 6 2022,negative,the cinematography was amazing but i swear if i hadnt see the last kingdom on netflix first i wouldve taken a nap while trying to watch
May 6 2022,positive,i liked it this movie seems to polarize people  you like it or hate it i read the reviews here but i wanted to see it myself i dont think theres anything like this movie out there it does bring you back to the viking era theres violence and gore but i dont think it was gratuitous i thought it blended well the acting was terrific ive seen the actress in other movies and shes great the northman was good too the mix of cgi was well thought out and didnt take over the movie like something from marvel
May 6 2022,positive,one of the best medieval movies ever a revenge movie and historical accurate cant wait to have it on bluray
May 6 2022,positive,this is really is a cinematic masterpiece one word spectacular   not for the squeamish  amazing film   
May 6 2022,negative,if i could give this negative stars i would  i would rather watch paint dry than watch this long convoluted movie with the worst acting ive seen again
May 6 2022,positive,mesmerising and really gripping even if bleak enjoy the gotesque skullduggery
May 6 2022,positive,unexpected and entertaining a liveaction saga bloody and mystical just be patient
May 6 2022,positive,they kept the legendary feel of the sagas and the images and mythology was amazing the actors knew what they had to do and they nailed it i was totally absorbed
May 6 2022,negative,the movie is not that good i gave it a 55
May 6 2022,positive,sure not everything works but more things land that dont  and when it hitsit slaps there are a few scenes in particular which taken in isolation are amongst the best in film today the northman is more ambitious and much larger in scale than  eggers previous films the vvitcvh and the lighthouse as a result the film feels a bit rough around the edges and where his previous works are polished gems the northman feels more akin to a large uncut diamond the romantic element of the film felt a bit rushed and the storys resolution left something to be desired however more than anything eggers succeeds at bringing close the alien world of 9th century viking europe in a lovely arthouse form its feral barbaric and spiritually raw ohand its bloody and yet i cant help but wonder what the northman would be if eggers had retained final cut of the film and if a24 had taken on the project themselves
May 6 2022,positive,entertaining and a good story felt like a made for netflix kind of movie but still good if you need to chill for 2 hours
May 6 2022,positive,a little long but it did entertain really great twists  turns in terms of lighting it was very dark loved the plot and story line thoroughly enjoyed the action and movie
May 6 2022,positive,movie was just ok for hype it wasnt worth it
May 6 2022,positive,it was weird i if they took out the weird part maybe a higher star
May 6 2022,negative,gratuituous violence no character development woodenly acted
May 5 2022,positive,its fascinating that this is both a really weird and really straightforward movie it takes some magical realist turns but some of those turns give you the rundown of the major plot points that are to come get sword fight on lake of fire volcano leave behind maiden king queen odd choice it seems like they wanted to raise up questions of fate but everything followed his prescribed fate to a tee without much wrestling with that fact but the prophecy and the similarity to hamlet which is drawn from the scandanavian legend of amleth this film is based on makes this a familiar story so there were no real surprises the nicole kidman bit might function as a solid twist for some people but you have ethan hawke and the kid acting like wolves in front of a smiling willem dafoe a witch with beads coming down to be her eyes a skelly fight etc these things work together to make it engaging thats for sure the true reason this gets a 4 beyond alexander skarsgaards insane physique and physical performance is that it undeniably immerses you into this nordic culture and this icelandic scenery many images were stuck in my mind days after seeing it and thats a testament to crafting an atmospherethe most elusive and most impressive of a directors duties
May 5 2022,neutral,interesting at times but more weird than anything beautiful shots i just wished the first hour was more like the last 30 min
May 5 2022,positive,another stunning cinematic masterpiece i have seen so many bland saccharine corporate movies over the last year it was really refreshing to see something so visceral and compelling
May 5 2022,positive,not the perfect movie i so wanted it to be but the performances and artistic direction combined with the world building and lorethrilled me i just wish the pacing before the final act could be smoother and the film was 1520 mins shorter
May 5 2022,positive,the northman is a fantastic movie if you want a by the numbers revenge thriller then this is not the motion picture for you the narrative structure tends towards the artsy side of the scale but is handled well overall incredible scenery punctuated by intense violence the northman is a thoughtful story that some may find overindulgent but i found just the movie i wanted to watch in this age of reboots sequels superhero movies and just plain bad lazy movies this movie stands out as a wonderful example of the art of high cinema
May 5 2022,negative,extremely slow odd and we almost walked out i dont understand why people thinks it is great because it isnt for many reasons in my opinion if you find the previews a little strange wait until you see the movie
May 5 2022,negative,it was the most confusing movie i have possibly ever seen
May 5 2022,positive,the northman plays like a subversive version of gladiator maximus with mommy issues while it isnt a straightforward crowdpleaser it is compelling and gripping throughout its run time and its guaranteed to boost your testosterone
May 5 2022,negative,this was by far one of the worst movies ive ever seen i was so excited to see this movie when i saw the trailer completely mislead by the trailer nothing but a weird mystical dull revenge movie the violence was expected but how they did it was just ridiculous for someone who watches all the viking shows and movies this was such a disappointment we got up an walked out when his mom kissed him we had simply had enough no charcter development way to loud could barley understand what people were saying just terrible
May 5 2022,positive,best film ive seen in years
May 5 2022,positive,like eggers previous films the northman is beautiful haunting and brutal the movie takes its time and plays out unapologetically faithful to the mythology on which it was built fantastic performances across the board and keeps eggers touch in every frame see it on the big screen
May 5 2022,positive,it was good but weird
May 5 2022,positive,fantastic that era of history is so underexplored this film captures the brutality and the mysticism so perfectly if you liked the witch or the lighthouse you will like this
May 5 2022,positive,its definitely not for everyone  think hamlet but with vikings  some imagery is visual expressionistic theres also some fantasy elements  overall i liked the movie  but i dont think the general public will appreciate it they seem to like spoon fed movies made for simpletons
May 5 2022,positive,this film is basically is probably one of the best films of the year gives a realistic take on realworld history that most hollywood movies dont touch on when scorcese was talking about cinema this is the type of movies he was talking about
May 5 2022,positive,a great movie i didnt expect to like it so much nevertheless do not overestimate expectations this is a strong drama in the stunning style of the early middle ages with their customs and culture or rather religious obscurantism
May 5 2022,positive,cinematic and a worthwhile watch on the big screen  excellent performance from the cast though i didnt find the leading man charismatic at all  despite a strong start the story goes a bit soft near the end and the ending was somewhat rushed    nevertheless a trippy norse epic worth sampling
May 5 2022,positive,hard to follow and while the actors face good performances the storyline itself was la king
May 5 2022,negative,this was just an absolute mess ive only walked out on 2 movies in my life and i just barely didnt walk out of this one and while i didnt walk out 4 other people did at the showing i was at visually it was great but they kept adding trippy spiritual scenes in an attempt to be deeper i guess but they did a terrible job with them want an idea of what im talking about how about when the father and son are asked to act like crazy dogs while growling and barking at each other for 5 whole minutes then the shaman getting in their face and tells them to prove that their men so the son pushes hard andfarts seriously this wasnt meant to be funny they meant it as some part of religious ritual and it was supposed to be spiritual utterly stupid movie so disappointing
May 5 2022,negative,i see a lot of films and left halfway through the northman two reasons both violence related  the amount and manner of violence was over the top      also and perhaps more importantly is how the director choose to show the violence  close camera shots throats slit faces  skulls smashed blood lots of blood  ironically a man sitting two seats away from me seemed to be in pure ecstasy with every violent scene i could hear and see him taking it all in enjoying the vision of pain suffering and death  a smf    not my kind of movie
May 5 2022,positive,it was different but not a bad movie
May 5 2022,neutral,very nicely shot  and wild wild story line its a 253 for me 
May 5 2022,positive,i felt it dragged on at times but for the most part it was incredibly engaging though the revengedriven plot was not hard to figure out the journey to the revelations was still enjoying to watch artistically this film was spectacular in look and feel  it felt epic i personally really enjoyed the mystical elements of the mythologies would definitely recommend
May 5 2022,positive,incredibly well done and entertaining fantastical too  just the right amount of everything
May 5 2022,positive,a shot of testosterone
May 5 2022,positive,so far id say its the best movie of the year in my book
May 5 2022,positive,ethan hawke makes the most of his limited screen time while the rest of the cast draws you into a dark fairytale the plot isnt groundbreaking but how its executed is worth the price of admission 
May 5 2022,negative,very violent and tedious
May 5 2022,negative,northman went south early viking ships approaching land next scene men on horseback arriving back from battle what did i miss  nicol kidman showed up on the wrong set she should have been at rupenzel the music not music was basically loud sound effects that did nothing for the movie  i just cant believe anyone actually liked this crap  if you saw gladiator and gave it 5 stars that was the bench mark northman isnt worth 30 seconds of gladiator i only stayed in the movie because friends took me otherwise i would have enjoyed being at home sleeping btw the movie was in black and white for all intents and purpose if you are smart and avoid this movie be sure to bypass it on netflix as well
May 5 2022,negative,the first time i looked at my watch was about 30 minutes in and i new this was going to be a rough ride  this is a long slow moving dull revenge story the violence is incredibly uneven feeling very pg13 early on and then over the top by the end i dontmind violence in fact it was notoriously absent at the beginning which made the ending almost absurd at times  this huge cast overactive the heck out of this and honestly the movie is just weird a lot  i know they were going for the norse mythology to me it failed on so many levels this will most likely be on my list of worst of the year
May 5 2022,positive,visually appealing good story line
May 5 2022,positive,the viking theme with the special effects made this a hit  glad i went to see it
May 5 2022,positive,a very strong revenge story with a very artistic style to it that you would expect from robert eggers
May 5 2022,positive,the northman is what i had hoped it would be based on the trailer the cast and robert eggers i wanted bigtime epic quest i got a seriously epic quest i wanted intensity when it was needed and subtlety as well i got each quality but especially beautiful intensity i wanted what i perceive to be nordicicelandic mythology played out in ways that seemed authentic for me so i wanted viking clashes ships at sea carrying warriors and their hard fought spoils i wanted dark pagan magic in the form of shamanic figures casting spells and foretelling fates i got that all  the production values on the northman are what you can only hope for  locations production design art direction sound visual effects are stellar and obviously its a gorgeous film from opening to the closing shot much credit to niamh coulter for set decoration as well  most of the credit will go leads skarsgård and taylorjoy  writerdirector eggars and cowriter sjón for this outstanding screenplay and directorial choices to fully bring out the main themes and ideas of the film as well as the realism and barebones screaming mad rush of the chosen time place people and cultures   skarsgaård is spoton perfect casting imo his experience physical presence and power and his great range as an actor screamed for him to play amleth anya taylorjoy has been a big favorite of mine for years now shes a remarkably skilled actor and along with her extraordinary singular beauty she is a riveting presence on the screen   kidman is wicked fiery and fearlessly smoldering bang embodies the figure youre to hate so well hawke was surprisingly convincing dafoe was a hoot though alltoobrief i can say the same for bjorks intense cameo i thought both young actors as two of the youngest sons were both quite good   im sure a good many viewers are giving this lesser reviews due to how it ended but im not one of those looking for all my heroes or protagonists to get it all and live happily sappily ever after im a big grownup boy and i know thats not how this story line is likely to play out my advice watch lifetime and read nicholas sparks  this film knocked me out people woofrigginhoo 42 stars
May 5 2022,negative,too long loud and ridiculous
May 5 2022,neutral,visually artistically cinematically stunning however it was like a 2hour viking dream sequence
May 5 2022,positive,norse hamlet  enough said
May 5 2022,negative,did not enjoyed neither the story or all the violence  
May 5 2022,positive,dude honestly one of the best revenge stories ever such a great movie i cant say it enough absolutely go see it in the theaters before its too late
May 5 2022,positive,movie to dark and too loud and was in hurry for it to be over
May 4 2022,positive,robert eggers is at it again with another artistic film the northman is a revenge film that follows viking prince amleth on his quest to avenge his fathers death this film contains so much surrealism yet realism at the same time is what made films like eggers other film the lighthouse so exquisite the special effects in this film were both special and effective especially in multiple fight scenes like the raid on the slavic village the acting performances from alexander skarsgård anya taylorjoy ethan hawke and willem dafoe was excellent last but not least the music in this film composed by robin carolan and sebastian gainsborough was so powerful and emotional i was filled with so much excitement i personally think that the northman is one of the greatest films ever made and i honestly think this film has the potential to become an oscar winning film
May 4 2022,negative,very slow i went to sleep 3 times
May 4 2022,positive,watched this today a few hours ago i was a bit uneasy of paying the extra fees for the cinema for reclining chair that was not even that reclining but did not have a say in the matter but pay i went alone and had to wait for almost 10 minutes for the film to start due to a technical issue in the cinema with each minute getting closer to midnight i was getting anxious and contemplating to leave and just ask for a refund     however i decided to stay and be patient once the movie started i realised i was going to watch something i have never seen before quite like it this movie has everything you could imagine this movie was not created for the woke culture and the im offended by even the sight of a bee kind of people these days this movie takes you places you will never be in your wildest dreams    the nicole kidman character was such a wonderful surprise i sank into my seat that wasnt even reclining i must say the movie was worth all the fees i could ever pay it was worth the admission of every film i have ever watched before i kept saying they deserve more than what i paid more than my mortgage the work they put into it deserves so much from film and story lovers everywhere    i have to say every critic who gave or even thought or spoke of giving this film less than five stars should be fired from their jobs immediately and never be able to watch a film remotely like this ever again to every audience member so many who chose to give less than 5 stars stuck to cartoon and family friendly films please thats all you deserve to ever see
May 4 2022,negative,worst movie ive ever seen in a theater prince amleths voice is over modulated the plot was very obvious it was shot very dark if movies werent so expensive i would have walked out
May 4 2022,positive,i liked the story line and the location scene of the movie
May 4 2022,positive,there were some terrific things and some not so terrific things about this movie  on the good side a few good plot twists cool nordic vibe including bad a prophecy scenes great views of iceland excellent accents  acting from anya taylorjoy  nicole kidman  on the notsogood side 1 super gross ultraviolence if you liked the 300 2 they took alexander skarsgaard a ridiculously good looking man and made him look awful  he spent half the movie hunched over filthy and growling like a beast and yes i get that was part of the premise but still icky to watch 3 it was wayyyyy too long and didnt pass the momstaysawake test in the middle but i woke up for the last 13 and felt like i didnt miss anything by falling asleep for a while and last but not least 4 it was just too depressing  i mean im not asking for a rom com here but this movie was dark and glorified revenge violence  with everything going on in the world right now that might not be the best message to be spreading we might all end up blind  toothless if everyone runs with it
May 4 2022,positive,great movie not just a dumb blockbuster action movie but it really gets into native european faith     great camerawork as well and acting the storyline is kind of basic but the rest makes up for it
May 4 2022,positive,straight forward no nonsense tale of revenge  also nicely weaved subtle elements surrounding the involvement of the gods  just enough of it to maintain the flavor of norse mythos without overdoing it  fantastic film
May 4 2022,positive,a bit slow in the beginning and confusing  send half picked up and easier to follow
May 4 2022,negative,wanted to love this movie but i didnt played like kill bill which i adore without any semblance of a sense of humor the hyperviolent action sequences were well done the photography was spectacular the script was ridiculous if you like overwrought acting swelling music and and swelled lats and unexplained and unexplainable plus downright goofy voodoo magic camouflaged as viking myth then this will be your perfect cup of tea i prefer my coffee smart ultraviolent and funny thank you very much
May 4 2022,negative,the same scenes shown in the trailers are great but it depicts a proper action movie and not a half spiritual  half slow path to revenge which was the case all along the movie   its a good movie to watch at home  not so much to watch in the cinema
May 4 2022,negative,boring convoluted and disappointing
May 4 2022,positive,best movie i have seen in years the movie does a great job at drawing the viewer into religious ceremonies and experiences that are extremely odd from a christian perspective those scenes pull you in allowing you to experience them with the characters leaving you with an innate understanding of the emotions the characters are experiencing what is happening and why but without overt exposition it is one of the best displays i have ever seen of religious experience in film and it is done over and over throughout the piece the characters are far more real than the 1dimensional characters we are normally given in the film amleth battles with who he is supposed to be and who he wants to be with what he remembers from his childhood and the reality around him it is a phenomenal and very real tale of coming to terms with childhood trauma and deciding who to become i enjoyed every second and was sad when it ended i cannot wait for more from this director
May 4 2022,negative,awful  bad dialogue bad story line everyone looked the same why did kidman do this
May 4 2022,positive,disneys longawaited liveaction remake of the lion king is stellar their decision to reset it in vikingera iceland is a bold daring move which deserves our applause
May 4 2022,negative,not what  expected  jumped all over the place no real plot  all about revenge
May 4 2022,positive,i understand if other people didnt enjoy this movie all that much for those who liked robert eggers previous entries however this movie was a splendid treat the atmosphere and the rawness of the movie kept me glued the whole time and the viewer is rewarded with a developing plot that unravels into a shocking surprise towards the end and questions whether the ends justify the mean fantastic movie and highly recommend if slowburns are your thing and norse stuff lol
May 4 2022,positive,surprisingly good great cinematography good acting  i went in expecting a typical action film but this movie is much more than that
May 4 2022,positive,good story and acting quite violent but that was expected
May 4 2022,positive,havent been real impressed by a movie in a while the northman was the perfect actor and the women with him as well great classic tale but with the best ending ive seen in a long time
May 4 2022,positive,very hard to understand because of the heavy accent
May 4 2022,negative,this was a fantasy movie and i was expecting an action movie
May 4 2022,positive,its complicated half of the things are so good but the other half is cringe and over the top at least the director good or bad is making an impact
May 4 2022,negative,it was ok nothing like gladiator thats for sure
May 4 2022,positive,greatest movie ever other than interstellar
May 4 2022,negative,  i watch all the viking shows  but this movie doesnt take the time to make you care about any of the characters the lead simply walks around standing awkwardly with his head down and kills people  the only part i enjoyed was him as a young boy admiring his father  dont waste your time with this one
May 4 2022,negative,nonsensical mix of violence and the supernatural the plot is a typical revenge movie that fizzles out in the end with no hero   norse mythology gods used to confuse the name even elicits that the northman is located elsewhere other than in the north fact is they were all northmen except for someone from scotland  the only redeeming feature was the accents of the dialogue being norwegian come danish
May 4 2022,positive,a brutal masterpiece that takes its time although not for everyone the northman immerses us in the story of the viking amleth with stunning visuals an intense score brutal action and the age old epic tale of vengeance under the fantastic direction of robert eggers  not a viking battle fest of nonstop action but  a slow burn story that takes its time utilizing both style and substance absolutely incredible i truly felt the intensity of this film and i hope you do too
May 4 2022,negative,horrible movie i wouldve paid extra to end it sooner
May 4 2022,positive,awesome film it has an amazing story
May 4 2022,positive,one of the most original films ive seen in a very long time some of the scenes were amazing to watch and make you wonder how they filmed them i could see it getting nominated for best cinematography
May 4 2022,positive,the movie too slow it dragged on a lot
May 4 2022,negative,the northman is poorly mismarketed as an actionpacked viking epic when it is as a matter of fact nothing of those sorts apart from its underlying tone of action it is more of a wannabe art piece that fails at everything such a film would try to convey it lacks a narrative foundation on which an engaging plot can be built it lacks any sort of character development and the plot hasnt but a single grain of logic while being a disjointed wreck but why is it so dont get me wrong i wasnt looking for action only when i went into the theatre with some little knowledge of the film i was looking forward to seeing a compelling story somehow they missed every key point    character our character doesnt grow a single inch as a person throughout the 2hour runtime he is cruel and vengeful and stays cruel and vengeful although many occasions of character growth present themselves throughout the film most likely by the pure whim of the screenwriters    plot honestly i dont know what to say much other than that i didnt understand a lot from it it is an utterly disjointed mess with no grain of logic to hold it together as what can be called a plot its as if the screenwriters wrote at their whim forgetting what happened along the way from mindbogglingly awful plot twists with no emotional impact to random shoehorn moments to moments that made no sense in terms of motivation and character decision this film didnt stick together for a single second its as if the writers wrote themselves into a corner numerous times and wrote in the most awful of awful deus ex machina situations the creative decisions in this film are seriously horrendous    style i would have expected a more human story rather than a misplaced mystical mess scenes are artistic and long to say the least for no reason other than to be well artistic while also sacrificing possibly valuable character moments i and probably many other people in the audience werent precisely enthralled by the arthouse wannabe masterpiece that unfolded itself before us although i have to admit i was curious as to what possibly worse turns this movie could take and it certainly did not disappoint in that regard    acting although the actors are certainly talented this was a waste of their potential every scene involving some sort of drama was downright pathetic and lame as the film didnt draw us close to the characters and their possible growth for a single second probably because they didnt have much to work with    overall this film is a disjointed and meaningless mess that doesnt accomplish anything in a fairly decent runtime its definitely not a film worth wasting your time
May 4 2022,positive,too long lost intrest
May 4 2022,positive,one of the best movies ive seen in a while me and my gf walked outta the movie blown away really fantastic visceral story wow
May 4 2022,positive,this movie was a visual feast with a compelling plot that still took unexpected turns anybody saying its a poor film is either dull or soft 
May 4 2022,positive,think of it as the scandinavian hamlet that it is
May 4 2022,negative,i tried i really did it just didnt compete with the last kingdom or vikings for me while i respect the differences something just didnt click it was a no for me
May 4 2022,negative,long and pretty depressingslow was not walk out worthy but the thought crossed my mind
May 4 2022,negative,horrible acting for such great talent disjointed scenes and horrible transitions ocd did not allow me to walkout but i want my time back
May 4 2022,positive,great atmosphere good acting
May 4 2022,positive,great acting brutal story
May 4 2022,negative,walked out of the theater no more than 30 minutes into the movie
May 4 2022,positive,if you love classic great production revenge tales the northman is a great film story of vengeance love and responsibility will definitely buy on blu ray
May 4 2022,negative,immediately no did not meet my expectations amazing plot was ruined by utter weirdness
May 4 2022,negative,i never review movies this was no joke one of the worst movies i have ever seen as bad as the last airbender i am actually baffled at how bad that script and creative decisions were
May 4 2022,positive,there were shades of vikings from the history channel but it was far from it  it had far too much hocuspocus intertwined with the action scenes which were generally very well done
May 4 2022,positive,it was just a little bit too bloody and gory other than that it was okay movie
May 4 2022,negative,over concentration on the northmans history  when we finally caught up to his present day and what he was doing about his revenge it was good  satisfying ending
May 4 2022,positive,the story was incredible and interesting
May 4 2022,negative,if i could give it less than 0 stars i would very slow and quite strange and a bit disjointed
May 3 2022,positive,this movie is a masterpiece robert eggers has a huge future ahead of him
May 3 2022,positive,not enough violence and slow at times but yes i loved it and not just because i have scandinavian viking blood skol
May 3 2022,positive,combines elements of previous eggers movie with his now trademark style of historical accuracy mixed with mystical story telling not quite the landmark viewings of the previous features but a fine movie still
May 3 2022,positive,although i generally liked the northman  the basic storyline  the movie was a little too long and could have been a half hour shorter there were characters  a few scenes in the movie that were totally unnecessary  did nothing to move the story forward removing some of the excess like the dancing around the fire scene  would have greatly benefitted the movie and as a sidenote  why did the valkyrie look like she was wearing braces i dont think that braces existed in 895
May 3 2022,positive,such a great movie i watched it twice and loved every minute of it
May 3 2022,positive,this is a beautiful movie very mythical and bizarre at times  a perfect depiction of how weird and crazy the times were in that era i truly dont understand the negative reviews for this movie action packed dramatic romantic cinematic plot twists heroes and villains at every turn one of the best movies ive seen in a long time i stand strong by my opinion of this film
May 3 2022,positive,breath taking visual and a likable revenge story
May 3 2022,negative,it was unrelentingly grim and while the performances were mostly good i just didnt care about these barbaric pitiless characters  including the protagonist from what i know of vikings the movie was accurate in its depiction of this warlike culture where respect for human life was nonexistent and glorious battle was all that mattered sadly historical accuracy doesnt necessarily make for good film making id give this one a pass
May 3 2022,positive,interesting cinematography and plot good acting
May 3 2022,positive,production value is worth it alone for me was a unique film of the typical vengeance story there is so much testosterone in this film you may grow a few beard hairs just watching it
May 3 2022,negative,exactly the opposite of what i was expecting  dialog was difficult to understand at times
May 3 2022,positive,the whole movie is great but the ending sucked
May 3 2022,positive,movie was okay ending wasnt great
May 3 2022,negative,weird movie when the father and son start howling thats when i knew it wasnt going to be good 
May 3 2022,negative,just watch conan the barbarian and even that was a b movie not sure what this was
May 3 2022,negative,i really wanted to love this movie but i was disappointed i had been waiting to see this for almost 2 years and my expectations may have been too high there was a lack of depth character development and the story seemed to jump around a lot i love norse mythology but i think they tried to be too artistic and vague with it it was a let down
May 3 2022,negative,i tried not to laugh we left during the dance around the campfire that could have been a bad rendition of the macarena at a viking wedding then i did laugh
May 3 2022,negative,the producers must have held nicole kidmans children hostage to get her to appear in this miserable film
May 3 2022,negative,this movie was awful dont waist your time and money
May 3 2022,negative,awful movie i was so hopeful after all i read about it but found it very hollywoody the vikings tv series was much more real and interesting
May 3 2022,negative,photography and epics are ok however you should expect 3 hours of extreme unnecessary violence and blood  the film script is hackneyed uninteresting and could be related in 3 minutes or less  i still wonder how the producers convinced nicole kidman to take part
May 3 2022,positive,epic brutal and beautiful the kind of movie that rarely gets made these days a mustsee
May 3 2022,positive,fabulous  held your attention through out close to viking folklore  the film is a bit gory for those of a weak stomach story line is good scenery breathtaking
May 3 2022,positive,its just topnotch filmmaking there are quibbles to be had with the story and the waxing and waning of character motivations ie fate but it is a beautiful epic gritty emotional impeccably shot perfectly acted powerhouse of a film it is so intentional and so clearly envisioned an a director at the top of his game
May 3 2022,positive,some could find problems to digest it but this is an amazing piece of art almost a mystical experience if you see it with the right perspective if you want a popcorn movie this is not and thanks god sorry eggers
May 3 2022,positive,maybe because most of them have strong accent so hard to understand their english now i wish there is subtitle on the screen     lots of screaming in this movie many violent bloody fights very graphic storyline wise didnt really catch my attention
May 3 2022,positive,fantastic historical thriller  nothing like previous movies about danes or vikings  nice to have an adult movie without superheroes robots or zombies   a movie not for the whole family as even the hero is a ruthless murderer
May 3 2022,negative,dark left me with a really bad taste
May 3 2022,positive,loved it needed a bit more action but its a beautifully shot interesting movie
May 3 2022,positive,i think the word saga comes from some norse language so technically any of their adventures would be a saga sometimes its not that exciting though like in this movie its beautifully shot a study in mud and grey skies but theres just not enough there to sustain itself they give it all away in the previews  prince sees the king slain swears revenge takes the rest of his life getting it great performances all around but left wanting
May 3 2022,positive,the movie was well written well shot and the acting was stunning
May 3 2022,neutral,the northman is the lion king with vikings lots of blood and a twist here and there even they copied the final scene between simba and scar meh
May 3 2022,positive,best movie of the year
May 3 2022,negative,my husband and i were drawn in by the trailer movie had great visuals but was just weirdhuge disappointment 
May 3 2022,negative,anyone with a desire to go back to viking times should see the northman anyone with the desire to see the mostly barren landscapes of northern ireland and east iceland should see the northman everybody else should probably see something else although the film shows some fabulous landscapes and nittygritty detail of life in the time of vikings it has a plodding storyline that drags you through 2 hoursplus of mud and gore and vague religious rites the cinematography and acting were fine but the story is just so  blah i think that is a viking term but not sure as a lot of the dialogue in the northman is about as clear as the fog rolling across the plain
May 3 2022,positive,master of fate by fate mastered or is he
May 3 2022,positive,the story was wonderful the imagination of the director and acting from the cast was brilliant the final fight was pretty awesome too
May 3 2022,positive,robert eggers absolutely nailed change to the heavier action format my only hope is that a directors cut comes out that shows his initial vision for the pacing and tempo before the screen tests and revisions in the thestrical cut certain sections do feel a tad rushed compared to his other projects overall though the northman is an gripping and visceral film
May 3 2022,positive,great viking movie with awesome cinematics stupid people wont like it because theyre used to being spoonfed by low iq movies fully recommend
May 3 2022,positive,the storyline was very confusing but i genuinely enjoyed the film
May 3 2022,positive,complex brutal and violent this is not a hack n slash you will find yourself questioning a lot of the events and motives violence made me cringe at times and characters are complex loved it
May 3 2022,negative,can a movie be both slow and rushed at the same time not to mention just weird i got suckered by the trailer and was greatly disappointed
May 3 2022,negative,it felt like an ai wrote the movie i have never seen such a 1 dimensional protagonist before the writing was really lazy as many times things would just happen because fate there were multiple times people wouldnt do something simply because it wasnt in their fate they didnt try to say anything or had any real point for making this movie except simply to make money just another trash movie made by soulless corporates shill
May 3 2022,positive,i thought that he shouldve been a better sword fighter he grew up his whole life only wanting revenge yet he isnt the best sword fighter son of a king got beat up by three weasels on the farm when trying to distract them from killing that girl i wouldve liked to see more kick ass fight scenes loved the sound and great plot overall too
May 3 2022,neutral,really cool visuals just missed with a lagging storyline   just a lot of yelling and howling
May 3 2022,positive,walk in the land of gods revenge is my life
May 3 2022,neutral,it pretty good but the ending was dumb to me
May 3 2022,negative,my wife and i havent walked out of a movie in a long time 
May 3 2022,positive,fantastic a modernmade myth brought to life makes me feel the norse myths i read as a kid
May 3 2022,negative,highly disappointing  overly dramatic in places  weird mix of genres  unrealistic
May 3 2022,positive,i think this movie was way overrated  the dialogue sounds like it came from a bad b movie
May 3 2022,negative,it was too long it tried too hard to be cinematic the lead character wasnt interesting enough the show vikings had better storylines tbh
May 3 2022,positive,an amazing movie absolutely brilliant
May 3 2022,positive,great story great script great acting
May 3 2022,negative,the epitome of overrated netflix kind of pretentious shallow movie devoir any substance
May 3 2022,positive,i like viking movies but the northman was not as good as i thought it would have been a little dark
May 3 2022,positive,it was weird intense and action packed not for the faint of heart an entertaining outing at the cinema overall
May 3 2022,positive,strong familiar plot with lots of norse culture featured you wont find that elsewhere
May 3 2022,negative,walk out before the end of the movie
May 3 2022,negative,very strange and hard to follow especially with the literal darkness and intentional strangeness of the film
May 2 2022,positive,i loved the use of mythology and language to help build the story the overall look and feel was fantastic and the cast performed perfectly
May 2 2022,negative,they took my gorgeous tarzan and turned him into a dirty bloody northman 
May 2 2022,negative,well it was done mostly in the dark therefore small budget starts off with a guy farting  a guy gets his head chopped off put up his rear  dont know if this was a comedy  poor nicole kidman ruined her career
May 2 2022,positive,an arthouse viking epic
May 2 2022,positive,powerful movie and well made  just didnt engage with me emotionally  we sort of knew where the story was going but it didnt matter all that much  still did enjoy the ride and it was really impressive in the theater
May 2 2022,negative,a boy movie that even boys dislike the only redeeming part is ethan hawke
May 2 2022,positive,this was an experience that id doubted hollywood to try the choice and gall of all those that put this work of art together was much appreciated    a more intimate bravehart 20 with a hard focus on destiny bloodline and even some fantasy    a warrior movie with heart    valhalla
May 2 2022,negative,bummed this wasnt a better movie the story was choppy 
May 2 2022,neutral,it was okay lol very predictable action scenes when it wasnt trying to be overly dramatic were good but it was like if  the lion king were played by nordics
May 2 2022,positive,this film is an amazing cinematographic experience   every detail is taken care of in a perfect way   it is truly a breathtaking movie with an impeccable cast  thank you robert eggers
May 2 2022,negative,its not worth it to pay for it at the movies this is one of those movies that you can just wait for it to come on regular tv
May 2 2022,positive,meh it passed the time
May 2 2022,positive,an absolutely beautiful and brutal movie at the same time a tale of hate and revenge robert eggers does it again although i have to say you need a strong stomach for this one
May 2 2022,negative,game of thrones episode is better than this   waste of money
May 2 2022,negative,lousy movie do not waste your time or money to see this bad movie the northman2022rated kind as r i went and saw and paid to see this lousy movie at 215pmct sunday may 01 2022 a few people at the movie when left the lousy movie before it end at about half of the movie when i saw it many others when i saw the movie did not like this movie i wrote my comments here at 123pmct monday may 02 2022
May 2 2022,positive,awesome movie from the beginning to the end  be ready its intense
May 2 2022,neutral,the scenery was gorgeous and the costumes speech set design matched the time period  there were mishaps in the dialogue staging and props  example  size of crows to boats in opening the dead body of the queen dragged out of room looked like a resuscitation annie doll with legs  it was obviously not a person      despite that it kept me entertained
May 2 2022,positive,this is the bigbudget version of eggers cinematic sensibilities and you can just melt it down and put it in my veins its brutal atavistic primal gorgeous sensuous gruesome powerful epic mythicits a gripping journey of a man driven to revenge by a savage code and human frailty my understanding is that eggers didnt get final cut on this and so its not entirely his but what we do get is more than satisfying i cant wait to see this gorgeous masterpiece againand againand again i hope someday there is a directors cut that gives us the entirety of his vision for this tale
May 2 2022,positive,good movie it was real and dark
May 2 2022,positive,the best of robert eggers short yet stellar filmography so far with a larger scale and scope than his previous entries yet just as detailed and honed in on storytelling tastefully brutalistic and strikingly gorgeous the northman harkens back to an older style of filmmaking and delivers as an approachable masterpiece and quite possibly the best story of vengeance ever told in the medium
May 2 2022,positive,robert eggers just like he did with the vvitch and the lighthouse manages to once again submerge the audience into his vision and world surrounding this time his 3rd outing the northman with a simple premise and slowburn approach to highlight the characters and the mythology of the world the film is a home run from a stylistic and narrative standpoint and is delivered through a gorgeous level of cinematography that makes the viewing experience that much more immersive alexander skarsgard and anya taylorjoy are incredible and an all too short appearance by willem dafoe leaves a lasting impression for a film that while not for everyone shows that eggers is the real deal and is here to stay for the foreseeable future
May 2 2022,positive,not as action packed as i had thought but certainly unique in its style
May 2 2022,positive,i watched it without knowing anything about it no trailer no synopsis if only this movie could be more grounded without the supernatural stuff to me it could be perfect
May 2 2022,positive,great action scenes but i felt the story line could have been done better it felt very anti climatic at the end
May 2 2022,positive,we need more movies like this i think the northman excels in alot of places but is not without its missteps    cinematography visuals story fight scenes characters are great     casting is meh i dont know what nicole kidman is doing in this ethan hawke looks too much like ethan hawke to sell it and  anya taylor joy seems only capable of one facial expression william defoe is underutilized imo    the closing scene is a 1010 for me
May 2 2022,positive,great movie directing acting and cinematography were outstanding
May 2 2022,positive,the story itself was okay the visuals were cool
May 2 2022,positive,didnt expect all the weird magic stuff in this heavily marketed realism movie  seems like the movie could have ended in the second act except for a poorly inserted plot device from getting revenge sooner   but enjoyed myself watching characters interact with each other
May 2 2022,negative,basically just blood and guts
May 2 2022,negative,very odd movie unsure if it was trying to be a fantasy or historical tale
May 2 2022,negative,this was not a good movie my entire family was not happy with this movie six of us saw this movie and said it was a waist of money and time
May 2 2022,negative,if you seen the trailer youve seen the movie disappointing but expected if i had nothing to do i dont know if i would waste my time streaming this movie
May 2 2022,negative,kept looking at my watch  netflixs the last kingdom is far superior
May 2 2022,negative,honestly just obnoxiously loud and violent for no reason the story sucked never wanted to leave a theater until now
May 2 2022,negative,poorly done remake combination of got star wars and raiders of the lost ark
May 2 2022,positive,one of the best first acts ive seen in cinematic history you can tell the director loves his job
May 2 2022,positive,masterpiece not anywhere near as violent as some make it seem so they must have low tolerance very accurate in its depiction of both the way of life and religious views of vikings and with the magical realism it even felt like the film itself had a pagan ethos rather than just depicting a moment in history beautiful cinematography and all of the symbolism made perfect sense so any of the comments saying the  movie was dumb or made no sense are merely  demonstrating their own stupidity
May 2 2022,negative,one of the top 3 worst movies i have ever seen
May 2 2022,negative,that was the most stupid movie ive ever watched  2 hours of my life that i will never get back  it was so plain and simple so expected  the plot was ridiculous nothing new nothing original unnecessary long movie   that was disaster
May 2 2022,positive,best movie of the year by far what an absolute masterpiece of a movie loved every second of it the acting cinematography and story were all on point i was fully immersed in this world and was left wishing for sequels
May 2 2022,negative,i literally could not wait til this movie was over i caught myself laughing likewth are we watching it was that bad never letting my bf pick a movie without my input lol
May 2 2022,positive,while i did enjoy the movie immensely this movie is not for everyone if youre not a fan of eggers work maybe read a review first my gf did not enjoy herself    if youve seen the vvitch or the lighthouse both done by eggers you almost know what youre in for its not quite the abstract movie green knight was by far but there are fantastic elements that make you wonder is this really happening    all in all i appreciate the movie for showing you exactly what viking culture was all about and it is gritty as heck some of the scenes had me in tears how awesome they were like when a valkyrie carries off a half dead warrior really well done tribute to the lore    expect hamlet with vikings
May 2 2022,negative,on a level with roadhouse and pointbreak my lowestrated movies ever  truly awful nicole kidman looks like a crazed wirejawed wax skeleton figure of herself i spent much of the movie looking in my lap to avoid the vicious violence if you like that you will love this movie fire axes swords etc if you are 14 and male odds are you may love it
May 2 2022,positive,this is nothing but a big testosterone booster and i love it for that
May 2 2022,negative,two hours of my life i cant get back   this is the most awful movie   if you like constant gore and savagery then its right up your alley   i couldnt feel for one single character and had my eyes averted from the screen for a good proportion of it   no stars
May 2 2022,negative,very unrealistic  the fight scenes were a joke and all but last one looked like armatures doing their first fight scene ever  they burned a building to kill the people they put inside and the next scene shows the thatch roof was gone and the walls were unscathed no depth to the movie  culture scenes a snippet with nothing to tie it to their life style  beliefs eg several scenes of men acting like animals but nothing about the importance of that in their culture  a waste of time and money
May 2 2022,negative,i was really looking forward to seeing this but the best bit about it was the feeling of relief when the end credits rolled if you want a bleak violent view of the viking world then valhalla rising does it ten times better   the northman is overhyped overlong and overrated if we had been streaming it at home rather than watching in the cinema it would have been switched off after ten minutes
May 2 2022,positive,robert eggers is a saving grace for original and creative cinema during a time where everything else thats released feels all too familiar the world and the story drew me in from the very beginning the mysticism was a real treat for those familiar with norse mythology and the sparse moments of action and visceral violence had incredible weight perhaps my favorite movie of 2022
May 2 2022,positive,what a fun ride with everything youd expect but still so so good
May 2 2022,positive,great and thrilling movie robert eggers creates a masterpiece that left me completely in awedefinitely going to watch it again
May 2 2022,positive,amazing and epic movie specially if you love nordic culture mithology great character personalization beautiful scenery fantastic music an excellent portrayal of their ancient life packed with lot of action and blood
May 2 2022,negative,disconnected  ridiculous terrible movie
May 2 2022,negative,compared to vikings and last kingdom this movie is simply poor sorry
May 2 2022,positive,ive never been a huge fan of films of this sort however i must say eggers skarsgård and the cast did an outstanding job bringing this film to life and entertaining outside of the target audience i was absolutely blown away by this film but i can understand it wont appeal to some viewers
May 2 2022,negative,lacking of photography script and special effects not realistic at all
May 2 2022,positive,the beginning was amazing but it started to trickle off towards the end
May 2 2022,positive,robert eggers exemplarily epicnourishingly nordicsensorily succulentmorose masterpiece
May 2 2022,positive,awesome i liked how he bit someones throat out and howled with the dogs
May 2 2022,negative,beautiful cinematography excellent cast  but thats all the good things i can say about this movie  the story was boring the dialog was sparse and hard to understand  at the end of the movie i had a hard time even caring about the protagonist
May 2 2022,negative,was not the war movie i thought it was going to be so dark and evil and i would never recommend it to anyone
May 2 2022,positive,beautiful to look at with a fantastic pounding score just wanted more alexander skarsgård being savage viking
May 2 2022,negative,not a very uninteresting movie due to unreleastic and fictional story main character is does not have good acting skills and not charismatic enough to carry the movie despite having nicole kidman as support 
May 2 2022,positive,very intriguing and captivating movie really enjoyed the presentation and plot that keeps twisting and turning
May 2 2022,neutral,way too many scenes with rituals and spirit worship  may be historically true but it got boring and seemed overdone  slow getting to the obvious ending  dying in combat by the river of fire nice unexpected twist that nicole k  queen wanted king to be dead and be with the brother  i give it a b  c
May 2 2022,negative,this was pretty bad  trudged along just not alot there
May 2 2022,positive,it was decent the ending pissed me off though i wouldnt watch it a second time
May 2 2022,negative,what tf did i just watch 2 hrs of strange yelling and farting
May 2 2022,positive,vengeance     the score was incredible the cinematography and longshots were beautiful so glad i saw this on dolby     brutal and realistic battles gore to the core with hints of humor sprinkled here and there    910
May 2 2022,negative,the viking tv series was so much better
May 2 2022,negative,so loud from the start my ears still hurt and just a generally depressing story about hate and revenge from start to finish
May 2 2022,positive,this is exactly what a viking movie should look like if youve ever watched the vikings tv show then you should definitely check this movie out not a fan of the phony looking fighting but still worth the money and time
May 2 2022,positive,probably the best and authentic viking movie ever made would highly recommend it to anyone who likes realism in movies
May 2 2022,negative,yeah it was weird and not very interestinglots of gratuitous violence and the story was basically boring
May 2 2022,neutral,so much potential  too weird of a story line lots of yelling  but most tv series if the same era have better battle scenes
May 2 2022,positive,great movie and a great story
May 2 2022,negative,a viking version of the oedipus tale  not to my liking
May 2 2022,neutral,i thought it was going to be more like game of thrones lol smh
May 2 2022,negative,it was not even close to the trailer long dark and boring
May 2 2022,positive,a great viking story excellent cinematography and fantastic emotional moments
May 2 2022,positive,tales of revenge intermingled with viking lore  all did a great job of bringing the cruelty and life for  both elite and warrior slave alike  somehow though left wanting more
May 2 2022,negative,dreadful piece of overblown overacted over violent hokum
May 2 2022,negative,one of the worst movies i have ever seen  i wish i could give no stars
May 2 2022,negative,this was a movie that had some serious false advertising that is hard to overcome it is a dramatic dark weird movie
May 2 2022,positive,proper viking bloodbath
May 2 2022,negative,the movie was hard to follow
May 2 2022,positive,cinematography was really good the theatre however had the volume waaaaay to loud otherwise it was really good

May 1 2022,negative,too much mystical weird crap
May 1 2022,positive,this movie was amazing
May 1 2022,negative,as a fan of vikings last kingdom and most movies of the genre i wanted more i read the reviews before watching and so had low expectations i thought it was going to be a 35 and for a while it lingered there its was just strange and annoying at times weird music which felt cheap the support acting at times felt comical rather that realistic it is pretty dark but if youre expecting a big epic with large scale battles and a theme of conquest forget that this is a story of revenge with a relatively small set of characters who you dont really warm too and dont get to know its setting is viking but the story could be any kingdom in the world i watched it in the cinema because i had managed to find the set post production and walked around it it was pretty cool to have walked around the same houses and that gave a boost early on oh yeah i kept wanting to should at the main character to stand up man and fix your posture not sure if this was support to be a weird portrayal of the character or the actors got posture issues in short i would rather watch this at home for free than pay for the cinema i get that some people like the strange portrayal if you like the dark film type but for most i think this will be a disappointment dont like writing negative reviews but this was a hard one 
May 1 2022,negative,i was confused the whole movie for a great cast it was such a confusing movie and cringy
May 1 2022,negative,i was disappointed with the movie i was expecting more action actors were ok 
May 1 2022,negative,i havent left a movie review in a while actually ive never left a bad review but this movie was so bad i decided to share the one star it didnt deserve there is so much i disliked from the beginning to the end that ill just say i disliked the whole thing i was trying to find something positive i could give the movie credit for but theres absolutely nothing worth mentioning there were bad parts horrible parts super uncomfortable parts parts that didnt make sense then the end that was just the movie ending badly plus horrible acting throughout
May 1 2022,negative,terrible we left early
May 1 2022,positive,robert eggers delivers another great film with great cinematography great action and great characters
May 1 2022,neutral,had high hows going in was more of an hbo release had some gaps and really moments 
May 1 2022,positive,i like how deep in norse lore it was it was not a typical revenge story so not for everyone but i liked the way they did it if you thought it was boring or couldnt follow it you just wanted the typical viking blood bath this was different and i for one applaud the direction they took
May 1 2022,negative,do not get the love on this one good story and some decent scenes and action  but way to artsy fartsy and drawn out
May 1 2022,positive,45  brutal and epic  i definitely need to rewatch this one because i feel like my rating could go up significantly  i just need subtitles next time to be sure
May 1 2022,negative,hated the movie it was so violent i had my eyes shut through most of it it was a waste of money
May 1 2022,positive,absolutely thoroughly enthralled
May 1 2022,positive,it was quite different from northmen 2012
May 1 2022,negative,it sucked plot made no sense good main actor but terrible movie
May 1 2022,positive,excellent storytelling
May 1 2022,negative,considering i really like the topic that movie was not good no connection between the characters so no story line to buy in to  just kept waiting for something to happen
May 1 2022,positive,very striking artistic storytelling in a visceral dark world
May 1 2022,negative,dumb and stupid acting and story line
May 1 2022,positive,beautiful and brutal gripping from beginning to end
May 1 2022,negative,movie was very slow movingstory didnt seem to go with some scenesmovie didnt hold interest
May 1 2022,positive,difficult to follow story was a copy of ultrid of the last kingdom on netflix
May 1 2022,neutral,wanted to like this movie more  will need to watch it again to really know what to think  the look and feel reminded me of the reverant but something was missing  had just finished watching the last kingdom series which was phenomenal
May 1 2022,positive,its good a good story but its a lil more action could be used not a bad movie 
May 1 2022,negative,big name actors whos acting was flat they had a very poor plot with a tired storyline  this was the worst movie i have seen in a long time
May 1 2022,negative,storyline was truly all over the place action scenes very good but story jumped a bit too much potentially expected too much from comparisons to similar movies
May 1 2022,negative,safe your money on this one really boring and no storytelling
May 1 2022,positive,it was dragged on longer than it couldve been
May 1 2022,positive,alexander skarsgard is a beast wrapped in norse mythology   an epic tale of betrayal loss love revenge  redemption  the scenery was breathtaking  the cinematography was amazing  i will definitely see it again
May 1 2022,neutral,while this film was beautiful and appeared to be authentic i guess i am surprised that setting with such good actors was so poorly done writing and directing did not help
May 1 2022,negative,i had to resist the strong urge to leave the cinema early unfortunately not my cup of tee
May 1 2022,neutral,dont waste your money on going to see this movie at the theatre  at best it is a watch once and never again movie  it has a decent story line but for all the extra cg stuff that was like watching 300 on an acid trip  i really wanted to like this movie after seeing the trailer which really made the movie look great  however as i was sitting in the theater i found myself looking at my watch and just wishing for it to be over as soon as possible
May 1 2022,positive,good movie but lot less fighting then i expected0r that they suggested
May 1 2022,negative,wanted it to be more historical  instead it was just a piece of fiction  had a little too much fantasy involved with a flying horse and a couple of witches  the fight scenes were laughable  they obviously spent too much on big names instead of a good battle scene
May 1 2022,positive,not as much action as expected
May 1 2022,positive,great movie beautiful cinematography amazing acting powerful music perfectly cast this film grabs you from the beginning and never lets go robert eggers once again proves himself to be one of the best upcoming directors of our age
May 1 2022,negative,this was very dark and gory i wasnt expecting a horror flick
May 1 2022,positive,this is a tale of revenge but also love there is familial love and love based on a meeting of souls yes it is violent but lets not kid ourselves the times and places were violent life was not just a struggle against other people but nature itself the film tells the story of these individuals all flawed trying to figure out how to live their lives and looking to figure out what their lives mean religion plays a strong role in the film but it is the faith of gods that are both more present and communicative than most modern religions portray the cast is fantastic but special praise goes to skarsgaard and taylor joy they express so much and such a range of emotion so much without saying anything kudos to eggers for another amazing piece of film
May 1 2022,positive,great movie admittedly the movie was a bit long but none the less a great cinematic movie and not trying to be a bad guy but i think the low ratings are from people who enjoy more disney avengers type movies
May 1 2022,positive,while i absolutely enjoyed the visuals i found the story and characters leaving much to be desired a good film but not without some ponderous missteps
May 1 2022,positive,if you like viking movies or just a good revenge yarn check out this movie  direction composition acting this one has it all
May 1 2022,negative,worse movie ever a total insult to viewers intelligence half the theater left the movie mid way through you come in thinking vikings or the last kingdom but you get the matrix 3  4 squared    the grades that this movie is getting from critics is proof of the true disconnect they have from actual viewers
May 1 2022,positive,this movie is a modern masterpiece  eggers extreme level of detail pays off with a spectacle unlike any movie made in years  add to that incredible performances from the cast insane action incredible storytelling and vibe that just explodes on the screen this is one of my all time favorite movie watching experiences
May 1 2022,positive,made the gruesome beautiful a lot of attention to detail realistic performances while keeping a somewhat formal style of the sagas
May 1 2022,negative,you will love this film if you like men howling at each other while they slash bludgeon stab  use swords to cut off body parts of each other they all kind of look alike esp because they have dirt on their faces  hoods  helmets on whatever story is hidden in the relentless yelling running around  constant killing of random peasants 
May 1 2022,positive,although at beginning it seems as a classical history about a hero and this path to revenge it has some elements about nordic legends that turn this movie to a very good experience to see i lovd the  gore  i would like to have a little more on it   anna t and nicole k are fantastic and aleksander is amazing
May 1 2022,positive,i was certainly excited for eggers third feature after creating such memorable experiences with his first two but aside from expecting a technically beautiful film was a little worried that this simple and over told plot would not be able to hold my attention this reservation was quickly assuaged as i was immediately transported over a thousand years into the past both visually and mentally gaining such vivid impressions amongst all the muted greys and dreary landscapes    first and foremost this film was visually stunning and created such an easily immersive atmosphere utilizing both the impressively detailed period sets and gorgeous natural landscapes to hold me in an almost trance like state for long stretches of time while the northman definitely offers more plotwise this film was reminiscent of another i love innaritus the revenant which also told a fairly straight forward story with the aid of eyepoppingly beautiful cinematography    eggers really takes this film to the next level for me though by including the spiritual or more mystical aspects of these ancient viking cultures these belief systems are presented in such a creative manner helping to drive the narrative while still keeping them in the realm of the unexplainable and never allowing any spiritual elements to offer concrete evidence or gain an unassailable foothold this way the film always still felt like a historical epic and firmly real never venturing into fantasy while still giving audiences a well researched picture of the other worldly elements that played such a large role in these peoples lives while here    anya taylorjoy stood out most to me among this high caliber cast and i hope to see her create more success with eggers in future projects the acting and score were solid all around as well and usually needs to be in addition to a well honed script and detailed cinematography in order to create the kind of fully immersive experience that eggers pulls off here 8510    2022 theater 14
May 1 2022,positive,the sets and scenes were very realistic made you feel like you were seeing it just about like must have been at that time
May 1 2022,neutral,pretty disappointing stuff from mr eggers i loved the witch and thought the lighthouse was interesting so seeing such a unique directer do a big budget viking film was exciting  from the opening scene i was disappointed instantly the dialogue was off putting the style not dissimilar to the  witch and the lighthouse seemed really self consciously and lifeless in the viking setting i really dont know if he thought this might feel real or shakespearean its basically hamlet or match the viking sagas or whatever but the dialogue is shockingly stilted and over written throughout  then there are the action sequences which are awful people flay about as they get poked by swords it felt like watching an old sword and sandles film from the 50s or an episode of the ateam  then there are the characters everyones a prick the hero is a prick his wife is a prick his mums a prick his dads a prick his uncle is a prick everyone is a prick fair enough i get that the viking age was harsh and i dont think characters need to likeable but when everyone is a borderline psycho it just feels fake and contrived society was harsh the environment is harsh but people are still people  then just individual scenes are cringe for example his uncle leaves him tied up after beating him do they finish him off there and then no lets leave him hanging here  oh whats this on the ground its his magic swordit doesnt appear to worki better leave it here on the ground beside him i hope he doesnt escape its like something out of an old james bond film or adam wests batman the baddy leaves the room after tying up the hero its that dumb no amount of pretentious dialogue can cover it up  so you have a plot that is pretty standard no characters that feel real and dialogue and action that both feel phony
May 1 2022,positive,while the dialogue slips from time to time the film does something special by transporting the audience to another world throughout the duration of the film simple story with great production this movie is entertainment mixed with art
May 1 2022,positive,story and action were on point the mythology
May 1 2022,positive,a real epic with awesome sense of history action that exceeds most other fake chopped up hollywood fight scene trash puts to shame the pop culture vikings of the past decade    a mustsee while its in theatres
May 1 2022,positive,i wish i could comment under how dumb and poorly conceived the negative reviews are
May 1 2022,positive,awesome movie start to finish
May 1 2022,positive,movie was pretty slow and not at all what we expected from the trailers
May 1 2022,positive,the acting was very good however it was way too much gore for me i suppose for the subject matter it made sense but just not my cup of tea
May 1 2022,negative,this is the first time i ever leave a review i really was excited to watch this movie i thought it will be the 300 of the vikings its not i guess you have to be shrooms to enjoy it the dialogue is crap like a 10yr old wrote it it starts out almost as a play the director could not decide what type of movie he wanted to make if you want fantasy whimsical stay with it like in 300 if you want realistic approach like the batmans  stay with it just feel like it was a mess dont waste money on cinema if you are really curious watch at home terrible acting too for me 
May 1 2022,negative,sorry but just no i wanted to like this but no 
May 1 2022,negative,it was awful the acting was just so stilted at 2hrs 17 minutes it felt like six hours i was never so happy to leave a theatre 
May 1 2022,positive,9810 for me fantastic movie with poetic script imagery heroism and the power of controlling ones fate  with choice
May 1 2022,positive,they did a great job of making you feel like you were there with the cinematography and music very authentic
May 1 2022,positive,amazing norse tale artsy and beautiful love it
May 1 2022,negative,uff that was bad the terrible generic plot the final an predictable twist and the final everything made the story unforgettable
May 1 2022,positive,i will give it a 4 out of five mainly for the fact this movie is not for every one theres not an alarming amount of violence that is what id consider graphic but it also is a film that at times can be hard to understand what characters are saying and it is in a world of fantasy which in the film is cuts to abstract visuals making it for some viewers hard to understand what is going on the director is no stranger to abstract visuals and story telling but i feel this movie tones it way down compared to his other films to make it more enjoyable to the average movie goer its a good story good character arc and awesome fight scenes if you were a fan of the lion king as a kid and dont mind a little more of a violent spin on it i think you will enjoy this movie
May 1 2022,negative,really not very good i was expecting more especially with the pretty good reviews it received not sure how
May 1 2022,positive,i always like a good revenge story
May 1 2022,positive,the fight scenes are great  i really liked the way it was split into chapters
May 1 2022,negative,the movie wasnt what i thought it would be   i was expecting something more like the series vikings but this movie wasnt it   it was long  the plot was weak
May 1 2022,negative,incredibly boring for a viking action movie lacks emotions or excitement only the visual part is acceptable in the end a waste of time and money i couldnt wait for it to end
May 1 2022,negative,if characters grunting prancing around a fire in what looks like a diaper and never ending sequences of dreamlikeor nightmare visions is your idea of a good moviethan this ones for you  ohand it lasts for nearly 2 12 hours
May 1 2022,negative,lmao where do i begin are you freaking kidding me since when did you guys start playing low budget movies ive been a viking fan for years and i would like to have the 45 min of my life back and my money the worst viking movie ever would even watch it for free or tv
May 1 2022,positive,a slower burn that ending is shown early on  still very enjoyable to watch
May 1 2022,positive,best movie ive seen in years  years the northman is a small story made into an epic every scene is beautiful  real i felt like i was transported to an ancient pagan village couldnt blink
May 1 2022,positive,if youre expecting 2 hours of mindless marvel style action then do not watch this if youre looking for a dark gritty norse revenge flick that takes its time and is violent and beautifully shot then this is for you
May 1 2022,positive,this is a film that is no doubt well shot the story is fine though i felt as if i was waiting for the film to actually begin only for it to end shortly thereafter the buildup to the climax felt lacking in my opinion
May 1 2022,positive,it was worth watching
May 1 2022,negative,very strange and not in a good way too much emphasis on pagan pageantry instead of the actual story
May 1 2022,positive,this was an awesome tale  loving the viking mythology and depth of story  chilling fight scenes and great action sets  the scope of the film and the   cinematography was stellar   plan to see it again to catch the small things   you may miss in great stories like this  well done indeed
May 1 2022,negative,went in thinking it was going to be an amazing movie left majorly disappointed such a waist of money took everything in me not to fall asleep during this movie my husband almost fell asleep as well
May 1 2022,positive,good plot excellent sceneryenough action to get you through a long movie
May 1 2022,positive,quoting chris if youre looking for a viking action movie this might be a little slow and long if youre looking for a norse myth it is a perfect telling of one amazing film
May 1 2022,negative,i dont typically regret going to the movies but oh my god this movie was terrible bad acting bad cinematography bad story telling just bad
May 1 2022,positive,i am awaited at valhalla
May 1 2022,positive,disappointing but its good
May 1 2022,negative,it was such a letdown i was looking forward to this movie for so long and within the 1st 5 minutes i knew it was awful beyond ridiculous was the burp and fat scene i spent so much money and kept praying it would get better i stayed to the end but was such a waste of my money and time
May 1 2022,negative,one of the worst movies ive ever seen how did they get those main line actorsactresses to be in that  gave up almost 3 hours of my life
May 1 2022,positive,awesome epic a little raw but but probably more realistic
May 1 2022,neutral,liked the action and cinematography  story line very predictable  act three is good until ending  ending very poorspoiler alertno winnerno achieving goals worked for through entire movie big let down
May 1 2022,positive,not as good as i was expecting but still worth watching for those still craving got
May 1 2022,positive,its decent i went in only knowing small details about this so i thought it was going to be a retelling of cu chulainn after the mythology was reworked im glad i was wrong this movie does a pretty good job of shaking up the revenge trope it has the usual introduction of a love intrest that makes the mc question his motives the uncle is the best part about this movie though ive seen it done before but not like this mcs perspective from his younger self seeing the world one way and older mc being able to understand the world better im trying not to spoil it so sorry if this review is done wierdly
May 1 2022,negative,movie was boring waste of money i watched about 1 hour and 10min and i couldnt not finish it because of how boring it was i ended up leaving in the middle of the movie because of my disappointment i do not recommend this movie one of the worst movies i seen in a really long time save your money and see a different one
May 1 2022,negative,the volume of the speaking parts was ok but the music was way too loud you couldnt reduce the music without losing the spoken words the message could have been completed in 2 hours there is a lot of wasted space the end of the movie was rushed not our type of movie
May 1 2022,neutral,it just didnt come accross as a fluid movie more like a stage play filmed actors were stiff and the flow was awkward at times
May 1 2022,positive,fucking awesome dude go see it impeccably made with a great story and incredible performances full of unforgettable sequences
May 1 2022,negative,possibly the worst movie ever madedont waste your money or timethere is no way anyone could have given this dreadful movie a good reviewhorrible
May 1 2022,positive,beautiful amazing charactersstill have no idea what was going on
May 1 2022,positive,do you like vikings anya taylorjoy or bjork this movie is for you
May 1 2022,positive,action packed  definitely for adults   loved every minute
May 1 2022,positive,damn good movie historically accurate beautiful cinematography and a great story my only complaint is that i want more berserker battles 
May 1 2022,positive,this movie is worth seeing for the visual aspects alone filmed on location in ireland its absolutely gorgeous the story itself is an interesting concept but the execution leaves something to be desired    the atmosphere of this movie is really the best thing it has going for it the music feels excellent and authentic and the struggles of daily life arent skimmed over theres also an eversoslight supernatural element which adds just the right amount of mystery into the mix    however i did find the plot a little onenote there are some decent twists that deepen things slightly but the movie still never really explores the outcomes of any of them there are times when it feels like the movie might be growing selfaware and moving away from its gritty but shallow revenge story but it immediately comes up with more excuses to put everyone right back where they were theres no real character development and the moral of the story is not profound in the slightest verging on obvious    its a very wellproduced wellacted and welldirected film but a little more depth would have gone a long way regardless its an entertaining and engaging watch thats hard not to appreciate
May 1 2022,positive,get your viking fix and learn about the story that eventually became hamlet
May 1 2022,positive,revenge epic with a large dose of mysticism and where every character is the hero of their own story
May 1 2022,positive,its ideal if youre looking for a new take on a revenge tale theres a lot of norse themes involved combined with an insane amount of intensity that will keep you thrilled at all times its a very raw experience
May 1 2022,negative,really wanted to like this movie but i just couldnt the storyline as simple and straightforward as is it was was extremely disjointed and unnecessarily hard to follow the action scenes are underwhelming and dull way to much time spent with pointless dialogue
May 1 2022,positive,it was very good i just felt like the movie couldnt finish their thought at times
May 1 2022,positive,adaptation of the story was great cinematography was great and soundtrack was fantastic
May 1 2022,negative,im not sure what is up with a fandango reviews but im telling you theyre all lies this was the worst movie ive seen since midsommar   i love alexander skarsgard but this was awful
May 1 2022,negative,horrifically violent confusing and meaningless
May 1 2022,positive,13th warrior worthy movie was awesome
May 1 2022,negative,terrible story and a total gore fest its a very hard r
May 1 2022,positive,incredible visuals throughout some beautiful and some grotesque excellent acting may be too arthousey for some
May 1 2022,positive,this movie is insane in a fantastic way if you can stomach the violence
May 1 2022,positive,interesting story and decent acting
May 1 2022,positive,saw it twice in the same day soooo good so different every shot is gorgeous
May 1 2022,negative,this had to be the worst movie i ever saw i want a refund
May 1 2022,negative,we left 20 min in when the adult man burped and the little kid farted to prove they were humans over dogs while another guy smelled both we were out
May 1 2022,negative,confusing the ending was terrible
May 1 2022,negative,line dancing vikings it was almost like they were trying to spoof other viking moviesseries
May 1 2022,positive,an amazing tale with a sad but righteous end a movie for the ages 
May 1 2022,positive,a great movie with no underline messages just simple good 
May 1 2022,positive,very good movie and story
May 1 2022,positive,loved it nice graphics
May 1 2022,positive,the visuals were great especially the scenery but the dialogue was sometimes hard to understand and the howling was a little lame loved the mother twist
May 1 2022,negative,i registered for a rotten tomatoes account for the first time just to leave this review this was the worst movie ive seen in maybe a decade completely ridiculous my friend and i laughed at the end so glad it was over terrible acting nonsense plot all over the map too much silly gratuitous blood and guts sketchy random coincidences and far far too long basically its the story of conan all over again told poorly blatant ripoff i cant fathom who these critics and viewers are giving this a thumbs up id rather be forced to watch willow 27 times in a row than sit through this again
May 1 2022,positive,a must see catches you from beginning and holds your attention throughout the whole movie
May 1 2022,negative,worst movie ive watched in a long time cgi was terrible and it felt like i wasted 2 hours
May 1 2022,negative,hard to follow story line wasnt very good alot of action though
May 1 2022,negative,horrible movie dumb  obvious plot weak main character barking was dumb ughhhhhhh
May 1 2022,positive,this is a must see it is beautiful  phenomenal visually stunning
Apr 30 2022,positive,intense and historically accurate
Apr 30 2022,negative,none of the characters were interesting enough to keep me hooked the plot while interesting wasnt that great either i needed something more to keep me engaged its a sub par epic with not much going for it
Apr 30 2022,positive,a bit long and a bit grim but a decent stylish revenge film
Apr 30 2022,negative,this was probably one of the worst movies i have seen was really disappointed with the overall execution of this movie from the burping and farting of the psychedelic ritual to the valkyrie wearing braces and cheesy contacts there were so many elements that could have been improved to make this movie better the accents were so thick it was difficult to even make out the names of main characters there were so many scenes that just did not line up with the storyline and needed more context could have been a great movie if it was executed properly
Apr 30 2022,positive,i thought that the movie certainly was different from most which is what what robert eggers usually delivers  its a very decent film with a good premise  but i would say towards the end that the film loses steam in my opinion  but if youre looking for a different and edgy kind of movie this movie may be for you
Apr 30 2022,positive,absolutely incredible movie i was sweating the entire time so intense the cinematography was beautifully shot between the cinematography and the performances i havent felt like that in a movie before i cant stop thinking about it dont listen to the closeminded people that didnt like it some people cant appreciate a good artsy movie the critics nailed it 
Apr 30 2022,positive,it was not what i expected lots of norse stories and spiritual stuff
Apr 30 2022,positive,it was definitely different than i expected but i loved it visually its amazing it was definitely exhausting and sometimes hard to follow never the less i loved it
Apr 30 2022,negative,the movie was too dark over exaggerated and ethan hawke and nicole kidman were a distraction more than beneficial
Apr 30 2022,positive,like listening the saga of amleth as told by a skald
Apr 30 2022,neutral,completely forgettable
Apr 30 2022,positive,very intense movie story was excellent just be prepared for extreme violence
Apr 30 2022,negative,not sure how to say it it was just bad slow poor fight scenes and acting wasnt what i expected with the level of actors in the film
Apr 30 2022,negative,bad acting so many scenes that were slow and didnt seem to add any value to the movie it felt all over the place and scenes that had the potential for depth were cut short definite waste of money
Apr 30 2022,positive,in a few years well call him master eggers if he continues at this rate we are in the third film and we are also in the third masterpiece has not missed a shot if it goes on so we are all happier the film has a simple plot that is enhanced by a great staging the theatricality of acting and dialogue does not clash and does not disturb everything is embellished by a direction always clear but never banal that is based on technical finesse not to be underestimated but the strong point of the beautiful photography that makes each frame a work of art academy marked this film for the next oscar awards
Apr 30 2022,positive,the northman a huge cinematic masterpiece with the added bonus of the incredible cast of actors although the story was predicable at times and somewhat dragged the audio colours music and scenery were definitely the major points in robert eggers new film any fan of cinema set around the viking era would love the realistic animalistic dark and gritty vibe the film has throughout
Apr 30 2022,positive,a knife in the heart of marvel
Apr 30 2022,positive,great story telling
Apr 30 2022,positive,super intense from start to finish
Apr 30 2022,positive,lots of worship and sacrifice scenes that gave you context of what their world was like but definitely slowed down the movie
Apr 30 2022,positive,incredible eggers greatest
Apr 30 2022,negative,terrible plot and acting
Apr 30 2022,negative,wow i couldnt believe i stayed in the theatre for the whole movie  in my top 5 worst too
Apr 30 2022,positive,movie was good but the sound was extremely to loud
Apr 30 2022,positive,fantastic movie a bit artsy at times but the story progresses quickly and keeps you interested actors did a fantastic job as well
Apr 30 2022,positive,the movie was good and the story line excellent
Apr 30 2022,negative,we all walked out awful especially since it was advertised as viking era acting bad story bad just bad
Apr 30 2022,positive,the northman is a norse tale of vengeance that doesnt shy away from its bloodshed and brutality robert eggers explores how much hatred can make one unredeemable the direction cast and cinematography is outstanding see this in theaters highly recommend
Apr 30 2022,positive,absolutely fantastic movie from start to finish great action and great acting all around
Apr 30 2022,negative,nah i stayed for it all wife went out for popcorn lots of growling very long when will this be over   swimming off the coast of iceland i dont think so  hypothermia special when we were in iceland we were told that if you step off the beach into the water youre on your own because no one will risk their lives to attempt to save you what did they pay nicole to be in this mess  the previews are great but
Apr 30 2022,negative,boring bad action too wierd too blodless for a viking movie yuck
Apr 30 2022,positive,beautifully shot with a wonderful soundtrack it isnt a unique story but it was portrayed extremely well and kept historical accuracy it didnt try to pretty up or sugarcoat anything the northman is a gritty and violent slowburn that was very enjoyable to watch
Apr 30 2022,positive,this is most likely going to be my favorite film of the year the acting cinematography color scoreeverything combined perfectly for an excellent piece of art perfectly paced loved the shot framing so many scenes i felt could be converted into prints or promotional material
Apr 30 2022,positive,the northman is probably one of the best viking tales ive seen in a while the pace of the film may be a bit slow for some people but it still manages to keep you engaged throughout the story the northman is a loud bloody dirty wet and often disturbing movie but its such a good movie so take that for what its worth and go experience robert eggars latest visionary masterpiece
Apr 30 2022,negative,waste of time not worth watching it stay at home and watch vikings instead
Apr 30 2022,negative,very predictable story line nothing really grabbed me my friends said they liked it but for me it was a dud
Apr 30 2022,negative,one of my top 5 worst movies  right up there with the green night and the stanley kubrick brad pitt disaster
Apr 30 2022,positive,  honestly i cant praise this movie enough the acting was fantastic the cinematography was amazing and the sound design was immersive i am looking forward to seeing this a second time
Apr 30 2022,negative,high expectations unmet all in all it felt manipulatively heavy and lacked any of the depth it pretended to impregnate itself with from beginning to end confusing and seemingly irrelevant infusions of the magic and the supernatural unsympathetic characters one and all depthless and lacking in any real development no matter how passionately they might wail growl like animals or say serious things too many times im aware of myself sitting in a seat in a theater with loud sounds and imagery on a screen with a single recurring thought rediculous but acting was fine and good visuals
Apr 30 2022,positive,visually a very good movie story wise a bit long winded and boring
Apr 30 2022,negative,this guy cant seem to make a good movie man i was bored
Apr 30 2022,neutral,was a little boring
Apr 30 2022,positive,what an incredible movie from the impressively long takes to the gorgeous shots of icelandic landscape to the stellar acting and to the costume design everything felt real and authentic and some parts had me on the edge of my seat what a ride this film was i almost want to see it again this may be a movie i actually buy a physical copy of which i havent done in 10 years if you love viking lore then this is the movie for you
Apr 30 2022,positive,eggers finally fulfills the promise he showed in his earlier work a gorgeous and bold epic that both feels old fashioned possibly ancient even and excitingly new
Apr 30 2022,negative,boring and dreary plot twist it was obvious from the beginning where the story was heading
Apr 30 2022,positive,pretty gruesome  however nicole kidman was her usual outstanding self
Apr 30 2022,negative,this movie wants to be a cross between 300 and game of thrones and misses wildly on both the amount of wtf is going on in a bad way moments in this movie is incredible  several people walked out of the showing i was in and i was close myself i dont understand the positive reviews
Apr 30 2022,negative,just a new version of the lion king with prettier actors it could have lasted an hour less and it was the same
Apr 30 2022,positive,a great slow story with twists and turns a story that holds you and to add great visuals
Apr 30 2022,negative,movie was terrible we spent 2 years staying out of theaters only to come back to this garbage should have got up and left after father and son scene in the cave
Apr 30 2022,positive,excellent greatest theater experience in a while cinema
Apr 30 2022,negative,i wanted to like this movie i really did visually it looked great with wonderfully detailed costumes beautiful landscapes well executed fantasy sequences and excellent cinematography i understand why the critics all loved it unfortunately thats all that was good about it the characters were all fundamentally unlikeable they all behaved appallingly none of them learned anything throughout their journeys or had any character development whatsoever and many of their decisions were fundamentally stupid why for example did everyone keep taking their armour off and running around naked to fight each other the protagonists whole driving force  is i was wronged i must avenge my father and yet he thinks nothing of murdering a bunch of women children old people and inflicting significant emotional trauma on pretty much everyone he encounters and yet thats fine because his father was murdered in front of him he was a total mary sue and i didnt care what happened to him at all also the fight scenes werent very good or realistic unforgivable in an action movie thats supposed to be realistic
Apr 30 2022,negative,still a little confused with the storyline plot twist and the ending
Apr 30 2022,positive,a compelling story soaked in buckets of blood and gore like we get it vikings were tough  but yeesh enough with the prosthetic intestines
Apr 30 2022,positive,skarsgard brings to live the viking berserker in a way that will leave you covered in goosebumps over and over     the story forces you into the mysticism of the early scandinavian religions and truly makes you understand the brutality of daily life     robert eggers brilliant cinematography keeps every shot visually spectacular and the story while not being over complicated keeps tracking you from what bloody spectacle to the next    if you dont see this in theaters youre missing out
Apr 30 2022,positive,epic movie    we need more movies like this with orignal story telling and the budget behind it to make it justice    this movie will be a staple amongst all other viking movie coming out in the future
Apr 30 2022,negative,it was crap storyline hard to stay interested or invested it was unbelievable acting was horribly directed character development was nowhere to be found maybe worth a movie night at home while checking social media or work emails
Apr 30 2022,positive,interesting morality tale  what is right and wrong  when you spend your life swearing to uphold fundamental values of your society when you you have to stop and reexamine your goals and values  when do you decide you have become that which you abhor    great acting  beautiful locales  very violent but in keeping with the story  apparently based on an ancient viking legend  more meat than the typical superhero movie but if you want something more substantial worth a  look
Apr 30 2022,positive,gritty relentless and holds no punches  off beat like an indie film with the intensity of a gothic horror    watch at your own peril
Apr 30 2022,negative,not what i thought it to be if you like last kingdom or vikings do not get excited about this movie not enough info about the characters and it fell flat
Apr 30 2022,positive,absolutely epic at times but also knows how to tell an emotional and well crafted story that stays true to viking lore and feels like a story that wouldve been told around a campfire but visualised onto the silver screen note that this movie is insanely brutal some of the most realistic and gruesome scenes put in a movie but ir doesnt use it as a crutch but rather only when necessary in short the action is phenomenal but it is not overstay its welcome this is a beautifully filmed story driven movie
Apr 30 2022,positive,one of the best movies this year style music actorseverything is just awesome in this movie
Apr 30 2022,negative,plainly horrible and forced myself to sit through 2 hours 17 minutes of mediocrity  uneven times skips and pacing for plot line  scripting if any existed were probably under harry potter   the camera angles were abysmal and choice of lighting felt like it was directed by a grade schooler  imagine trying to get the conan the barbarian and hamlet made into a smoothie added with random ingredients  thats the taste youll get while force feeding yourself for two hours  i was physically emotionally and spiritually exhausted at the end  it made even jackass forever look like a decent movie
Apr 30 2022,negative,gruesome would not recommend this movie 
Apr 30 2022,positive,really good i liked how they put in true facts on how the vikings did things watch the movie
Apr 30 2022,positive,i gotta split this review into two parts first my film and cinematography half from a film standpoint it gets a 910 for me it captures each moment with great cair while taking creative risks that more often than not pay off the directors voice really shines in this film showing off his distinct style now for my enjoyment rating this movie was pretty hard on me the amount of realistic violence was difficult for me to stomach and i didnt feel connected to the bulk of the characters now that is not a fault of the director or cast it was a really strong point from a cultural and historical standpoint just purely preference as to the kind of stories and character drives that resonate with me so i give my enjoyment of the film a 710  also some of the best female character writing i have seen in a film its often hard to depict feminine strength but this film succeeds in a way that blew me away making her power deeply feminine believable and effective
Apr 30 2022,negative,what a dumpster fire of a movie it was so bad i felt the need to sign up on rt just to warn others the rating rotten tomatoes has given it is dead wrong between the weird story that drags on the burning of children and babies and the glaring plot holes its just a mess of a movie
Apr 30 2022,positive,visually completely amazing and unabashedly in camerawork choreography and overall astetics influenced by 20th century masters like tarkovskij kurosawa fellini and others mixed with a contemporary freshness of its own the storyline and characterwork was compeling but somehow didnt spellbind me quite as i hoped for skarsgaards amleth remaining too much of an abstract sagafigure and too little the sense of a 360 degree character amazing performances from the supporting cast claes bang nicole kidman anya taylorjoy willem dafoe and ethan hawke so to me not a masterpiece like the lighthouse and the witch though still a nearmasterpiece and must see
Apr 30 2022,positive,a viking tour de force using hamlet as an inspiration but spread over a wider geographical range to give the flavor of several different social groups from norway the baltic and iceland very fun
Apr 30 2022,positive,wow epic well researched no punches pulled historically accurate viking film
Apr 30 2022,negative,sooo many visions dark witchcraft spirits and it was just awful
Apr 30 2022,negative,ridiculous from start to finish absolute dumpster fire
Apr 30 2022,positive,both brutal and beautiful
Apr 30 2022,positive,a real movie gritty grimy they dont make movies like this anymore a real sence of viking heritage and history mixed in with great violence and heartbreak valhalla awaits
Apr 30 2022,positive,raw primal brutal robert eggers excels in transporting us to that period and really gives us an unfiltered experience however the characters only become plot motivators and although compelling give the audience no real connection a quick abrupt setup could have been better told through flashbacks overall the editing could have helped it along
Apr 30 2022,positive,for a ba viking moviethis takes the cake slow at parts but the camera shots and landscape in this movie are mesmerizing the magic and folklore make it entertaining and the violence is justviolent
Apr 30 2022,positive,absolutely overthetop and fun as hell
Apr 30 2022,positive,raw intense full of passion and heart
Apr 30 2022,positive,slow start a lot of  very loud unnecessary screaching and yelling not what i thought it would be
Apr 30 2022,negative,thought this would be an okayish movie but it was difficult to sit through im being kind when i say it was beyond weird and ridiculous especially towards the end it was not enjoyable i wanted to walk out several times but stuck it out for hubby ill never get those hours back
Apr 30 2022,positive,i loved it but it wont be everyones cup of tea it is more than just hamlet set in a viking age the characters are complex trying to survive and do what they think is right in a harsh  brutal world the acting is well done and the material aspects of the movie are wonderfully historically accurate the cinematography is breath taking at points this is not an action film the fighting is brutal and realistic it is definitely an adult film with a plot set in a world of gray ethics and brutal consequences wonderfully acted and scripted
Apr 30 2022,positive,this movie is so brutal its full of enjoyment it doesnt have that typical 21 century input  the emotional connection of the characters in very impactful at the end of the movie definitely recommend watching
Apr 30 2022,negative,too long brutal scenes and a waste of money and time
Apr 30 2022,positive,the actors did an excellent job the visuals were astounding very long film though
Apr 30 2022,positive,excellent movie symbolism and story were amazing a breath of fresh air in the stagnant  cesspool of hollywood
Apr 30 2022,negative,accurate depictions of viking violence and great visuals dont make up for a shallow story and characters becoming invested in the characters is difficult to do even when trying the film goes in and out of viking theology and reality in way that tries to include both but in doing so makes both half heartedly executed much like ridley scotts rendition of exodus the theological aspect is lost with improper execution
Apr 30 2022,positive,alexander skarsgård claes bang anya taylorjoy and all the other actors of this film do deserve all the success and critical acclaim for all the hard work they put to this movie the best way to learn about history of vikings is that we watch some amazing action and history even when youre in school ive known vikings ever since i was in middle school which was 12 years of age when i learned them for my own that historical film is not only dramatic and emotional but also heartwarming too
Apr 30 2022,positive,i cant remember the last time i handed out a 5 ill be surprised if it doesnt win a ton of awards just go see it
Apr 30 2022,positive,robert eggers continues to impress and step out of his comfort zone the northman is a strange engagingly shot revenge thriller that sticks to its viking rootsfor better and worse 
Apr 30 2022,positive,a little long more character development and less guts would have been nice
Apr 30 2022,positive,a cinematic masterpiece robert eggers is an artist not to be taken lightly the northman is an action packed norse mythology drenched gritty trippy masterpiece for a time the film will advance with incredible score and cinematography brainwashing you into entering this world then suddenly like the beat of a drum the pacing will transition slow giving you a moment to breath only to advance the story before leading you back into trippy rhythmic perfection this movie is definitely not for the faint of heart if you can allow yourself enjoy the ride youll leave revising your list of greatest films the northman did in 2 hours what got couldnt in 8 seasons
Apr 30 2022,positive,games of thrones meets spartacus is how i would describe the northman excessively violent and crude with a narrow and predictable plotline eggers paints the world as the most savage of places and humans nothing more than animals despite the somewhat surprising twist towards the end the movie bored me enough to make me want to walk out
Apr 30 2022,positive,authentic beautifully crafted to the cultural sensibility
Apr 30 2022,negative,even this cast of talented actors couldnt carry this terrible script
Apr 30 2022,negative,its rare i leave a review but this movie was absolutely horrible the writing sucked the acting sucked i wanted to walk out and leave so bad the fight scenes were horrible all you see are people just falling over dead no actual action 55 of the movie is just them howling and pretending to be animals
Apr 30 2022,positive,robert eggers continues to produce must see films
Apr 30 2022,positive,a refreshing change from the garbage thats been coming out of hollywood lately im always on guard now for movies spreading the message or being woke and this movie has none of that as a matter of fact the northman wasnt even an idealized view of viking culture as it showed some of the good bad and ugly prior to christianity most european pagans had the concept of destiny that was immutable and freed them of their concern of death and this movie stayed true to that thought process the cinematography was beautiful if bleak and the acting was competent and the story was well composed one of the few movies worth watching in a theater in recent years
Apr 30 2022,negative,walked out  and im a movie fan nothing redeeming takes itself too seriously i havent cared less for a movie since the island of dr moreau
Apr 29 2022,positive,excellent acting and a lot of action great movie
Apr 29 2022,positive,this epic revenge tale of reflection and rejection for ones promise for future lineages compacted with a strong performance from our main cast and gripping action in slices of brutality the northman lives on towards tomorrow with a great beginning sluggish middle and tight ending
Apr 29 2022,negative,do not recommend literal waste of both time and money
Apr 29 2022,positive,a great movie filled with norse  viking history perfect
Apr 29 2022,positive,it is what few norseviking films manage to be a deep dramatic view of a warlike world of bleak landscapes and terrible burdens both real and self created the berserker life vision of the film is built of visuals entirely dark and depressing with much effort laid to have the big plot twist not change that background imagery or the characterizations built by it there are no scenes of lovably clowning bearded warriors with chiselled abs and well timed one liners giving scene setups in drinking halls and fighting with winged helms and beautiful polished armor this is a film without glamour or treasures or even comforts in any scene  this makes amleths dreary journey even more depressed and conflicted it is a harsh and unyielding film to view well worth the price of admission for devotees of fantasy films or horrors of war  genre but be warned this isnt a lovable afternoon viking flick for the kids its heavy and dark and not fun which is exactly what it sets out to be for better and for worse  those hoping for a heroic adventurous and fun viking movie may wish to look for something like the 13th warrior which is lesser of a film in ways but much more mainstream and may please those seeking hero story fare    this movie is a sad and terrible story of a sad and obsessed boy grown to a man living the life of his era a cruel and brutal life even when he learns truths he never knew that might change any of us were we him there is no real wonderment the dark and hopeless world image before us makes choices seem less relevant and its bleak journey a path none can escape you wont leave this film happy and that is  because you were never intended to well directed and well shot towards those ends the reduced stars i give reflect that its also dimly lit with only subtle soundtrack contribution and difficult to sit through some of the drag between story revealing scenes some choices and setups are left intentionally unexplained but it doesnt always work and is unsatisfying at times still though the visceral slow burn of its theme of building and threatening to finally get where it was always heading is addicting by the end even if its undeveloped portions leave you wanting and wondering
Apr 29 2022,positive,this was not the film i expected from the trailers it is definitely more a film than a movie very rich in mythology and the way its shot is pretty interesting but it felt a bit long if im honest well acted appropriate violence for the setting overall good but i wont say you need to rush to see this
Apr 29 2022,positive,just passed the time the trailer made it seem like it would have a better plot didnt like it really
Apr 29 2022,positive,quite a few ancient ritual scenes so be ready for a supernatural flair to this movie not what i was expecting but still an ok movie
Apr 29 2022,positive,very good period piece
Apr 29 2022,negative,casting of nicole kidman is not appropriate for the role  the actors were not successful in portraying relatable relationships very sterile      history channels series vikings and netflix series barbarians and the last kingdom are far superior
Apr 29 2022,negative,a bit slow and sometimes seemed to waiver between trying to be an almost documentary of norse customs and religious practices versus straight forward drama  interesting in places but not worth a second watch  my wife didnt like it at all and only stuck through it because we were in the theater
Apr 29 2022,positive,a visceral and visuallystunning story woven by a master in the making 55 naked swordfights
Apr 29 2022,positive,recommend it especially if you love viking or revenge tale
Apr 29 2022,negative,man i wish i could give it 0 but not an option how can a studio allow waste of money on such a horrible product very very disappointed dont fool yourself that it will get better as the movie runs just dont wast 2hrs of your life you could never get back 
Apr 29 2022,positive,robert eggers brings his a game with an epic and explosive film that brings powerful performances and a subversion of the hamlet tale that makes the story have an unrelenting pace that doesnt let you go until the credits roll
Apr 29 2022,negative,it had so much potential
Apr 29 2022,negative,the trailer was awesome the movie not so much very slow and dry i get that they were trying to show the heathen pagan side of these people but it too was very overdone in my opinion if you have an interest in this wait until it is free on a streaming service as it is not worth the price of admission in my humble opinion
Apr 29 2022,positive,the people leaving negative reviews are those who want everything romanticized or people who think films should hold your hand and explain everything barney style this film is not that   do not listen to their negative opinions just go watch it and form your own   personally i think it was a masterpiece yet i understand the rawness of it will turn some away
Apr 29 2022,negative,just a really bad movie period very loud over exaggerated music during stupid pointless parts of the movie i went in really excited hoping that i would actually see a good movie this yearleft confused and so disappointed
Apr 29 2022,negative,though the scenery was beautiful and they were seemingly speaking in an authentic language for the subject  this movie was so disjointed at times it was hard to maintain any kind of interest in the story line or the characters   i was not even moved to any type of empathy for the protagonist when he dies in the end   this movie proves the adage kill anyone but the dog  that death was the only one that caused me any type of emotional response
Apr 29 2022,positive,i will be following eggers work in the future
Apr 29 2022,positive,dragged and i think in trying to insert the vikings beliefs about their gods it just came off as weitd to me
Apr 29 2022,positive,im surprised to see this movies currently got only a 66 aidience rating   good action definite storyline some mystery  witchcraft  maybe people just dont appreciate the effort that went into the authenticity  in any case i loved it
Apr 29 2022,negative,one of the worst movies ive ever seen horrible acting dialogue mostly unintelligible nicole kidman should be ashamed she acted in this movie
Apr 29 2022,neutral,the movie which had an amazing potential to  be a great movie lacked the storyline it had a  good beginning but the end felt rushed would  have loved a bit more character development  i rated this movie like other 90 million dollar  movies for such a budget it lacked a lot
Apr 29 2022,positive,it started off as an intense and mystical movie with a lot of promise but by the end i had felt as if the movie had lost its way a classic hamlet adaption gone wrong major props to alexander skarsgard for putting on an animalistic like performance
Apr 29 2022,negative,truly one of the most ridiculously bad movies ive seen in a long time dont waste your money
Apr 29 2022,negative,its a very long time since ive been praying for a movie to end   for me there was no character development at all i did not care in the slightest what happened to any of the characters  the whole script was done in a way that had a feel of mystic speak quite difficult to follow and often rather nonsensical  the plot twist came out of the blue with no prior action or dialogue giving any base substance to justify it making it rather ridiculous and thin  its really just your standard revenge movie and not much else   a waste of my time and money
Apr 29 2022,positive,crazy dreamlike violent raw uncompromising  robert eggers continues his journey which is leading him to be one of the few quality directors in this world of politically correct and soulless blockbusters  together with aster and peele he is part of a triumvirate that is saving the horror genre after 20 years of jumpscares and reboots    the northman is a masterpiece
Apr 29 2022,negative,bad bad movie the acting was horrible  waste of time and money better off watching a viking show on netflix
Apr 29 2022,positive,if you know your norse mythology the story is easier to follow  great look into the culture of the era while weaving in some psychedelics and intense action
Apr 29 2022,positive,unexpected gem great acting great cast the way a viking film should be  a period piece i actually liked
Apr 29 2022,positive,i love movies about vikings foreign religions and mainly mid ages sword fights  it has it all and i love it but in my opinion is a little bit too long  first half i was watching with bated breath trurly it was all what i want  second half and the end of movie was too long in my opinion but i recommend it  even if you dont love folk its worth to watch even only for skarsgård and taylorjoy
Apr 29 2022,positive,a forceful violent gritty yet delicate tale with psychedelicethereal twists throughout the film manages a steady but forceful tone which ends properly in seismic fashion the cinematography was a work of art and accurately displayed the beautiful brutality of life back then from start to finish it felt like an old norse myth being retold   would highly recommend watching on the big screen
Apr 29 2022,positive,fuckn beast of a movie
Apr 29 2022,positive,a cinematic masterpiece eggers really understands myths not for the average viewer
Apr 29 2022,negative,one of the worst movies ive seen in a long time great cast but so much senseless violence dont get it

Apr 29 2022,positive,its a great movie underrated
Apr 29 2022,positive,great depiction of how it couldve been back then
Apr 29 2022,positive,no one has made film like this since the great epics of the past its truly a modern masterpiece in every way
Apr 29 2022,positive,amazing visuals with an awesome cast  will see it again soon
Apr 29 2022,positive,i really enjoyed the movie i cant rate it perfect every movie has its hiccups but this one is pretty good the clothing weapons and most of the culturemythology is pretty spot onway better than travesties like vikings as for negatives the only things that is really a negative is the idea of the herohard to use the term seriously but he is the least corrupted of the characters using a weapon with a name inscribed for cursed undead not exactly something that would be acceptable but everything else was pretty good which is a rarity nowadays in a sea of bad movies
Apr 29 2022,positive,loved the movie great viking tale
Apr 29 2022,negative,this is the worst movie ive seen in a long time  its basically 300 meets butterfly effect utterly unlikeable characters im not sure who this movie is for but it sure wasnt me or my wife
Apr 29 2022,negative,needed subtitles final scene was anticlimactic plotline was obscure the scenery was the best part could have used more of it
Apr 29 2022,negative,this movie was awfuli appreciate good camera workcinematography and when a movie is more a film but no matter how good some of the shots were it couldnt save it they tried to make a masterpiece an failed
Apr 29 2022,negative,why would big names do such a bad movie
Apr 29 2022,positive,excellent story cinematography was really good captured the darkness of the times to convey the story
Apr 29 2022,positive,not gonna lie this a sick movie pretty hilarious with some parts but these actors nailed it
Apr 29 2022,negative,this movie was very disappointing i was not entertained story line was very lame the ending was worse
Apr 29 2022,negative,overly stylized and clumsily realized scandisploitation save your money for good beer
Apr 29 2022,negative,i didnt know taking acid was a requirement to watch this movie i laughed a lot in this movie but i dont think they were going for it
Apr 29 2022,negative,hard to tell if this was a spoof an advertisement for a graphics rendering program or just a drugfueled delusional mess surprisingly terrible all around
Apr 29 2022,positive,i did not enjoy the first say 20 minutes of the film but after that it really picked up in intensity this film is like 300 but if 300 was good historically accurate quality actionplot etc
Apr 29 2022,negative,may be if it was released in the 80s might of got some attention sorry
Apr 28 2022,positive,the alnguage was hard to understand didnt like the way it ended
Apr 28 2022,positive,fantastic movie very intense and set in a very wellrealized viking world i imagine fellow metal fans might enjoy this revenge tale as much as i did
Apr 28 2022,positive,fantastic film  cinematic brutal visceral mysterious thrilling historically informed eggers is a true auteur the acting is superb the dialogue is rich and the set design is immersive  skarsgard is stellar dafoe is a master of his craft taylorjoy is perfect hawke shows great range bjork is an absolute treat and kidman rises to the challenge this is a history buffs film its a vikinglovers film its a medievalists film its a horror fans film its a cinephiles film ill be purchasing this to add to my collection to watch many more times
Apr 28 2022,positive,great movie had me on the edge of my seat the whole time
Apr 28 2022,positive,great move some of the depictions of the rituals were a little far fetched but still an awesome movie
Apr 28 2022,negative,i disliked everything about this movie we walked out less than halfway through i dont wanna waste any more time even talking about it
Apr 28 2022,negative,the story was not amazing the concept was predictable and boring overall giving it a single star seems like to much praise i dont think it was worth it and feel they could have done much more with the story
Apr 28 2022,positive,finally not a fan fiction fake viking movie a movie exploring norse mythology and creating a historically rich and accurate look at what people really looked like this movie will always be known for being closely historically accurate
Apr 28 2022,negative,very poor film cant understand the raving reviews the characters offered nothing to make you root for them things just seemed to happen but without any reason or backstory leading to complete disinterest the main character isnt likeable and basically just looks at the ground the whole time i didnt even want him to get revenge by the end loads of plotholes lame
Apr 28 2022,positive,robert eggers is simply the best director of his generation
Apr 28 2022,negative,how on earth did this movie get such good reviews terrible revenge movie the artistic approach does not work see fart and burp to kick things off boring dull actionless should have been a streaming movie
Apr 28 2022,positive,the northman is a stunning movie  i found it utterly engaging  cinematography incredible as is sound track and acting  alexander skarsgard and anya taylor joy were spectacular together  i could not look away  robert eggers is absolutely brilliant    definitely try to see on the big screen    george
Apr 28 2022,negative,im being generous  everyone in the theatre had that look of why did i just waste 2 hours of my life on that  trust me it sucks
Apr 28 2022,negative,disappointing and weird hard to understand and overall cringey
Apr 28 2022,positive,a complete package of pride vengeance lust and morality needed for a viking original
Apr 28 2022,neutral,lots of plot holes and unsatisfactory plot lines
Apr 28 2022,positive,it had some good scenes bit overall it didnt feel epic at all i never really felt connected to the story and was disappointed with the ending i would rather watch the last kingdom on netflix
Apr 28 2022,positive,fantastic movie from start to finish does drag a little during the middle portion but overall enjoyed it immensely recommend seeing on the big screen support great directors
Apr 28 2022,negative,violence  gore  rape  blood betrayal  roaring  braying  destruction  filthiness  attempted incest  human devolution  check    alist hollywood stars  check    plot  well you cant have everything can you    acting  dont hold your breath    flow  throw wild assortment of unimaginative scenes poorly drawn from other films against a wall hoping some will stick    dialogue  oh please    imagination  not evident    authenticity  how about sorceress wearing cowrie shells  cowries are native to the tropics east of africa south asia southwest pacific  nowhere near scandinavia    a train wreck suckering in the guileless who figure that top stars wouldnt appear in such a shabby soulless film  theyre famous enough that theyre just sleazing their ways to monstrous paydays    rotten tomatoes  check  a bumper crop    dazzled critics  more rotten tomatoes    boring  boring  boring
Apr 28 2022,negative,this movie is absolutely crap the characters are dry and basic if you say thats the point then you probably enjoy the smell of your own farts it is painfully too long for how simple the plot is there were only 4 people in the theater when i went and 2 people left before it ended if i had to use one word to describe this movie that word would be corny please do not watch this unless you are a movie critic who enjoys drab nonsensical works of idiocracy
Apr 28 2022,positive,authentic  gripping portrayal of life as a viking superb acting  chemistry with skaarsgard is palpable i could watch him swim  fight  thrust all day not for the faint of heart
Apr 28 2022,positive,starts out pretty dull overly focused on impossible feats of macho warmongering too much shouting and growling and not at all realistic draws you in as it goes along though but seemed very long and was extremely predictable good performances from one or two of the characters otherwise very forgettable and not very interesting
Apr 28 2022,positive,the third film from robert eggers the northman is an epic unlike any other beautifully shot with a compelling and engaging story  it definitely feels very shakespearean which makes sense given its based on the tale that inspired hamlet and i love it one of my favorite films of 2022 so far
Apr 28 2022,negative,weak ending special effects looked computer generated
Apr 28 2022,positive,finally a movie that portrayed everything accurately every background detail is pulled straight from historical accounts of the time and region i hope everyone will support this movie and send the message that this sort of faithfulness of historicity is appreciated    the story and characters are also well done i would be happy enough with a perfect unembellished portrayal of norse society slapped on a simple straightforward plot but the story of the northman is excellent as well as are the visual effects    be warned however in portraying a culture of over a thousand years ago without the usual softening for modern audiences many of the sequences can be hard to watch in the best way i believe this was intentional a sort of rough awakening to anyone who has ever said theyd like to live in a simple time absolutely worth watching and worth watching in the theater if you can
Apr 28 2022,positive,top notch cant wait to see his next one
Apr 28 2022,negative,too too many beginnings and endings without explaining how they got there  acting was excellent just too many loose ends
Apr 28 2022,negative,sorry i had to give this movie one star in order to be able to write a review  it deserves none this movie is a dog if i had been streaming it on netflix say i would have stopped it after ten minutes
Apr 28 2022,positive,this movie was brilliant a very dark story with no full on heroes its brutal and captivating with tons if mythology mixed in if youre an unintelligent person who just wants nonstop action this film is not for you many if the goofs that reviewed this film should have stayed home and splooged over ff5 for the 20th viewing for the rest of us it was amazing i truly wish hollywood would do more films like this truly stunning
Apr 28 2022,neutral,i had high expectations they were not met
Apr 28 2022,positive,i dont understand the poor reviews this movie absolutely transports you to a different time place and culture that feels alive it does an amazing job at bringing this world to life in terms of lore action relationships motivations and ritual captivating throughout and no scene felt misplaced or wasted will definitely see again
Apr 28 2022,negative,horrible movie  waste of my time and money
Apr 28 2022,positive,the trailer hyped this movie up so much overall it was a let down some good lore from time to time but overall it was a long drawn out movie it gave it that art feel but i was hoping for more epic scenes than what was provided
Apr 28 2022,negative,one of the worst movies ive ever seen  the script was a joke dont waste your time
Apr 28 2022,positive,i loved this  probably my favorite movie of the year so far  i felt like the general atmosphere of the time period was captured very well  a simple story but competent  i dont understand why people would say this movie was miscast  in my opinion every actor owned their roles and were very believable  for being a simple story i was surprised at how engaged i was with the film  i just wanted to see more of this world and culture  that said its not for everyone  if you like historical epic type movies this should be right up your alley
Apr 28 2022,positive,epic from start to finish
Apr 28 2022,positive,a very raw and brutal telling of a story i thought it was great
Apr 28 2022,negative,very poor acting was like watching a 3rd grade school play
Apr 28 2022,positive,if youre expecting a purely action packed epic then adjust your favorite expectations because theres to this film than that watch the lighthouse if you want to get a taste of what robert eggers brings to the table in terms of his art house side this film definitely more mainstream than the lighthouse but its just as good i dont wanna say too much about it but its a beautiful melding of art house and action filmmaking that floored me go see it
Apr 28 2022,negative,could have been one of the worst movies ive ever seen
Apr 28 2022,positive,intense great cinematography and story line likely realistic portrayal of life in the north in the 800s  good recounting of a classic saga
Apr 28 2022,negative,i would not call this a film only a mess
Apr 28 2022,positive,the northman depicts a brutal revenge story with stunning visuals breathtaking photography and a distressing atmosphere robert eggers otherworldly narration along with a brilliant amleth alexander skarsgård extends the shakespearean drama due to the plot being somewhat trivial the picture loses may lose its attractiveness
Apr 28 2022,positive,i liked the movie with its highs and lows
Apr 28 2022,negative,it gets half a star only because i had to give it some rating to get to write about it without doubt the worst film ive ever sat through in a cinema a simple story embellished with infantile arch cringeworthy dialogue occasionally interspersed with roaring even in a fantasy film boats should not be seen heading to shore with full sails as a cgi gale blows at right angles to them wooden structures should not appear in a treeless landscape with no obvious source for their construction as is the case with any of the other home comforts  elegant drinking glasses rich materials and blankets non existent continuity two dimensional acting as subtle as a flying blood axe alternately embarrassing and offensive first degree rubbish
Apr 28 2022,negative,hm yeah no not enough action and slow pace movie
Apr 28 2022,negative,slow and weird definitely expected way more
Apr 28 2022,positive,good bloody vengeance if youre into that sort of thing
Apr 28 2022,positive,ehh so so since when were vikings muslim its weird but somewhat entertaining
Apr 28 2022,positive,it was ok if you like gore and violence then youll love it
Apr 28 2022,negative,absolutely horrible walked out of the theatre about an hour in lots of random action scenes that dont seem to follow a plot a boring waste of time
Apr 28 2022,positive,on a technical level this film is excellent i especially enjoyed the moody lightingcolors and score fantastic details in the sets and props some interesting camera work good performances all around especially from kidman and bang it seems like the intention was to tell an archetypal revenge quest story in an almost totally straightforward way having seen eggerss last two films i was expecting a less conventional approach to this very conventional story and was thus a bit disappointed if you enjoy this setting and kind of story youll really enjoy this movie
Apr 28 2022,positive,this movie was the most accurate rendition of viking life and death it was well researched for years before they made it i really enjoyed it and the time flew by too quickly
Apr 28 2022,positive,visually a really nice movie cinematography was really good acting was above average storyplot was probably the weak point for me possibly a rewatch for me in the future 
Apr 28 2022,negative,i walked out halfway through i have never done that in my life this was one of the worst movies ive ever seen
Apr 28 2022,positive,awesome movie its like an ancient poetic epic wrapped tightly in the nuzzling embrace of robert eggers vision    just wish i could have seen it in imax
Apr 28 2022,positive,i really didnt expect so much cringe from eggers but here we are so many scenes were cringey not a bad movie overall but definitely dont go into it expecting a masterpiece like i did just expect to be entertained and you will be
Apr 28 2022,positive,couldnt understand much but holy shit that guy can swim
Apr 28 2022,negative,that was absolutely terrible the acting was really bad all around everyone speaking with a different accent making it very hard to understand what anyone was saying 30 years go by and the mother and uncle dont age a daymust be the cold at some point the main character looks much older than his mother what a waste of my time
Apr 28 2022,positive,we really looked forward to seeing this movie but disappointed in the almost nonstop violence failed to develop the characters and explain the long time before his quest for revenge was initiated we liked the depth of the symbolism
Apr 28 2022,negative,this movie is the worst i have ever watched in years it had everything to be amazing but most of the movie was about orgies black magic and a horrible story  all our friends regretted having watched it  the movie theater was silent as the movie ended  i believe that everyone was angry for the time lost to a film of such poor quality and without content  i do not recommend  very very very very bad it surprised me nicole kidman accepted to act in such a ridiculous movie
Apr 28 2022,positive,3 out of 5 stars the northman is a fair epic action historical drama film that is raw brutal and taking the story into a revenge story mixed with some supernatural nordic tone the cast did great with there performances the fight scenes are brutal and ruthless the story tried to be an epic revenge story especially the climatic volcano fight scene with two characters the direction is raw and weird with characters acting out there wild animal side with lots of yelling and barking animal sounds the man witch scenes were weird and could have been trimmed overall it was an entertaining fair film with a violent revenge journey but the direction may not be for everyone
Apr 28 2022,positive,amazing reminded me on early 2000 movies 
Apr 28 2022,negative,the actual storyline was okay but there was a lot of the movie where i think i forgot to eat magic mushrooms first to get it
Apr 28 2022,negative,the visual effects were very good the movie was not good for me as i could not understand a word of the dilog
Apr 28 2022,positive,weird movie and ending sucked
Apr 28 2022,positive,robert eggers style of dialogue may not be for everyone however this film has love blood stunning landscapes gods fate and best of all roberts magical other worldly touch my choice for best director and cinematography for 2022 so far
Apr 28 2022,neutral,very disappointedagain  it just became tiresome much of spoken dialog unclear to hear  a lot of growling  grunting  and torture and gore as norsemen will do beheading and behearting  heart eating fight scenes as believable as many cartoon superheros  i could not believe that skarsgard norse name bulked up so much almost like schwarzeneggar an interesting twist was that he voluntarily slipped in to become a slave  that was a bit incredible  and another is the perfidy of his ma nickel kidman  note to rt staff  one o my fav reviewers loved it  kyle smith behind the paywall at national review so i respectfully suggest rt include him cuz a lot of your reviewers are behind paywalls  saw it in lerton opening friday 4222022 with verifiable amc alist  giving it only 2 12 rt stars
Apr 28 2022,positive,epic story of revenge that also gives a peek into the daily lives of a vikings
Apr 28 2022,positive,best movie of 2022 so far
Apr 27 2022,positive,the movie plot was great but i was expecting epic battle scenes on the screen that was the main reason why i chose to see the movie on the big screen
Apr 27 2022,positive,not what i expected  dark slow moving just average entertainment
Apr 27 2022,negative,really a pointless movie i watched the vikings on netflix which was wonderful i was expecting something more like that
Apr 27 2022,positive,the northman is an amazing blood soaked viking epic the visuals are stunning  the story is gripping from start to finishwas on the edge of my seat the whole time the acting is fantastic everyone does an amazing job but alexander steals the show the film does a wonderful job capturing norse mythology i highly recommend checking out this viking epic in theaters
Apr 27 2022,negative,the storyline was weak and not a good ending
Apr 27 2022,positive,this movie is absolutely breathtaking to watch while having amazing cinematography gripping plot really good action scenes and a lot of understanding of the northern mythology and culture
Apr 27 2022,negative,movie was awful left a little over a hour into it
Apr 27 2022,positive,a strange but enthralling movie that isnt everyones cup of tea the performances from the likes of ethan hawke and alexander skarsgård are fantastic as is anya taylorjoy and willem dafoe for what little he is in the movie what it lacks in plot it more makes up for in visuals characters action and gore taking a story of revenge and adding in a sprinkling of norse mythology and the obsord and deviant
Apr 27 2022,positive,great movie definitely a robert eggers movie enthralling epic and sick
Apr 27 2022,positive,im speechless for what i just saw  one of the best epic fantasy movies ive ever seen in my life  robert eggers is the best filmmaker of the last decades he just made perfection in everything he do  i cant wait to see his next film  i love it is just a opera of the masterpiece itself
Apr 27 2022,negative,one of the worst movies that i have seen this year i have no clue why they play it on the flip side was very informational about odin or santa claus
Apr 27 2022,positive,it is in many ways a religious experience a cold honest and brutal look at viking culture and civilization as an outsider looking in yet at the same time enthralling and immersing the viewer into the experience of their norse faith beauty within the cold dominance glory in the bloodshed a mish mash of genres and classic stories thats part historical epic part cosmic fantasy solidifies eggers as a writer in the same way that the lighthouse solidified him as a director bold and inventive
Apr 27 2022,positive,i happen to enjoy this genre as such i found the northman a good representation of it it was very dark bloody and intense and very well acted particularly by the main lead alexander skaarsgard all of his performances from the tv series true blood to tarzan and it have proven that he can act in any role particularly the ones that require physicality which he obviously has this was probably his best role to date he had to act like a blood thirsty barbarian who not only worshipped wolves but literally became one when he was in battle that was not an easy portrayal inn that he was hunched over all of the time was fast yet light on his feet and in one scene he actually ripped open a mans throat with his teeth the same way that w wolf would this kind of acting and behavior i havent seen in any other viking movie or tv series which offered a somewhat different version of the vikings of course this movie is not for everyone especially those who are not entertained by such bloody violence but for people who do enjoy this kind of movie i highly recommend it to them
Apr 27 2022,positive,an unflinchingly brutal unrelenting and epic movie the northman expertly portrays the horrors of a cycle of violence its no straightforward revenge story and everything is multifaceted i really loved amleths characterisation as a man thoroughly controlled by his own anger and his cultures obsession with fate its a bleak setting and a bleak story but despite the savagery of viking times robert eggers still finds room for hope portraying the gentleness that can be found even in the hearts of the fiercest warriors    it was a little too drawn out for me and i kind of lost the plot for a while around 23rds of the way through but still an excellent watch
Apr 27 2022,positive,great scenery soundtrack is spot on too nicole kidmans accent went in and out the whole movie but the other leads were spot on ethan hawke did better than i thought those his time was brief definitely worth watching as a norseviking history fanbuff not as good as the show vikings or the last kingdom which slaps
Apr 27 2022,negative,i was hugely disappointed as the movie started out good then settled in to slow boring and predictable
Apr 27 2022,positive,i liked everything about the movie
Apr 27 2022,negative,netflixs last kingdom  its not  not even close  disappointing 
Apr 27 2022,negative,i am so sick and tired to my core of seeing a 3 hour movie only to exit the cinema going it looked nice but
Apr 27 2022,positive,i didnt love it but didnt hate it either very neutral movie that i might revisit down the road the witch was much better though
Apr 27 2022,negative,this is absolutely one of the worse movies i believe i have ever seen can not even began to compare to the vikings or the last kingdom viewers do not waste your money
Apr 27 2022,positive,great movie highly recommended
Apr 27 2022,neutral,much of the movie is night scene those were difficult to view a dark story line that ends as such
Apr 27 2022,positive,altho i understood it its not for everyone thought there would be more factual events vs highly imaginative pretenses of how some of nordic sagas and affairs went
Apr 27 2022,negative,i liked at the end when dr strange appears and says damn this really is doctor strange in the multiverse of madness
Apr 27 2022,positive,very good movie depicted pagan nature of northern scandinavia prior to being christianized
Apr 27 2022,neutral,too bloody  didnt show the real viking people
Apr 27 2022,negative,it was sheer nonsense
Apr 27 2022,positive,great movie with a great cast
Apr 27 2022,positive,it took me a little while to get into it but by its conclusion the northman had fully entertained me great film    first and foremost im delighted that i did indeed enjoy this film as my only previous experience of director robert eggers was the  in my opinion and apparently my opinion only  severely unsatisfying the lighthouse its unmistakable that this 2022 flick is made by the same person but happily the outcome is far greater    the cast are top notch alexander skarsgård and anya taylorjoy are the two standouts the latter of which is doing big things lately she is excellent in the most recent season of television show peaky blinders fwiw claes bang ethan hawke and nicole kidman are all very good willem dafoe too naturally    the story is super absorbing even early on when i was a tad unsure i was still very invested in what was happening onscreen the dialogue is a big reason for that as is the thumping score at times it can feel like it might become too talky and full of itself in regards to its own mythology and all that though thankfully it never strays into those realms it also delivers plenty of action alongside some good ol violence as well  the ending is quality in that regard among other reasons too    go watch
Apr 27 2022,positive,this movie has absolutely stunning visuals talented cast and amazing sound the story is simple to the point and it doesnt need to be anything but great view into norse beliefs and society be warned it is more of a drama than an action movie temper your expectations    if you liked eggers previous work you will like this too also to the people complaining about it being violent it is a viking movie that is rated r this isnt thor
Apr 27 2022,positive,my expectations going in were definitely very high but the northman ended up being basically everything i want from a bigbudget blockbuster being that it is an absolutely stunning experience visually and an intense exceptionally bloody revenge epic made by a true visionary its weird since i still havent actually watched either of robert eggers previous two features something im sure ill rectify soon but this film really did impress me on every level especially as its very clear he did not sacrifice any of his unique style in this hefty studio film its a bizarre brutally violent and extremely large movie that goes as hard as anything ive ever seen in theatres things that make it precisely why this is the type of blockbuster id love to see more of being made by big studios rather than the boring milquetoast pictures we get twenty of every year    watching the northman its clear that this is a film that has been made with a great deal of craft and effort by everyone involved admittedly the first twenty minutes or so left me a little underwhelmed and fearing that it would disappoint but everything after that was perfection on a visual level this is simply a beautiful film and there are so many shots and scenes throughout that really left me breathless thanks to the work of eggers and cinematographer jarin blaschke the action as well is sublime not only in how visceral and bloody it is but also because it is choreographed exquisitely and shot in unbroken long takes that are all the more impressive as eggers had never directed and action film before more than visually though the northman succeeds also because its story is full of emotion despite how relatively simple and straightforward it is narratively the pacing is terrific for a 136minute film as there was never a point where i wasnt fully invested or bored as its wonderfully told and written    in addition to how good the direction writing and and visuals are the other aspect that clearly deserves praise is the performances as amleth alexander skarsgård is immense and he is backed by a superb supporting cast full of great actors that play their roles amazingly nicole kidman in particular is simply superb and one scene with her late in the second act is so excellent a point in the film that really just made me decide that i loved the northman its because all of these things work so well together though that i really think its eggers that deserves the most credit this shows that he is fully capable of making a bigbudget masterpiece that represents what studio blockbuster filmmaking should be as its clear everything has been put to great use onscreen its a film thats brimming with great performances brutally violent action and breathtaking visuals that should definitely be experienced in theatres because of this or the northman is for me undoubtedly one of the best movies of the year thus far and its a viking revenge epic that leaves me itching to catch up on the rest of robert eggers work
Apr 27 2022,negative,as a period drama and movie buff i really tried hard to like this movie but i have to give it to nicole kidman her acting was utterly amazing in this movie  she made me believe and feel an optimum level of disgust with her betrayal and maternal incestuous behavior yuck  nevertheless the viking accents were off and unclear  i found myself saying what were their names again whatd she say rewind please  im american but dang im usually able to interpret viking  i needed english subtitles for this movie or an interpreter  also the cinematography didnt work for me  while the wolf pups were cute the visuals were analogous to twilight breaking dawn ii cinematography back in 2012 and the ghostly seerseior whatever spotlights were ridiculous and reminded me of wizard of oz william dafoe your acting was on point but you are so better than this disasterpiece  furthermore the battle scenes were scarce vikings battle duh  wait there were only two battles but there was plenty of blood and nose abuse  if cringeworthy was the motive i get it  lastly the final fight scene which involved two very wellbuilt potentially endowed men fighting naked was obviously missing something their endowments if you catch my drift  darn just when i thought it was getting good  to put it short despite the length of this reviewnope  pun intended and this movie looks like it will be amusing to see  the northmen was a bit too peculiar for me and i left the theater feeling downright awkward confused and frustrated
Apr 27 2022,positive,engrossing period piece  loved it
Apr 27 2022,negative,beautiful to look at but painful to watch  the howling was over the top  obviously the intention but cmon  its not the masterpiece critics are making it out to be  just watch the northman trailer and then stay home  rent the lighthouse instead
Apr 27 2022,positive,very good movie truly what i expect to see in a viking movie
Apr 27 2022,negative,too dark nothing original same story a thousand times acting horrrible
Apr 27 2022,positive,this movie was beautifully done from visuals to dialogue the audio boomed though the theater
Apr 27 2022,positive,epic and beautiful shots mixed with viciousness murder what a great combo
Apr 27 2022,positive,great sets awesome fights scenes and the right amount of weird
Apr 27 2022,negative,amazing cast great cinematography but shabby storyline almost no dialogue and a final scene of a horserider traversing the sky to valhalla no thanks
Apr 27 2022,negative,movie was horrible
Apr 27 2022,negative,the storyline did not make sense it had some good action parts  this could have been a netflix movie  i do not think it was theater worthy
Apr 27 2022,negative,my wife and i both were out of our zone for this one we stayed in for the first hour and it was hard for us to watch we left shortly after this is the first movie that i had to get up and leave in theaters
Apr 27 2022,positive,immerses you in a strange violent world where brutality and hardness of heart are virtues gets the masculine blood thumping not the typical action film as fighting is interwoven with surreal mystical elements with ties to norse mythology epic
Apr 27 2022,positive,weird from start to finish
Apr 27 2022,positive,a brutal visceral journey of revenge
Apr 27 2022,positive,we loved it for movie night would def go see again
Apr 27 2022,positive,visually a beautiful film
Apr 27 2022,positive,brilliant movie there a few reasons people might not like it   first its a mainstream movie but also a bit of an art film   second its violent but its a viking revenge film so duh shakespeares hamlet which has the same source and basic story was not a disney movie either   third its historically accurate so those who want to get their vikings from the appalling tv shows or worse may not like that vikings tv shows wellmade but historically appalling  fourth some people didnt like the mysticism for me that was the whole reason i watched it mysticism was an integral part of viking life and this film shows that unlike the vikings tv show whose mystics are well beyond appalling  see it on as big a screen as possible
Apr 27 2022,neutral,this is the kind of movie critics hope to see and actual moviegoers dread spectacular cinematography and amazing tracking shots are only of peripheral interest to the viewer seeking escapism and the story that inspired hamlet where even the protagonist tortures and maims and murders and commits acts of terror has a lot more academic appeal as the source material for shakespeare and disneys lion king than heartwarming appeal literally the only admirable character in the film is ana joy taylors version of ophelia who at least gets a better fate than the bard gave her
Apr 27 2022,negative,this was the worst movie i have ever seen  just a bunch of scenes with a stupid plot that took forever  actors were terrible as well  save your money here not worth a nickel
Apr 27 2022,positive,not what i expected too long sad storyline
Apr 27 2022,positive,a young viking prince witnesses the betrayal and slaying of his father and grows up with one goal in mind  vengeance  from director robert eggers this film is visually beautiful yet gritty and blood soaked at the same time  alexander skarsgard stars as amieth the vengeance seeking prince intense performance and great support from nicole kidman claes bang anya taylorjoy ethan hawke and willem dafoe  great flick
Apr 27 2022,positive,this new eggers movie is abstounding the two hours and twenty minutes lasted like ten minutes im prone to losing concentration and a very low attention span i literally never lost concentration i was glued to the chair from the beginning to the end alexander skarsgård anja taylorjoy willem dafoe and nicole kidman made topnotch acting in this movie the dialogues are breathtaking well thought of and have reminiscences of the best from software games this movie is better enjoyed in the theaters youll be stunned plus can we talk about eggers attention to detail and historical accuracy he just set the bar for the movie industry higher than ever
Apr 27 2022,positive,i really enjoyed the movie though it had some surrealist elements to it it was a pretty straightforward tale in a good way
Apr 27 2022,negative,terrible dialogue inconsistent time frames and story continuity shot beautifully this being one of the few saving graces that and the bevy of hot muscular warrior viking types costume sometime look as if it was taken from a contemporary scandinavian fashion company look book it was a first for me to be in a cinema where almost everyone getting up from there seats at the end of the film openly mocked the film the woman sat next to exclaimed  fantastic 5 oscars then burst out laughing so that tells you it was shite
Apr 27 2022,positive,super amazing in so many ways finally a good movie to come out after a what seems a long time loved it cant wait to buy the blu ray 5 easy 2 thumbs  
Apr 27 2022,negative,it was to hard to follow the narrative and the ending was a fumble
Apr 27 2022,positive,finally a good and unique movie in an age thats filled with 100 dumb mcu projects per year and failed reboots watch it its amazing
Apr 27 2022,positive,it was truly a great watch seeing the acting camera work action scenes and story being done in a very great way
Apr 27 2022,positive,more approachable than the lighthouse but keeps eggers stylistic flair give it a watch
Apr 27 2022,negative,we found it rather boring  they dragged it out so long by the end there was a disconnect and i didnt care he got his revenge   very meh     the only saving grace was the cinematography and audio was amazing 
Apr 27 2022,positive,i really enjoyed the movie from the acting to the attention to detail  the interesting twists and turns of the storyline
Apr 27 2022,positive,it is great action is none stop and nicole gets  stabbed with a sword 
Apr 27 2022,negative,made for hbo kind of movie
Apr 27 2022,positive,i loved it very accurate depictions of vikings from what i know great timings and fresh experience from what ive seen with this type of story
Apr 27 2022,positive,i liked the setting and it was interesting i just think there was too much blood but in weird ways like for example the horse head
Apr 27 2022,positive,first off if you cant handle highly realistic wounds and severe trauma to both humans and animals dont watch it seriously do not bring your children teenagers or elderly parents to this movie i love walking dead and zombies and i felt like i needed a sick bag after the first hour its revolting     an alternative is just listen to the soundtrack in your car if youre a viking history or skyrim fan like me this movie is pretty historically accurate and is by no means for the faint hearted terrifying ocean travel and scarcity of resources and slavery are all pretty accurate imo     spoliers     nicole kidman is an absolute perfect psychopath in this and was one of the best performances ive seen from her some moments of the film i wish i had subtitles because the accents were strong with the force dafoe was excellent as usual the seer in both the murder hut and the cave were phenomenal did we need to stab the rottweiler or behead some horses not really did we have to have a highly cgid borderline humorous volcano fight no     i wouldve preferred them fight to the death after his half brother went full chucky in the long house     the costumes and cinematography were oscar worthy did i like the movie yes i just wanna throw up a little
Apr 27 2022,positive,wowowowow amazing shots actors gave all their effort and told an amazing norse version of hamlet
Apr 27 2022,positive,amazing intense and beautiful the way everything was shot was so nice to watch in a world of cgi not for the squeamish
Apr 27 2022,positive,ignore the audience reviews this movie is unhinged entertainment and is brutal from start to finish definitely one of the better films to come out this year
Apr 27 2022,positive,the northman is a bloody at times gruesome large scale historical epic its very impressive and at times very exciting although i was left a bit cold by the actual human drama director robert eggers makes unique films and this film is no different it is also his biggest budget film an expansive vikings drama filmed in ireland the story begins in 895 ad as king aurvandill returns from battle to his island in the north atlantic he is greeted by his wife young son and brother soon disaster strikes as his brother fjolnir kills the king and claims his throne young prince amlet flees and swears revenge 20 years later amlet is now a man but his goal of revenge still burns deep eggers prides himself on accurate historical detail and this film succeeds in that it creates a world of scope and drama and bloody battles its grimy and dirty and very primal the cast is great but especially alexander skarsgard as amlet and claes bang as fjolnir but sometimes the spectacle felt a little empty i never felt truly engaged in the life and death struggles of these characters so kudos to eggers for his skill in world building but i wish the story involved me just a little bit more
Apr 27 2022,positive,let me start off by saying this is my first experience with a film directed by robert eggers the amount of audible gasps and other reactions to what was on screen was unlike almost any other film ive ever experienced the film is nonstop excitement from start to finish with notably fantastic performances from alexander skarsgård nicole kidman claes bang and anya taylorjoy their dedication to their roles was top notch this film at first felt like a typical revenge story but when told had some unique twists and turns to make it unrecognizable the film has me interested in learning more about norse mythology in order to understand key elements of the film better thats when you know its a job well done when you leave the theater and find yourself still intrigued and involved in the story a job well done from robert eggers ill definitely put higher priority on watching his other films now
Apr 27 2022,positive,the northman is an inviting entry to the world of robert eggers with a brutal visceral plot paired with psychedelic mythological imagery
Apr 27 2022,positive,you know it was aight
Apr 27 2022,positive,awesome action sequences outstanding performances and exhilarating mythology such a great movie
Apr 27 2022,positive,the movie is a beautiful experience and an absolute work of art     easily the years best     take the show vikings sprinkle in some conan the barbarian add the directorial style of the witch then top it off with something  magical and all its own    im just in awe absolute awe  all my heart
Apr 27 2022,positive,interesting film albeit a bit long very tragic film overall but i never knew the original myth about what happened so didnt know what to expect until after i read up on what it was based on absolutely gorgeous looking film with some nice scenery but turns out all the scenes that were supposed to be iceland was really irelandnorth ireland acting was good as willem dafoe and nicole kidman killed it alongside alexander skarsgrd and others kind of wished at the end when he wanted to chose the fate of kindness that they forgave instead of the bloodbath
Apr 27 2022,positive,the movie is a beautiful experience and an absolute work of art easily the years best take the show vikings sprinkle in some conan the barbarian add the directorial style of the witch then top it off with something magical and all its own im just in awe absolute awe all my heart
Apr 27 2022,positive,very violent too much mysticism but entertaining not for young ones
Apr 27 2022,positive,eggers has solidified himself as a filmmaker in this brutal beautiful and wild story its cinematography and roots in norse mythology elevate the story to new heights for eggers
Apr 27 2022,positive,the previews made it seem larger than it ended up being i cant help thinking this is story could have taken place in ragnar lothbroks universe as a larger budgeted outing with less engaging characters there were some great elements working here like the cinematography but the lead character was not able to carry the film throughout thats very important in a revenge flick there is definitely some enjoyment to be had here but i dont think this movie commands a second watch wait for streaming
Apr 27 2022,negative,the plot was messy very illogical picturization was good but other than that not worth it
Apr 27 2022,positive,this movie requires patience refreshments crunchy and cool that can occupy your mind while watching this intense viking journey brutal bloody coooolldddd
Apr 27 2022,positive,an incredible film of loss revenge and then peace and love or vengeance and ruin incrediblly eggars  threads the needle in this 2 hour norse epic with stunning visuals a masterclass in cinematography and a score that will fill you with the full spectrum of human emotion if youre a fan of historical fantasy such as troy then youll enjoy this film 5 stars all around
Apr 27 2022,negative,just overall very hard to stay interest in the plot yet there wasnt much action
Apr 27 2022,positive,very gory plenty of action and the ending was a perfect end a must seen
Apr 27 2022,positive,i like the movie overall good sounds effects good cinematography great location
Apr 27 2022,positive,although the subject of vikings has been covered exhaustively by many before the northman delivers a fresh story that engages with ferocity and magic
Apr 27 2022,negative,so bad youd have to be a major fan of this ilk im not opposed but way to poetic and artistic for my bloodshed not a single character worth caring g about and everything g is disjointed and forced so bad the ratings are obviously of fandom bias ive seen many movies of this genre the worst by far 
Apr 27 2022,positive,stunning visuals decent pacing story was predictable but still had some interesting turns    not for the faint of heart though lots of unsettling content related to conquest  everything it entails
Apr 27 2022,positive,excellent period piece it had an interesting plot solid acting and some great visual moments i would definitely recommend it to anyone who is a fan of historical dramas
Apr 27 2022,positive,great movie very shakespearean definitely worth the wait
Apr 27 2022,positive,a different sort of movie for director robert eggers but that doesnt mean it wasnt great it was epic  gripping the entire time the way the movie blended viking mythology and reality was incredibly well done
Apr 27 2022,positive,the most heavy metal film in existence if youre looking for a film thatll make you grow a beard and sixpack abs overnight this is the film for you
Apr 27 2022,negative,this was probably the worst movie i have ever seen in my life the story was poorly written most of the movie was looking at the face of the main character as he looks at whatever he is looking at
Apr 27 2022,neutral,this was a boring movie predictable plot
Apr 27 2022,positive,about as vicious and fun as you could possibly make this kind of movie eggers really flexes his skills here going all out and enhancing the vision of his weve seen from the lighthouse and the witch to new heights i dont think it really has an emotional payoff at all but its still an extremely entertaining and unique genre piece that many filmmakers could never accomplish
Apr 27 2022,positive,movie went too long keeping the main character oppressed  expected a somewhat different ending
Apr 27 2022,negative,this movie was straight trash from start to finish i understand it was loosely based on a tale from danish history but as a movie it needed a lot of editing the plot and action are frenetic and seemed more intent on displaying savagery and gore than storytelling i love viking lore and usually just about any movie about them but this one made me willing to die a shameful death missing my seat in the halls of valhalla just so i could get away from it what a wasted opportunity to make a good film do yourself a favor and just set a 20 bill on fire at home and take a nap instead
Apr 27 2022,negative,such garbage felt like a mix of rambo game of thrones and matrixmade no sense and boring as hell
Apr 27 2022,negative,beautiful to look at but drudgery to watch i was really looking forward to this project due to the hype and the talent involved but honestly i just was bored with the finished product half the time you couldnt understand what the actors were saying  most of the other time you really couldnt care less the writing for this film is really weak and the plot is thin you have top tier actors here who seem a bit lost in this dull slog of an endeavor there was one surprising scene with nicole kidman where you thought the movie was going to gain some interesting traction but alas that proved to be just a tease maybe this is a film better after a second viewing but because i couldnt wait for it to end the first goaroundthats not likely to happen
Apr 27 2022,positive,an excellent revenge movie with beautiful cinematography and historical accuracy
Apr 27 2022,positive,from the first moment to the last this movie is incredible the detail to historical accuracy enhances excellent performances in this tale of love revenge and ultimately redemption beautifully shot and powerfully acted  im afraid itll be over the head of audience members used to the syrupy pablum of superhero movies but if youre open to the experience and willing to enter this dark bloody and mystical world you will love it too
Apr 27 2022,positive,conan the barbarian meets shakespeare meets  myth sections extremely violent   i liked it i think others will not like mixture and mystical themes
Apr 27 2022,positive,it is your fate to see this movie  you can not escape it you have a choice but you will choose to see it you will fulfill the prophecy the norns have spun it there is no escaping it
Apr 27 2022,positive,i probably would have preferred the studios cut of this one this is a bit plodding but some stuff is undeniably spectacular
Apr 27 2022,positive,great story and action
Apr 27 2022,positive,traditional viking movie action scenes were intense worth the watch
Apr 27 2022,positive,intense visually enthralling icelandic mythology 
Apr 27 2022,positive,dont recommend dont waste your time watching this
Apr 27 2022,positive,an unexpected surprise  kept you wondering all the way till the end and then even after the movie was over  definitely worth seeing
Apr 27 2022,positive,a mixture of fantasy and realism although the main theme was revenge it touched on subjects of human nature that were disturbing
Apr 27 2022,negative,a total waste of time  very disappointing
Apr 27 2022,negative,very negative and slow moving kept waiting for it to get better quality reminded me of blsir witch
Apr 27 2022,positive,an interesting story of a northman though i would have wanted more viking stuff in it the story it still served its purpose
Apr 27 2022,negative,i dont believe that telling me its authentic makes it so i dont believe the norseman had kings they were a loose conglomeration of individual tribes there were leaders which were more like chiefs but not kings with one would think kingdoms herald in the second century was probably closest in uniting the tribes herold by the way pulled a puten and assumed he could just waltz into the british isles pretty much unopposed and another herold proved him wrong and the norsemen were routed and the norse herold was killed i dont think any norseman wore horns in his helmet like the guy dancing around the fire and then there was the guy with the belt loops in his trousers they kept showing us what i suspect is yggdrasil with no explanation which might have helped some viewers perhaps they needed a bit of narration but then this isnt a documentary rather a platform for uber violence the cinematography was too gray dark and murky to be memorable there were no characters that i found likable including the hero could have done with a few lighter moments all in all i think for the real fun of movie going we were better off with kirk douglas and tony curtis even with his jersey accent
Apr 27 2022,positive,a fateful quest full of bloody violence and spellbinding acting    director robert eggers viking revenge epic the nortman 2022 is truly why we go to the cinema eggers artful and engrossing direction takes you away to the era of viking raids and the aid of gods i am in awe at eggers ability to seamlessly go from brutal viking combat with guts and gore to the arthouse haunting imagery of norse mythology i really appreciate his respect for norse history with accurate god lore and viking details all throughout the northman from superstitious beliefs to sacrificial rituals to gods the only way the northman could have been more metal was if amon amarths melodic death metal were playing in the soundtrack    whether amleth is cutting off heads or chopping off limbs to getting mysterious warnings of his fate i was delighted and absorbed into the northmans bloody vengeance and mystic ways eggers can direct enchanting spells to horrific swordplay with sheer grit and gripping determination the northman is as innovative and visually striking as eggers previous films the vvitch and the lighthouse the smoky entrance to the gates of hel was fascinating just like eggers using the ancient spelling of norse words i was deeply enthralled as eggers astoundingly creative direction made the northmans massive 137 minute journey feel like half that length for me the green knight wishes it was this fast paced and exciting as the northman the northman is one of the years greatest pictures    writers sjón and robert eggers deliver a fearsome revenge narrative that is essentially hamlet and the odyssey but with vikings and spells i love the simple elegance of amleths story you always know to focus on him and how hes reacting to innocents affected by his uncles cruel enslavement of his kin to his heart understandably melting over anya taylorjoy the romance plot is endearing and gives amleth the humanity he is deprived of as hes destined for revenge of his fathers brutal murder since he was a boy i appreciate the deep mythology and viking lore in eggers world the use of norse lore to imbue amleth with a fate from odin is very interesting i kept thinking about the creation of amleths night blade sequence and the valkyrie ride to valhal among other brilliant sequences written into the northmans majestic visuals    alexander skarsgård is feral as the imposing viking prince amleth he is heroic as he slashes and stabs through enemies like he is beowulf himself skarsgård embodies a gigantic stature with ruthless fury righteous indignation and hulking physique i do not think ive ever seen a more fit actor his rippled abs are a sight to behold themselves hes certainly handsome while also portraying the most masculine protagonist in film history besides piercing you with his deep blue eyes and peerless attack choreography skarsgård is compelling as amleth with sorrowful gazes and an inner anguish you feel his pain with every look at his familial foe and each glance of romantic longing and pity for anya taylorjoys witch olga i found him a fantastic viking hero right out of folklore alexander skarsgård impressed me in melancholia and big little lies as he further staggers me with his jawdropping commitment to acting in the northman    anya taylorjoy is enchanting as the russian witch olga of the birch forest her ethereal beauty is only matched by her dramatic acting prowess you believe her pain fury concern and romance with her graceful acting anya is very subtle but you always know how olga feels which is crucial to her emotional earth witch character anya taylorjoy has real romantic chemistry with alexander as well she gives him these looks of longing and understanding that bear an internalized empathy she is marvelous in the northman her every knowing glance and look of contempt for her enslavers is palpable anya taylorjoy delivers one of the years best performances from an actress she continues to astonish and endear herself as one of the greatest actresses of her generation    nicole kidman is lovely and brilliant as queen gudrun her shocking monologue is delivered with intensity and malice with kidman in peak dramatic form she proves yet again why shes one of our greatest actresses ever claes bang is fearsome and wicked as the wretched villain fjolnir the brotherless ethan hawke is outstanding as usual as amleths father the viking king aurvandil warraven his fatherly advice and doting attitude are wise and sweet meanwhile hawke nails aurvandils brutal ways and captivating gravitas that a king must wield like a blade to ensure confidence from his people    gustav lindh is excellent as thorir the proud he plays an easy to loathe blowhard willem dafoe is funny as the zealous heimir the fool with his old speech and intense manner especially for the crowning ritual of manhood eldar skar is funny as finnr the nosestub its surprising how many laughs eggar can squeeze out of this guy olwen fouéré is eerie as the foreboding priestess ashildur hofgythja oscar novak is quite moving as young amleth as he bears witness to his fathers assassination and must row away from his life chanting his oath of vengeance ingvar e sigursson is creepy as the blunt hewitch in the cave that amleth visits    björk is fascinating as the seeress with her wispy voice and strange hand movements she was always a magical icelandic alternative heroine so its wonderful to see her again in the northman ian whyte is cool and haunting as the spectral mound dweller katie pattinson is fierce as the shield maiden while rebecca ineson is nice as halla the maiden kate dickie is mean and harsh as halldora the pict ralph inesons cameo as captain volodymyr is neat as he was an incredible lead in eggers indie horror film the vvitch his deep booming voice is as commanding as a seafaring vessels captain should be and hes got a great haircut for the northman ineta sliuzaite is captivating as the valkyria with her piercing blue eyes and platinum blonde locks    louise fords editing keeps scenes hypnotizing with a steady pace and smooth cuts from sword strike to strike with fluid coherence so you can follow all the action hit for hit to gentle cuts for conversations that keep you involved in robert eggers viking world i love the neat transitions for dream sequences and spacey visions that feel like another part of the same scene louise fords editing is starkly realistic yet dreamy and atmospheric all at once jarin blaschkes breathtaking cinematography will have long takes for combat that sweeps across a battlefield or intimate closeups for the tender expressions of love and remorse having the camera pretty much always following amleth lets us see his heros journey on his quest for revenge as his hatred brews and swells up into vicious bladed assaults on his foes many of blaschkes closeup shots will stay with me forever    producers arnon milchan mark huffam alexander skarsgård lars knudsen and robert eggers really managed to get 70 million for the northman and it looks like a 300 million movie if only more studios would trust indie directors with medium budgets and if audiences would give these artful entertaining films a chance in theaters craig lathrops production design recreates viking strongholds villages and temples with an active volcano for good measure niamh coulters set decoration features cool odin shrines and wooden and metal props for the village furnishings and weapons everything looks period accurate and meticulously detailed even amleths engraved sword is killer    robert cowper paul ghirardani hauke richter john merry archie campbellbaldwin and christine mcdonaghs art direction brings out the beauty of icelands calm grassy plains and harsh icy spaces the magical elements like the valkyrie ride and valhal opening up in the sky are as effective and stunning as odin appearing among ravens visual effects artists angela barson wendy garfinkle and reetu aggarwal provide captivating cgi for visions in eyes surging lava and a flying valkyrie ride you must not miss they do more with 70 million than most blockbusters ever could    composers sebastian gainsborough and robin carolan deliver eerie atmosphere melodies and sudden pounding drums for the northmans thrilling score i love the older swedish and icelandic folk music that thrusts into the pulse pounding main rhythms as the action ramps up into frightful hand to hand combat sound designers james boyle james harrison and steve little make every sword swinging shimmer axes clang and blood curdle as flesh is cut open by blades the gushing entrails pouring forth from gaping wounds and oozing blood seeping from stabbed holes sound squishy and grotesque i loved hearing the echoing voices for the gods and witch spellcasting    costume designers linda muir and louise cassettari craft ornate robes and layered viking armor with gilded fringes i love the blue dress on anya later on in the northman the odin traveler outfit is perfect for mythological accuracy to the valkyries armor and helmet kyra panchenkos makeup gives every man a full beard and completely new look with cute braids on all the ladies hair i can see fans recreating these looks from the northman for sure    in conclusion the northman is one the best pictures from 2022 with astonishing direction gripping performances and thrilling action robert eggers simply does not miss with three classics under his viking belt already after the vvitch the lighthouse and the northman
Apr 27 2022,positive,it kind of dragged along
Apr 26 2022,negative,not as good as it was hyped up to be story was ok  the gore and graphics were the best part otherwise it passed the time see it once to say u seen it
Apr 26 2022,neutral,i really really wanted to enjoy this film visually it was just okay story line wise it was also just okay the acting was sub par which surprises me as ive seen some of these actors in other films that ive really enjoyed there were bits and pieces of what could have been a really epic adventure however as i left the movie theater i just feltempty the ending was incredibly predictable and some of the special effects were that weird inbetween really good and really bad but not really one or the other if you wish to watch this film go on cheap night or better yet wait for it to be available on a streaming service
Apr 26 2022,positive,this movie takes itself way too seriously but well made movie 8510
Apr 26 2022,positive,loved the movie alexander is true to form nichole is a star to be sure  the story line whiles predictable still gives us plot twists and turns  and the cinematography while a little dark is extremely well done overall a really good movie to see
Apr 26 2022,negative,did michael bay direct this movie this is the pearl harbor of viking stories this might be the worst movie i have ever seen  and being scandinavian  i love viking stories and norse mythology the plot was toilet paper thin with terrible acting and nonsensical mumbled dialogue that was laugh inducing the cgi was of 1990s quality the question is how did this rate so high from the critics theres no way we saw the same movie if they truly believe this was some sort of masterpiece  more likely they were bought by the studio from the start it was ridiculous and idiotic we walked out on it with only 25 minutes remaining  we  couldnt stand to watch anymore and we didnt care how it turned out we hated every character and couldnt waste another minute watching their moronic yelling farting dog barking for another second yes i said dog barking  i have never read that vikings behaved like dogs much of the time it almost seemed like a mel brooks parody of a viking movie only it wasnt amusing throwing away 25 hours of my life and 16 did anyone involved with this film actually study the vikings  even for a few hours i highly doubt it since there was next to nothing authentic about this film it had the feel of a hurried low budget comic book film giving it half a star is far too much but it was the lowest i was allowed to give it i actually opened a rotten tomatoes account just to leave this review it was that bad of a movie and i felt it my duty to warn as many people as possible whatever you do do not see this movie even when it is free on streaming you will be angered beyond belief at the idiocy of the people who allowed this turd to be produced and at yourself for having been tricked into giving up 25 hours of your life for this dumpster fire of a film
Apr 26 2022,positive,a breathtaking visual experience with amazing musical score in pure eggers tensionbuilding style
Apr 26 2022,negative,we were disappointed from the movie trailer i was expecting a great movie experience hopefully on the order of braveheart or gladiator story line never really ingulfed our attention seemed like repeat scene situations were put in as filler content  sorry just expected a lot more from this one 
Apr 26 2022,negative,awful dark hard to see boring
Apr 26 2022,negative,it may be the most accurate viking movie ever but unlike eggers 2 other features the northman cant maintain the mood or the madness past the first act
Apr 26 2022,negative,if youre expecting this movie to be like the viking series or the last kingdom its not it was so bad
Apr 26 2022,positive,solid movie all around alot of suspense and awesome plot a great popcorn movie
Apr 26 2022,positive,great story great cinematography
Apr 26 2022,negative,must have looked at my watch 100 times when i thought it couldnt get any worse  it did
Apr 26 2022,positive,the cinematography was fantastic
Apr 26 2022,positive,dope movie love the viking age 
Apr 26 2022,negative,extremely gory  tons of crazy witchcraft  kind of overwhelming to keep up with  beautiful landscapes though
Apr 26 2022,positive,conquer your fate  so this is about a viking prince alexander skarsgård  there is one thing he desires and one thing alone vengeance  his father ethan hawke got murdered by his uncle claes bang who also captured his mother nicole kidman to boot  only more spilled blood will solve his problem  now this was well on my radar because its the new feature from criticaldarling director robert eggers  while i didnt connect so much with the lighthouse im a rather large fan of the witch so i approached this with due respect  i didnt know what exactly to expect out of the northman but im here to tell you that its a wholly memorable epic that theyve put together  the northman is a movie that goes hard and will assuredly not be for everyone  this is a story that will get violent on a dime and at the same time it is also one that is not afraid to get weird and i mean that in a creative sense  in fact that is what makes this film so standout because the story isnt all that special  its basically just viking hamlet with the levels of violence turned all the way up but the sound and cinematography make it so you experience this movie rather than watch it  i watched this in dolby which means the seats vibrate and i will say that it added an additional layer that youre not going find anywhere else  it gets psychedelically bizarre at several different points and the score is always there to loudly highlight an otherworldly phenomenon  these are vikings that you are dealing with here and it is all in a days work to watch them raid an island and enslave all the survivors  yes you are correct if you inferred that this means there is nary a likable character in sight but that is not what this story is here to do  youre solely engaged with this story to see if this man will get his revenge or not  that is what youre rooting for  alexander skarsgård gives a scarily committed performance and it is plain to see that he hit the gym hard for this role  watching him lose his mind on camera is one of the more surreal experiences you can have in a theater this year and i am well aware that we are only in april  as far as critiques go i dont have much  i did feel the length as this is well over two hours  i was never bored though and i dont think there is anything in here that should have been left on the cutting room floor  the northman is the type of movie where the audience will nervously laugh when the end credits role because they are finally given a chance to catch their breath  i dont know how many rewatches i will get out of this but for a onetime viewing i can give it a high recommendation
Apr 26 2022,positive,i did not like this as much as the vvitch but i still loved it im confused by various people saying this is a guys movie or not a date movie my wife and i two women went and saw this on a date night and we both liked it yes the story is hamlet but thats kinda the point its far close to source material than the bard was the dialogue and the action felt like reading early medieval nordic poetry it was beautiful if you like that kind of thing which i do it was also a far better use of iceland than lamb was i was dubious about sjon cowriting with eggars because of lamb but noi loved this movie its beautiful the attention to detail from socioreligious beliefs to setting and costuming right down to something obscure like the teeth of the valkyrie who did not have braces as i read later yeah okay the plot is simple but its based on composite stories and general nordic lore and history and it is stunning there were a few things that surprised me in it and the actinganyone less than alexander would never have pulled amleth off alexander gave him soul because he is capable of conveying many things with just a look i loved the castanyas best performance since the vvitch ugh just so good so pretty i cannot wait to add this to our collection
Apr 26 2022,negative,honestly it was just too wierd for my taste perhaps if i was on a drug induced high  i would have found the psychedelic scenes more entrancing
Apr 26 2022,neutral,i love viking movies however i must of looked at my watch at least four times and had a pounding headache with all the howling and drums beating i was really looking forward to this movie but was a big disappointment to me
Apr 26 2022,negative,really no stars is most appropriate horrible movie almost unbearable to sit through the first hour and ended up walking out on it what a waste horrible acting bizarre content and boring af highly recommend skipping this altogether wasted date night
Apr 26 2022,positive,not really worth the price of the popcorn and soda it is what happens when a wannabe shakespearean writer comes up with a viking revenge story and then the director decides to film in is dark colors and not get the actors to say their lines in a way you can understand the sound guy tries to hide the mumbling
Apr 26 2022,positive,this movie is excellent on every level the story characters action sequences and cinematography are really amazing its as beautiful as it is violent and intelligent
Apr 26 2022,positive,the story is a legend that has inspired so many great works of art visuals are breathtaking movies like this dont get made often but when they do they are a sight to behold and will live continue to live as legendary mythology
Apr 26 2022,negative,walked out after about a half hour  kept thinking it was going to get better but it didnt  worst movie ive seen in a long time
Apr 26 2022,negative,this film has proved to be a failure  completely waste of time
Apr 26 2022,positive,its amazing omg the cinematography is wonderful    the use of norse mitology are so refreshing
Apr 26 2022,negative,if i could give it zero stars i would  worst movie i have ever seen  nicole you must need money badly  so sad horrible
Apr 26 2022,positive,cinematography is where it really shines and obviously it has good actors unfortunately it came out to less than the sum of its parts with no clear themes or engaging narrative
Apr 26 2022,negative,horrible acting it seem too fake
Apr 26 2022,positive,very good movie overall the action sequences were phenomenal and the cinematography was beautiful i felt it was a little similar to 300 at times which is not exactly a bad thing just not as original as i was hoping
Apr 26 2022,negative,rubbish tour of inconsistent accents and continuity
Apr 26 2022,positive,look this films aesthetic is going to fly over a lot of peoples heads absolutely stunning visuals and immersion this is a film meant for the big screen the plot and character development are both very thin but this film is about the experience its an absolute success in transporting you to a different time and very different world view it does the norse culture justice without being academic nicole kidman is a distractionwillem dafoe is a bit role bummer i can honestly say this movie had me totally transfixed
Apr 26 2022,positive,brilliant movie amazing cinematography
Apr 26 2022,positive,left me absolutely speechless its dark riveting  epic
Apr 26 2022,positive,violent with just the right amount of surrealism this was a gorgeous and entertaining film
Apr 26 2022,positive,in a word this movie is intense not just in bloody action but also in interpersonal journey our main character goes on worth mentioning that while this is a gruesome revenge movie i would not consider this a war movie     i enjoyed the auteur fantastical elements to it but they will be jarring to some     i will agenge you father i will save you mother i will kill you fjolnir
Apr 26 2022,negative,one of the worst movies ive ever seen the story line should have been good but it was weak i cant believe the cast they have in this movie  should have been so good
Apr 26 2022,positive,good movie worth a watch but its nothing special
Apr 26 2022,positive,like dark soulsskyrim was directed into a movie by robert eggers 810
Apr 26 2022,negative,overly long slow plot development excessively violent terrible movie left before end
Apr 26 2022,negative,a boring and overly long version of hamlet with a rambling storyline lacking in basic story facts who what where how etc  murders and violence dragged on throughout the 2hoursplus of the movie awash in blood and mayhem with a very unsatisfying ending leaving the viewer to wonder what next with no answers in sight
Apr 26 2022,positive,the work of director robert eggers has been outstanding being the man in the north the best done the same director who brought us the witch does an incredible job bringing a story of nordic revenge
Apr 26 2022,positive,the storyline was good the cinema graphics was beautiful the actors were outstanding the vocabulary tones were extremely low and hard to hear most of the film was in darkness but i guess thats how the director wanted to visualize how vikings were in those days
Apr 26 2022,negative,this may go down as the worst movie of all time i cant believe some of big name actors that are attached to this giant heap of excrement from the incoherent throaty accented dialogue to the infantile story it just stunk the graphics department must not be above 8 years old and the writers had to be taken from some pool of pre teen gamers if you want to take some friend and go watch a really bad movie for the ridicule value this is your chance 
Apr 26 2022,negative,acting horrible  looked like a made for television movie
Apr 26 2022,negative,i was excited about seeing this movie disappointed  not into the psychedelic type of movies
Apr 26 2022,positive,good but weird visually its beautiful
Apr 26 2022,positive,this a a great film that i only need to see once in the era of green screens this movie looked and felt authentic great acting visual effects and story
Apr 26 2022,negative,very shallow plot poor character development cliche and predictable lots of violence i was bored and seriously considered walking out  waste of my time
Apr 26 2022,negative,only if you want to loose two hours from your life 
Apr 26 2022,positive,grand period piece that sweeps you in from the beginning about a young boys revenge for the killing of his king father skarsgard is excellent
Apr 26 2022,positive,this movie may not be for everyone just because this particular revenge story follows every plot thread you can think of however this does not mean that you cant enjoy every aspect of robert eggers particular style of filmmaking and specially the historical accuracy depicted in this marvelous tale its a must see for people who enjoy viking media that is not flashy but consistent and mature
Apr 26 2022,positive,the northman did not disappoint  the cast set design and costumes were all fantastic nicole kidman really embraced her character and it was refreshing to see her do a different role alexander skarsgard character played conflicted and vengeful with such focus  the engagement scenes were sometimes gory but always dedication and another glimpse into his character anya character showed a woman with strength wit and resolve their characters really complimented each other  the story line moved well provided good context and build up for the ending  they stayed true to the viking warrior spirit
Apr 26 2022,positive,visually stunning with a typical revenge story shown rather than told the visuals oh man great scenery it all will definitely will hold your attention robert eggers is definitely an original and brings much needed excitement to the movies     three stars out of four see it on the big screen the visuals
Apr 26 2022,positive,i thought the movie was excellent there were a few moments that you never saw coming and it kept the movie fresh and intriguing
Apr 26 2022,negative,boring just wait for it to come to dvd
Apr 26 2022,negative,staying true to nordic culture does not always make a good movie cliche scenes and illogical decisions by characters in the movie
Apr 26 2022,positive,eggers is just an amazing director  everything is on spot direction cinematography music actors atmosphere  and watch it in a proper theatre
Apr 26 2022,positive,i wanted to see a viking movie this movie gave me a psycho style of viking although the revenge of the movie was understood getting their was like having a drama queen as a girlfriend it was like you painted the room in no time but you also painted yourself into a corner i had high hopes for this movie but i have to agree with the audience yes some scenes were good but than dragged down by other drug induced psycho scenes that seem to happen thru the film i am not a film critic but finding this film in the dollar bin i will have to pass sorry hollyweird another fail but i do like all the top critiques give it thumbs up i wonder what movie they were watching
Apr 26 2022,positive,acting was rather disappointing too much overacting very exaggerated portrayal especially from the more established casting crew the choice of actors were very questionable as some were too established to be seen or taken seriously in the roll they took on the dialects were muddled and not always following the same flow throughout the movie would have appreciated more rugged type actors to fit the parts better for a more believable execution consistancy on pronounciation even when speaking a fauxdialect would have added credibility  graphics and imagery were beyond very well executed and nicely cut together timeline and follow through seemed to work very well    i found the movie not as captivating as i thought it would between trying to understand the mumbling it felt as if less would have been more here every scene seemed to have to be an extreme approach to really accent the savage aspect and with this not one scene really gave a lasting impression
Apr 26 2022,positive,first there was nothing i disliked about the movie it was well written and the actors brought the story to life and you can tell someone did a lots of research on the vikings in that period like songs and musical instruments clothing homes weapons and so much more the scene with the berserkers and the wolfskins also known as heathen wolves preparing for battle the battle and the afterward you saw the blood and gore and the what people lived like in huts and if you lived a rainy area all the mud animal dung human waste and finally the treatment of the villagers who was left alive either killed enslaved or burned alive  i highly recommend the movie i may go again
Apr 26 2022,positive,everything in front and behind of the camera was executed so well its very rare to see a movie thats equally entertaining as it is well made
Apr 26 2022,positive,good movie could have been great edited down to 100 minutes or so
Apr 26 2022,positive,as far as the story goes it pretty much your basic revenge story but the way its shot is just so brutal and beautiful at the same time honestly this is a masterpiece it is for sure the best movie out right now and is definitely one of the best movies ive ever seen
Apr 26 2022,positive,this film catches any average movie goers eye for the cinephile however it just does not do the trick there was a time in the film when i thought about leaving not because it was in anyway bad it was simply slow     its a classic revenge storyline with a twist in the end i loved the visuals and the continues shots that were filmed but in retrospect i was bored this is a film that i could only watch once and i am happy to say i will only watch once
Apr 26 2022,positive,movie was great the tone the setting the plot and the acting it was not like the show vikings it was its own thing and was amazing if your looking for a cuddly marvel movie this aint it
Apr 26 2022,positive,great story and superior acting
Apr 26 2022,positive,it was in incredible movie with awe inspiring music gripping action and just pure raw vikingness the only thing i would detract from it is that its particularly niche as it is actually very accurate to real history and not some flashy leather armor bound thrill that most have come to expect from viking media but that being said this is the best viking movie that i have ever seen and is up there among the top pieces of viking media ever put to screen
Apr 26 2022,positive,great movie on every level      excellent story superb cinematography believable characters historically well placed with values that accurately reflect the period and peoples portrayed strong actingactors and very good pacing     this movie cannot have an audience rating of 68  this should be near 100  the only reason the percentage is so low must be from trolls placing politically motivated scores  this is definitely an audience aimed film  what is surprising is the strong critic rating      i strongly urge all people who value good film and storytelling to watch this movie  you will not be disappointed
Apr 26 2022,positive,this was exactly what one would expect from robert eggers being handed 90 million and told to go make a viking movie and the end result was surreal immersive and offered more than a few jawdropping moments
Apr 26 2022,positive,an entertaining movie but a bit on the long side not sure it was worth movie ticket prices but it would be a good movie to sit and watch at home
Apr 26 2022,positive,the trailers were a little misleading like others i was expecting a movie with much more action that being said i was not the least bit disappointed it was a balanced mix of story action setting mystery and development it is a different kind of viking movie that i really appreciated the popular tv shows are very deceitful in their story telling eggers was able to beautifully blend reality and myth in an overall effective way i cannot wait for a special edition to drop
Apr 26 2022,negative,left after an hour worst movie ever wish i could get a refund and parts were downright uncalled for
Apr 26 2022,positive,the northman brings us an epic revenge tale with a visually stunning experience from director robert eggers to me this is the most accessible film from eggers yet and also my personal favorite every second of this film is brutal and stylish and kept me engaged the performances are great the cinematography is gorgeous and the look and feel of the movie are just awesome i think it maybe slows down just a little in some of the middle parts but most of the time i was riveted seeing this ambitious film on the big screen its one of those movies that works well as an experience but also tells a solid and fascinating story the world in this movie is realistic and brutal and a lot of it is definitely not meant to be pleasant overall it is a movie that somehow achieves artistic notes while also being a very entertaining and unique movie full of action and intensity
Apr 26 2022,positive,movie was even better than the trailer acting was superb and the visuals and sound effect were memorable first nonwoke movie ive seen with no strange moderndaypropaganda in a while highly recommend this show
Apr 26 2022,positive,although normally im a stickler for watching movies in a theater being able to turn on subtitles and take a bathroom break would have made me a happier camper with a collage of different accepts and mumbled lines i easily missed a quarter of the dialogue ultimately it was just not terribly engaging reminded me of most marvel moviesstylish lots of abs and sexy folks taking a beating but really forgettable
Apr 26 2022,positive,great film cast were brilliant and crew was on point with everything
Apr 26 2022,positive,it was very dark  i didnt fall asleep so theres that
Apr 26 2022,positive,tldr  this is the only viking movieshow that an actual viking would like        look this movie wont be for everyone     in fact there will be many who are turned off entirely from the unrelentingly honest savagery and violence that is presented understandably so the northman can be even disturbing at times     and for that i would say its fair to rate it 4 12 stars     however to me this movie is what filmmaking is about and robert eggers has cemented himself now as one of the best working directors today certainly he is the current master of atmosphereic story telling because thats really what the northman is its not just a story its an atmosphere     love it or hate it youll never forget this one     visual masterful easily the best part of the film we are talking dune level camera work set in the dark ages more than likely going to take home the oscar for best cinematrophy next year     music awesome especially presented alongside the visuals again very similar to dune though the northmans soundtrack might now work as well on it own if you were to just listen to it in that regard not like dune     dialogue this one is contentious as there certainly will be people who hate the dialogue because it is presented as more poetry as opposed to more traditional exposition in hollywood historical epics think shakespeare especially considering that this is the story that inspired hamlet in the context of being a nordic saga to me however i was impressed by sjon  robert eggers work here the dialogue never felt like it was trying to hard or cringy instead it did indeed feel and sound like we were listening to a nordic saga     story the story is simple and quite honestly youve seen or heard this story before again hamlet the lion king thats fine however because this movie is not really about the story as we typically or rather traditionally think of it instead robert eggers though to try a new way of story telling one that feels so much more visceral like you can feel it on your skin afterward the story of the northman is an ordeal to watch though its an ordeal that will challenge and possible reconfigure your idea of how stories can be told for that i most certainly hold it in high regard     to me the northman is now the first and foremost viking story to ever be presented on the big or little screen     4 12 outta 5 stars
Apr 26 2022,negative,being a fan of most all viking series and films i was excited to watch this movie which features several acclaimed actors it was a flop from start to finish hard to follow dialogue poor acting weak storyline and boring i was itching to leave the theater as this was just plain embarrassing bad movie and a complete waste of time
Apr 26 2022,positive,beautiful brutal and epic instant classic
Apr 26 2022,positive,great movie well paced and very accurate  if you dont understand the basics of norse mythology though it can be quite confusing at times luckily i knew enough to enjoy the film 
Apr 26 2022,negative,it was terrible it could have been done in 30 minutes saw one girl up close with braces dont waste your money hard to follow everything going on
Apr 26 2022,negative,dont waste your money
Apr 26 2022,positive,nothing new to offer in the story department but was beautifully crafted and acting was top 
Apr 26 2022,positive,excellent original and exciting 
Apr 26 2022,positive,wow robert eggers is an absolute force a virtuoso his attention to detail coupled with his passion for authentic story telling is a thing of beauty this movie is extraordinary in every sense of the word the performances put in by everyone were solid and brought such life to the story a relentlessly dark and gritty film that should be enjoyed in theaters
Apr 26 2022,negative,i did not like this movie the cgi was bad blurry t the movie was a flop
Apr 26 2022,negative,wth did i just watch and wasted 25hrs of my life
Apr 26 2022,neutral,this is a guys flick not a date night flick  i liked it but not my date
Apr 26 2022,positive,shot masterfully and directed well the trailer sells it as more of a action revenge film when it is not i saw a different movie than i thought
Apr 26 2022,neutral,weird but kinda slow and disjointed
Apr 26 2022,negative,this movie preview looked like a man action movie it was not at all it seemed more like a shakespearian tragedy great actors in it with little to do but grunt and wail this is probably the worst movie i have seen in a decade save your money and time
Apr 26 2022,negative,this movie seemed to try too hard  to be epic  it didnt work for me  the drama  action didnt seem credible nor very interesting  just melodrama gore and pointless soliloquies  boring
Apr 25 2022,positive,great movie this movie took me out of the present and thrust me into the savage past a lot of great visuals and action top notch acting
Apr 25 2022,positive,the most heavy metal movie ive seen since fury road if you think this is a typical revenge tale like hamlet or gladiatorjust wait theres a twist about halfway through that changes everything
Apr 25 2022,negative,acting was very good but the story was disjointed and boring  not impressive  excited for an epic viking era moving but this definitely was not it
Apr 25 2022,negative,slow really slow and not much action at all strange story
Apr 25 2022,negative,confusing the dialog was hard to understand yeah sorry man didnt like it very much
Apr 25 2022,positive,awesome movie its spectacular and brutal but its not an action movie like many may have expected there are moments of great violence and savagery but there are a lot of character moments and atmospheric mythical sequences that are like dreams or hallucinations given that the original nordic myth is the inspiration for hamlet i can say it is very much like watching a shakespearean play the visuals are stunning  
Apr 25 2022,positive,the only movie in the past 10 years that ive given a rating this is a masterpiece
Apr 25 2022,neutral,im probably biased by my interest in new england folklore but this was my least favorite of eggers features films i understand his desire to integrate some mysticism especially considering the source material is hamlet but some of those scenes felt corny and poorly executed
Apr 25 2022,positive,a trippy mushroomlike viking adventure movie beautiful cinematography stunning visuals dafoe and bjork have excellent small roles
Apr 25 2022,positive,always like alexander skaarsgard his father as well but this movie was not his best too dark and a bit too fantastical
Apr 25 2022,positive,the audience reviews for this film are absolutely hilarious so many normies saying so boring i walked out an hour in its sad that they cant appreciate legitimate art this is a robert eggers film but the marketing has to appeal to those who dont usually use their brain while watching something so i understand the mixed reception this is not a remake or a sequel although its main plot is similar to a few popular works of art it is full of unique visuals characters and twist that keep this film captivating if you arent looking for a bloody  dark epic that has a lot of balls go watch sonic 2 instead
Apr 25 2022,positive,best movie ive ever see odn is with us
Apr 25 2022,positive,i never write reviews but i just walked out of this and felt the need to do so i was not a fan at all of robert eggerss previous two films they were too out there for me but as a fan of any revenge plot it simply does not get any better than this some of the weird psychological stuff is still there but it blends nicely with the overall tone if you are like me and were turned off by his previous films give this one a chance it is epic brutal and perfect
Apr 25 2022,negative,save your money and your time the few big name actors have minimal screen time i kept thinking geez how much longer will this movie last
Apr 25 2022,positive,this film has exceeded all of my already high expectations  robert eggers has in my mind cemented himself as one of the greatest filmmakers of our time  i get emotional thinking about this film not just for the experience of watching it or reflecting on its themes but also in the knowledge that i have witnessed something that i may never see matched within my lifetime  luckily robert eggers is young and has a lot of life yet to continue creating such tremendous works of art
Apr 25 2022,positive,for anybody expecting a thor film with samuel l jackson showing up on a space ship at the end winking at the camera am really sorry this film disappointed you
Apr 25 2022,negative,worst movies i have watched in a very long time we left the movie theater in the first hour we couldnt stay any longer waste of money
Apr 25 2022,negative,long boring flat no taste and  as an audience i had zero     emotional attachment or any feeling to whoever was moving on the screen
Apr 25 2022,negative,terrible movie had no plot violence was disturbing and over the top unnecessary left after the 1st hour
Apr 25 2022,positive,alexander skarsgård unhinges his jaw and swallows this thing whole like a python choking down a gazelle carcass berserker mode king shit
Apr 25 2022,positive,i think this film is a perfect marriage between arthouse and mainstream films robert eggers artistic style is strict historical accuracy mixed with visual jungian spirituality  if youve seen the witch and the lighthouse you would know what i mean long oneshot scenes beautiful set designs and great performances are all aspects of this film its not a film for everyone but i think it will be as time goes on i recommend
Apr 25 2022,negative,this movie was slow and the acting was to be desired zero suspense a typical revenge plot without holding a candle to braveheart gladiator or even the show vikings if this had been streaming i would of turned it off 20 minutes in
Apr 25 2022,neutral,wasnt what i thought it would be  this wasnt worth them money
Apr 25 2022,negative,if i could give it 0 i would i couldnt handle the awful accents that kept changing throughout the film the film itself was awful the story was not captivating i was bored and should of walked out the screening
Apr 25 2022,negative,horrible best part was when it was finally over
Apr 25 2022,positive,not for the faint of heart  unapologetically brutal just like history
Apr 25 2022,positive,fantastic  very authentic beautiful landscape great acting
Apr 25 2022,negative,truly awful movie  no character development  nothing redemptive in the least bit about the movie  its like they decided to just have a lot of blood and screaming and nicole kidman and muscle be a movie  i would have walked out with the other folks that did if it werent for my daughter having bought the tickets  i was a huge fan of vikings and last kingdom and this was so far in every regard from those epic adventures  if i could give it a zero i would
Apr 25 2022,positive,although i havent seen robert eggers debut film the witch i did see his 2019 follow up the lighthouse and seeing how i thought that was one of the best films of 2019 i was very much looking forward to this more mainstream third film that he promised and although i wouldnt call the northman mainstream i would still call it awesome  i dont think the film is so mainstream that almost anyone can enjoy it and i myself did have my issues with the romance in the film however i still very much enjoyed the film  the acting was great the visuals were stunning the action was awesome the score was beautiful and the tone made this simple story feel like the epic myth that it wants to carry itself as  although i could see some being turned off by it much like eggers other works i myself was always invested and walked out loving it
Apr 25 2022,negative,very dark not only in plot but filming  i love the viking cilture but this was too much  more about witchcraft  i left early and didnt even care how it ended
Apr 25 2022,negative,this passed the time but i kept checking it the most notable part of this movie was its actors this movie had potential there were quite a few captivating scenes but there werent enough of them to counteract the dull unimaginative ones this movie felt halfhearted and occasionally labor intensive on the viewers part
Apr 25 2022,positive,the tale that inspired hamlet and the lion king
Apr 25 2022,positive,mythology and culture was very well represented   i was expecting more range in alexander skarsgards performance maybe a stronger plot the one love scene was disappointing given his lustiness in true blood and big little lies
Apr 25 2022,negative,this movie was like watching a poorly rehearsed stage show the acting was weak at best and the story line was lacking any real body or depth it was boring and painfully predictable if you want a decent northman story watch vikings instead
Apr 25 2022,positive,totally bad makes you want to chug a monster and punch a deer in the face
Apr 25 2022,negative,literally the only movie i ever wanted my money back for let alone the 2 hours of my life 
Apr 25 2022,positive,lots of dancing around the fire fantastic acting and story and you will not be sorry 
Apr 25 2022,negative,wtf this is a movie that doesnt match the trailers in any way bait and switch terrible waste of money wouldnt watch it for free
Apr 25 2022,negative,i had such high hopes for this film after seeing the previews and knowing how many high caliber actors are in it  all i can say is do not spend your money to see this movie  it was absolutely horrible  in a nutshell they took a decent sounding premise and turned it into a mess of a high budget indie film
Apr 25 2022,positive,i really believe half of these people didnt actually see the movie and are just criticizing to just criticize this movie will take you on a journey though emotion and trauma the revenge story that will be popular for awhile until another blooms not only do the actors truly put themselves into these characters the atmosphere the setting and not to mention the weapons they use seem so accurate to the time they are representing i will be definitely buying to own this kind of movie as it does scream badass
Apr 25 2022,negative,really a dark dull boring and horrible movie  couldnt wait for it to end  kept sticking around hoping for some redeeming value but it never cameand i really like viking movies
Apr 25 2022,positive,9910    after just one viewing of robert eggers first two films the witch and the lighthouse my initial scores were not nearly this high but this definitely feels like a more straightforward story i will admit some things definitely confused me in the movie but they werent necessarily necessary things to understand at the time and eventually things happen later in the movie that clear up any confusion the valkyrie scene at the end was dope and visually stunning and was one of many visually stunning shots laced throughout the film i absolutely think its safe to say after three films this is eggers best looking and all the technical aspects of the movie are near perfect the story is not as complicated as the lighthouse or the witch but robert eggers is absolutely a name anyone who follows and respects good films will know if they dont already after this movie
Apr 25 2022,positive,its a work of art eggers continues to impress me with his love of history and fine detail very atmospheric incredible soundtrack and sound for that matter beautifully acted its a shame its getting a bad rap because its long or boring these people dont seem to understand the concept of these types of movies yeah its not for you but no reason to write a bad review because it was long etc a movies length doesnt instantly make it bad per se its a ridiculous way of reviewing basically ruins it for the people that do appreciate this type of film making so ill end with this definitely not for everybody if your attention span is less than a gold fish and youre a marvel disney in that vein etc fan then you will hate this dont bother seeing it however if you love the art of film making and quite frankly a damn good story i highly recommend
Apr 25 2022,positive,a bold brutal norse story of revenge
Apr 25 2022,positive,this movie was amazing  excellent story the story kept on moving along with different twist shot beautifully and music very eerie works excellent with the movie movie is brilliant  
Apr 25 2022,negative,im an avid  vikings fan of the tv series this movie is a disservice to anyone genuinely interested in vikings culture instead its an all to familiar example of hollywood making a bloated overblown and definitely overhyped cartoon using famous actors all who have done much better work in serious movies or tv
Apr 25 2022,positive,plot is a bit linear and padded i wish the reality and surreal line were blurred a little more
Apr 25 2022,positive,beautifully shot with the perfect balance of action and intrigue the northman is a masterpiece of historical drama with a good sampling of mysticism and folklore the attention to historic detail and mythology is a welcome change from the industry norm of good enough run with it common to most modern films eggert and crew should be proud of this one as i believe it will stand the test of time just like the icelandic sagas that were its inspiration
Apr 25 2022,positive,what an amazing movie about masculine men and wonderful beautiful women doing what we know is our true nature loved it
Apr 25 2022,positive,the most iconic 2022 movie ever love it
Apr 25 2022,positive,eggars is one of my favorite filmmakers and this film is the best viking depiction i have ever seen on screen as usual his painstaking attention to detail and historical accuracy does not go unnoticed ive read many norse sagas including the tale this film is based on which inspired shakespeares hamlet and its faithful to the old norse mythology the original tale of revenge the actors truly committed to this story and braved insane conditions to make it i hope studios keep giving money to directors like eggars who craft unique beautiful films
Apr 25 2022,positive,having only recently been introduced to robert eggers and his unique worlds shaped by his directorial experience with willem defoe and anya taylorjoy i came into this movie intrigued by both concept and execution the northman a twisted revenge story based on icelandic sagas is an adrenaline pumping testosterone fuelling experience that brings out audiences primal instincts alexander skarsgards outstanding savageryfilled performance as amleth in a journey across ancient lands to avenge death by the hands of claes bangs feng is brought to life with stunning visuals only achieved by eggers rigorous historical standard alongside an eerie nordic soundtrack that captures watchers the northman is one of the better movies i have seen
Apr 25 2022,negative,badly acted with silly dialogue and so far fetched that we burst out laughing at times contemplated leaving and was glad when it was finally over
Apr 25 2022,positive,overall i really enjoyed this film  the trailer is misleading primarily because it makes you think that its supposed to be action packed revenge epic  its slow burn revenge movie and when it does hit a fight scene there is a lot of blood  the movie was well acted  directed  it was a bit trippy at points because of the heavy leaning norse religionmythology  personally i would have liked more action but given the story  how well done it was i walked away satisfied
Apr 25 2022,positive,an epic tale about the endeavors of pursuing what one believes to be their destiny the northman presents themes of masculinity and fate in a ceaselessly entertaining and visually gorgeous film stunning vistas fantastic supernatural encounters and of course artistically choreographed combat are all punctuated by the humor of men grunting at each other for lack of a better language with which to emote if you can stand the gore this movie is all around enjoyable and is most memorable as a series of vivid canvases that eggers meticulously crafted
Apr 25 2022,negative,horrible and the acting was awful  i felt no connection to the characters and wanted them all to perish in the end
Apr 25 2022,negative,too long of a movie  and too much mystical scifi for the last  approx 45 mins of the movie  we were just about read top get up and leave because we just didnt even really care how it ended
Apr 25 2022,positive,the whole plot was not anything like a viking movie should be like
Apr 25 2022,positive,some scenes if intensity  sure fine  relentless intensity however  a bit much  regardless the movie is well made and gripping
Apr 25 2022,negative,disappointed long boring movie
Apr 25 2022,positive,the northman is a 25 hour shamanic ritual that treated people of another time and civilization aspeople of another time and civilization robert eggers is the directorial antidote to history by ridley scott incredible authenticity a true recreation of the viking sagas and plot about masculinity vengeance and the costs therein really really boldwill audiences get it lets hope
Apr 25 2022,negative,good screenplay but booring as hell
Apr 25 2022,positive,it was not what i expected it was to dark 
Apr 25 2022,positive,visually stunning with sharp dialogue an interesting story 
Apr 25 2022,negative,i think i must have been watching a different movie from others as im afraid to say i found it awful so much so that i walked out after an hour i cant think of anything positive to say for the hour i watched sorry
Apr 25 2022,positive,amazing film a feast for the senses
Apr 25 2022,positive,a shakespearean take on a nordic revenge story that is unforgiving in its brutality and testosterone filled bloodshed often hard to watch but you cannot take your eyes off it for a second a truly dark gritty raw and breathtaking cinematic experience
Apr 25 2022,negative,one of the worst acted movies ive seen in a while and the adaption of the story was comical it could have been epic but it was a flop dont waste your money
Apr 25 2022,positive,cool viking shit whats not to like
Apr 25 2022,positive,i have never seen any of robert eggers other movies but i have heard they are really good when i saw the trailer for this movie i knew this movie had to be seen in theaters and i am glad that i did this movie is the definition of a theater experience the cinematography and coordination of the fight scenes are done so well the final battle was one of the most epic final acts i have ever seen even though it is slower paced and very weird sometimes i absolutely recommend this movie
Apr 25 2022,negative,it was nothing that i thought it would be was very dissatisfied
Apr 25 2022,positive,the ending was a little predictable but the movie was still phenomenal  its a visual delight with great acting  cant wait to watch it again
Apr 25 2022,positive,great movie loved the brutal fight scenes but some scenes were quite the surprise nevertheless this movie had its holes and slow ascension but the journey it exhibited was fabulous
Apr 25 2022,negative,very disappointed  story line was hard to follow  and got very boring  one of the worst viking movies ive seen
Apr 25 2022,positive,simple story with good traditional storytelling and a heroes journey overall this is a rare treat for a movie with good storytelling and very well executed some of the mythological elements are a bit cheesy in how they are presented but they are few and far between story is great characters are great music is great visuals are great the only really disappointing part was the bit of plot armor that had to be introduced for the sake of the main female character
Apr 25 2022,negative,total stone dead silence as the audience painfully considered what sort of gargantuan mess of botch job movie had just taken place  but there was relief at least that the screaming was over  the paid bots are out to write this one up along with the career nervous official critics it is a text book reference on how not to direct a movie   not the slightest sensitivity to storytelling torturous pacing cardboard characters lethargic action predictable outcomes repetitive utterly unconvincing   interlaced with cringy esoteric cutaways yea sure vikings were just another native american tribe merrily engaged in a routine jabbering knees up around a campfire  the key directorial flourish have everyone shout as loud as they can for as long as they canthat will distract the audience from the woeful weaknesses elsewhere   it didnt  nor did the overplayed yawn of the prolonged pathetic violence  i was never so glad to breathe the cool night air though with chagrinhaving had nearly 3 hours of my time antagonisingly wasted i
Apr 25 2022,positive,brutal and masculine  immersive and atmospheric  an actiondrama movie with horror elements  historically accurate so tired of seeing movies about ancient greeks romans and vikings speaking with british accents  no british accents in this movie      a little light on character development  but honestly the arc the main character goes through is only slightly more simple than simba in the lion king  the main difference between them is that simba thought he was responsible for killing his dad and pillaged a bit less than amleth
Apr 25 2022,negative,lousy movie a story about reckless revenge with hallucinations perhaps the product of eating raw meat more blood and scenes of violence than in carnage which do not contribute anything to the plot and where the only conclusion that the viewer can draw is that if you are going to have twins you should jump into the sea and leave your wife for 21 days in a boat alone with 5 men
Apr 25 2022,negative,a waste of time and money an odd mix of the human affinity for the power of wild animals in an oddly old western take on native people no redeeming qualities considering the big name actors involved
Apr 25 2022,positive,this was easily the best movie to come out this year the fact that audiences on here rated morbius higher should tell you everything thing u need to know about other reviewers opinions marvel could literally film the hulk taking a dump and the sheep on here would give it 5 stars if youre a fan norse culture or mythology its a must watch 
Apr 25 2022,positive,the trailer gives you an idea of what the movie is about but doesnt spoil the plot of the film  the film is well shot well acted and well written
Apr 25 2022,negative,not what i expected at all no tsure what the idea was here started out as barbarian raiders then seemed to swirh gears and the hero becomes a slave to get close t his fathers killer but somewhere in this mess it seemed to become mythicalwhy
Apr 25 2022,negative,my wife and i left after 40 minutes this movie was dark and had no character development or meaningful plot its been compared to gladiator it is very far from gladiator no redeeming value
Apr 25 2022,positive,this was an epic movie really liked this movie the scenery was beautiful the director did a great job on filming it
Apr 25 2022,positive,great watch the film had me entertained the entire time the way this was filmed seemed almost like an indie lowbudget film but with great visuals and effects i feel as though many scenes seemed almost rushed through and some scenes didnt seem as important to be included but non the less this was a great watch highly recommend
Apr 25 2022,positive,a compelling movie with a strong story and dark tones but could have done without some of the theatrics like a merge between the lighthouse and the vitch would recommend it but would have been better with less masculine testosterone
Apr 25 2022,positive,when a young viking prince watches his father die at the hand of his uncle he begins a quest to avenge his father and retake his kingdom    i loved this film it is right up my alley as it is dark violent action packed and perfectly crafted     robert eggers does an amazing job of bringing you into this world and making you become entrapped by it the mixture of cinematography and music make for an extremely immersive experience    the cast is across the board perfect alexander skarsgård gives one of his best performances along with anya taylor joy nicole kidman and claes bang each character is fleshed out and adds an important element to the film     i am not a history buff so i cant comment on the accuracy of the vikings or the norse mythology involved what i do know is it was extremely enjoyable to see how these people acted and the rituals they perform i saw this film with some friends who for the most part prefer comic book and comedy films they found certain aspects of this film over the top and strange i did not at all feel that i thought it was cool and interesting to see this culture    the storytelling is great and has some what of a slow burn feel to it but that is one of my gripes certain scenes i felt didnt really have that much significance and probably couldve been cut that being said it doesnt take too much away from how great the storytelling is    this is not a film everyone will enjoy if youre someone who only enjoys comedys and action films steer clear if you are someone that loves diving into characters and becoming invested in a new world you should definitely check this film out    910
Apr 25 2022,negative,this would have been a mediocre netflix movie  not something i wanted to pay to see in the theater  slow poor plot development and not the greatest acting
Apr 25 2022,negative,i am a robert eggers fan  the lighthouse is one of my favorite movies but i was not crazy about this one  there is plenty to look including some really well shot scenes but it was missing my favorite part of his previous movies great dialogue and characters  this felt like it was a historical super hero movie     they never delve too deep into any of the characters and they come off so one dimensional  his previous movies felt like taking a time machine and hanging out with some real people from the past but i never felt like any of the characters from this movie were real and the dialogue only contained what was necessary to advance the plot or some random viking rituals  the mythological elements in this movie were pretty neat i guess but didnt really fit into the movie in a coherent way
Apr 25 2022,positive,one of the best movies of the year
Apr 25 2022,positive,the movie was way too long it started around at night 1007pm showing i dont get out of the theater until 1250am like the plot twist at the end and understanding of the celtic culture back then the story had  questioning  parts where it felt disturbing but the action was good though
Apr 25 2022,positive,love the movie it was an awesome experience hopefully they have the next be even better just as good as the books
Apr 25 2022,negative,this movie had the potential to include an all time fart noise and failed naked dudes and odd chants made this film great though tbh 
Apr 25 2022,positive,fantastic storyline is insane
Apr 25 2022,positive,entertaining as hell great visuals
Apr 25 2022,negative,sad vikings sure they had a group or army thing going on
Apr 25 2022,positive,it was a slow burn that kept growing more intense as the film progressed the struggles and triumphs were as epic as the cinematography and the story did not disappoint
Apr 25 2022,positive,this movie was awesome please dont compare it to 300 or troy if you do your missing the point they wanted to make this as real as possible and they did just that with the real history and language of the northman culture yes there are slow parts in the movie but the story and dialog is amazing as well as the cinematography when it comes to the landscape when you go to a movie watch it as thats the only movie you have seen and stop comparing it to others just sit back and watch perfection at work not to mention the casting was insane
Apr 25 2022,neutral,its hard to compete with shows like netflixs the last kingdom but it was something to do on a saturday night would i see it again no but if youre really into viking stuff it might be worth checking out
Apr 25 2022,negative,movie was not that great
Apr 25 2022,positive,i was really excited to see this movie overall i guve it a 67 out of 10 a bit slow in areas but the acti g was very well done
Apr 25 2022,positive,the northman is entertaining and beautiful but the ultimately the movies message about violence begets violence could not transcend the films gratuitous violence and it makes the northman somewhat hollow
Apr 25 2022,negative,i love robert eggers hes made two very impressive movies with the vvitch and the lighthouse so the only reason i went to go see a vikings movie was because he made it im not a fan of viking stories so this review may be biased but this wasnt very good some scenes were really intense which made for an interesting watch alexander skarsgard and anya taylorjoy were the best part of the entire movie some of the arthouse technique approaches did not feel necessary to the story as they did in eggers previous films
Apr 25 2022,positive,it was a non stop adrenaline viking filled movie great acting great story a must see
Apr 25 2022,positive,incredible visuals with masterful music made for a great cinema experience
Apr 25 2022,neutral,this film had great potential however some parts did not make sense which caused the storyline to be a little confusing for some the first 30 minutes are action packed and feature some interesting fight scenes however shorty after you are met with 4060 minutes of nothingness the film also features a bizarre hallucination of a sword fight with a skeleton i personally believe that it would have made more sense to keep this as a real scenario rather than fiction regardless this film is worth a watch for those who do not get bored easily
Apr 25 2022,negative,great fight scenes but the the movie was slow and not very enjoyable
Apr 25 2022,positive,amazing story telling  incredibly intense as usual great acting and settings but with some great action thrown in this time as well
Apr 25 2022,negative,the storyline was okay it was the in between that was weird for me like the part where the king and his son acted like dogs and just some parts were just disturbing
Apr 25 2022,positive,literally the hamletlion king story in viking skin good fights and visuals acting is pretty stiff from the side characters nothing spectacular but nothing bad
Apr 25 2022,negative,good storyline not enough action had so much potential
Apr 25 2022,negative,the movie was very slow and too artsy it had brutal deaths but they were few among the many weird rituals also many plots made zero sense like skarsgard is part of a group that takes a guarded city in 3 sec but he leaves them to be a slave to his uncle to get his revenge instead of attacking with his new clan or when uncle leaves him at home to instead fight at a volcano instead of facing him at the home
Apr 25 2022,negative,it was the worst movie i have seen in a long time the story line was slow and predictably and not very interesting i left before it was over and i never do that
Apr 25 2022,positive,very rarely there comes a movie that is so good you gladly pay to see it one more time this is one of those movies great story tremendous acting and absolutely beautifully shot and what a soundtrack not to mention its a rarely seen historically accurate depiction of european history     masterpiece
Apr 25 2022,negative,maybe i went in with the wrong expectations from the reviews i expected great combat scenes a basic storyline and some half decent gore instead what you get is maybe 2 or 3 proper fights which are really underwhelming since they only feature a couple of people an over done storyline and some glimpses of gore when the film finished the entire audience was simply quiet there was none of the usual hubbub of discussion you couldve heard a pin drop everyone was pretty much amazed by the mess of a film theyd just seen really dont understand the positive reviews its a 510 film at best i get that the director was trying to put in a bit of icelandic history but it couldve been done in a much better way i guarantee even the positive reviewers will never rewatch this as its completely forgettable
Apr 25 2022,negative,besides the good cgi  fight scenes pretty drawn out  boring id recommend to stream last kingdom on netflix  save 20
Apr 25 2022,positive,robert eggers is definitely a filmmaker with talent and ambition the witch were both great movies the latter especially and showcased his incredible eye for visuals and penchant for slow burning horror and tension hes clearly adept at depicting a gradual descent into madness and thats on full display in the northman an epic tale of blood brutality and revenge where the louder a person shouts the more powerful they seemingly become alex skarsgard is a commanding presence in the lead role a hulking mass of sinew on a quest for vengeance when you break it down the story is nothing special somebody loses a loved one they set out to kill the person responsible its been done countless times but the time the film takes the atmosphere it develops and just how long it makes you anticipate the payoff makes it something truly special i felt that some scenes did go on too long and there are stretches where our hero is essentially handed pieces of the puzzle by spirits or soothsayers or enchanters who tell him exactly what he needs to do next like somebody is reading him the stage directions theres a lot about the film that is inherently silly like men growling at each other and howling at the moon as well as our hero hacking parts of his own hair off with a dirty knife then appearing in the next scene like hes just walked out of a salon also i was confused by lines such as ill see you at the gates of hell where you will die surely if youve reached the gates of hell youre already dead right these issues aside the northman is a bold and brutal epic that deserves to be seen on the big screen eggers continues to hone and evolve his cinematic craft and we can only imagine what hell come up with next
Apr 25 2022,neutral,so at least this movie is mostly pretty a surprisingly meh overacted film that seems to come from someone whos whole frame of reference of the viking age is from just pop culture seems like eggers just wanted to make a mediocre fanfilm for the tv show vikings disappointing
Apr 25 2022,positive,amazing film felt like im actually in that era great job
Apr 25 2022,negative,simply not good i have no idea what the positive reviews are about
Apr 25 2022,positive,i enjoyed it  ana taylorjoy was a delight as usual   beautifully shot stylized
Apr 25 2022,positive,the movie was amazing it had great storyline that perfectly complimented the dark and gore filled action scenes the acting aswell along with the special effects was superb was overall a tenten movie
Apr 25 2022,positive,very raw and exceptional
Apr 25 2022,positive,best movie ive seen in a long time
Apr 25 2022,positive,i feel overjoyed that i got to see this on the big screen with an audience my viewings of eggers films have massively grown since being the only one in the theater for the witch on opening night while others may have gone for cheaper tricks to get people into seats eggers focuses on historical tales and accuracies to create an atmosphere like few can i dont have any hopeful movies that i want eggers to tackle my only hope is he gets to make whatever his passions focus on next
Apr 25 2022,positive,great story line you really need to focus to understand the movie and whats going on be warned very gory and dark story line
Apr 25 2022,positive,love the details and settings but eggers needs to shorten his movies his average scripts overstay their welcome he made the same mistake with the lighthouse
Apr 25 2022,positive,great action and story
Apr 25 2022,positive,best alexander skarsgard film in a long time the northman had a very tale as old as time plot but with a sick twist definitely had a strong apocalypto vibe with icelandic  viking rhetoric strong effects and cinematography strong shout out to william dafoe nicole kidman and ethan hawke nicole kidman was a monster this is the one movie i actually liked her acting in the northman has definitely become one of my new top 5 favorites
Apr 25 2022,positive,fantastic movie i didnt think we would ever see again all the books ive read on the vikings seem to come to life on the screen not kid friendly at all but i consider this one of the best films i have ever seen its raw beautiful ugly and guaranteed to leave an impression
Apr 25 2022,positive,slow burn but intense
Apr 25 2022,positive,i cant figure out why people are giving this movie low reviews this movie was epic you should already know going in this is a robert edgars movie this isnt some pop hollywood bs this movie is bussin
Apr 25 2022,positive,the most epic movie of the year its a classic already
Apr 25 2022,negative,uhh honestly just know youll be confused the whole movie
Apr 25 2022,positive,i enjoyed it was a little boring but it payed off the plot was simple but good and theyre were definitely some plot twists and the performances from the whole cast are really good
Apr 25 2022,positive,just got back from seeing the northman a amazing movie very glad i saw it in theaters top notch story cinematography acting directing sound
Apr 25 2022,positive,excellent movie if only for the camera and lighting work skargard is amazing and draws you into his movie the locations the realism the weatherelements are on full display and play to the movies strengths a must see and i hope an award winner
Apr 25 2022,negative,i want my money back this movie was terrible
Apr 25 2022,positive,wowdont know what movie some folks watched  riveting brutal and revenge all wrapped up in a great cinematic experience  we saw in a xd theater and all i can say is wow
Apr 25 2022,positive,its one of the best films released since the start of the pandemic from totally unknown origins i also love that this film is angering all the evil people who want to destroy western culture so it gets an extra  from me
Apr 25 2022,positive,it was really good overall youre just watching the story of a viking set on revenge as the trailer depicts and nothing more decent graphics decent storyline great acting pretty good depiction of norse vs christian beliefs around that era     tw rape i enjoy the way they implied yet did not show rape that would have made it harder for me to stomach the movie its evident in history about vikings in the rapeandpillage mentality but thankfully they didnt show it
Apr 25 2022,positive,too much time wasted on the mystical aspect and not enough fight scenes it does not measure up to 300 or troy but was good
Apr 25 2022,positive,bloodshed betrayal revenge woohoo  but also a love story hmmm
Apr 25 2022,positive,an absolute gnarly piece of cinema
Apr 25 2022,negative,not what i was expecting slow moving really kind of boring which made it feel longer than it was
Apr 25 2022,positive,think conan as a viking meets saw
Apr 25 2022,negative,i love viking shows but half way into this movie i found myself hoping that it was almost over it had potential but it missed the mark in my opinion it was one of the worst movies ive seen in a while 
Apr 25 2022,positive,great action movie  i really liked it and want to see it again
Apr 25 2022,positive,like hamlet with vikings captivating raw experience not an ounce of fat on the movie you feel like youre there with them not watching something made to be viewed by outsiders for entertainment extraordinarily well done eyes were glued to the screen nearly the entire runtime
Apr 25 2022,negative,it was nothing like the trailer
Apr 25 2022,positive,awesome film and great balance of exciting revenge movie and well researched nordic ritual and culture
Apr 25 2022,positive,what an absolutely great movie
Apr 25 2022,neutral,first half is entertaining second half is ridicoulus there was so much opportunity for a better story but it feels like all the effort was spend on the visuals
Apr 25 2022,positive,i have to admit that i was a bit let down with this one it was marketed as a more relatable film from robert eggers yet i felt it was arguably his most distant the film features some exquisite cinematography and some detail oriented set pieces but i found the characters to be a b it less interesting from a film like the lighthouse where characters were meant to carry the plotnot the plot carrying the characters its definitely a well made film but id rather rewatch the lighthouse if i were given the option 
Apr 25 2022,negative,i have seen better on netflixwas not right
Apr 25 2022,positive,youll find no grand tale here nor any kind of complex mystic system what you will find is a broken son and a beautiful aweinspiring place full of mist and field and salty sea truly it was the year of our lord 895 ad
Apr 25 2022,positive,good action movie for the norse legends  however some of the dialog was difficult to hear and understand  all in all it was not a bad entertainment whether or not it was historically accurate of the people of the day
Apr 25 2022,positive,movie depicted life almost exactly as it was at that time  it was like a time machine  going back to that era
Apr 25 2022,positive,enjoyed the ride of this viking quest
Apr 25 2022,positive,ambitious and epic people complain that movies dont do anything original then sleep on stuff like the northman deserves a watch on a big dolby screen very intense
Apr 25 2022,negative,slow boring predictable really rotten pot smoked when they imagine this
Apr 25 2022,neutral,the movie just really wasnt what i expected too much mystical magical fantasy stuff which is just a writing gimmick to ignore real plot lines
Apr 25 2022,positive,incredible film just jawdropping watch if you have any respect for euro history will aid in dismantling the concept of eurocentrism
Apr 25 2022,positive,this is a great movie lots of action great story good acting non stop fighting revenge and honor
Apr 25 2022,positive,for revenge type story it was masterfully put together well paced visually stunning and a oscar caliber performance from skarsgard amazing movie 
Apr 25 2022,negative,fell asleep and that never happens at the theater expected so much trailer have away all good parts
Apr 25 2022,negative,boring and hardto follow
Apr 25 2022,positive,great story action and cinematography
Apr 25 2022,neutral,the preview was better than the movie the history channel told a better viking story
Apr 25 2022,positive,the northman a visual poetry intense beautiful a real saga of fire  ice
Apr 25 2022,positive,awesome movie for the more mature public would recommend not seeing if you have a weak stomach
Apr 25 2022,negative,bizarre perverse slow predicable and half the cast sound more scottish than icelandic we left early it was so bad
Apr 25 2022,negative,6 of us went 2 of us walked out within the first half hour none liked it also it hurt my ears
Apr 25 2022,positive,fantastic film paid a high level of attention to historical accuracy while interpreting norse mythology in a visually amazing way brilliant film
Apr 25 2022,positive,first off hes hott second its a great movie me and my husband were at the edge of our seats
Apr 25 2022,positive,great movie loved it 
Apr 25 2022,positive,a historical epic in every sense of the word nothing bad to say about it though its explicit content may be too much for some viewers
Apr 25 2022,negative,the storyline was terrible and it went on for way too long i would not recommend the movie
Apr 25 2022,negative,i hate writing bad reviews but i feel robbed of the two plus hours of my life ill never get back  the only redeeming part of this movie was the beautiful landscapes
Apr 25 2022,positive,was a thrilling adventure and true as possible historically
Apr 25 2022,positive,i walked out feeling pretty disappointed
Apr 25 2022,negative,it sucked and was boring i wish i could get my money back its beauty doesnt outweigh the dull boredom it induces i struggled to stay awake the entire movie
Apr 25 2022,positive,not horrible they did pretty good with lore however those looking for vikings should find a different movie reminded me of valhalla rising with a different story line
Apr 25 2022,negative,the best part was the ending
Apr 25 2022,positive,amazing film acting action and cinematography are all beyond reproach its an epic story please make more films like this
Apr 25 2022,negative,hard to follow the dialogue for me
Apr 25 2022,neutral,while i did not love this film i did not entirely dislike it i thought the cinematography and lighting was superb and there were some good twists i thought the dialogue choices for the film were a bit curious and slightly hard to follow and some of the stunts during fighting sequences did not always seem natural it felt fairly rehearsed i understood many of the norse mythology references and insets due to other exposure ive had to the mythology however i could see someone who is not as familiar being very confused as there was not much explanation offered
Apr 25 2022,positive,great cinematography great performances memorable visuals immersive to the setting great action pieces
Apr 25 2022,negative,i want to two hours back that i wasted of my life
Apr 25 2022,positive,both a solid revenge film and provoking look at norse beliefs and culture
Apr 25 2022,positive,well done  locations were great they story was good like shakespeare
Apr 25 2022,positive,excellent acting on all of the actors parts there are so many visual details that make it a must see in theaters otherwise missed on a smaller screen
Apr 25 2022,negative,eggers did a nice job setting the mood  the music the set the cinematography all align  and thats the only positive thing i can say about it  the plot is the most basic of revenge tales  it hits a single note  over and over and over again  my girlfriend was very eager to see this  i think she was excited by the promise of muscles  she literally fell asleep  i was very very bored
Apr 25 2022,positive,the revenge plot has been way over done in hollywood the ridiculous nudity could have been dialed back some and the actual fight scenes are way to short    music and production were pretty good as was acting william dafoe is brillant as aways cinematography was gorgeous and the movie wasnt to long very violent movie btw if you are in to that thing or not
Apr 25 2022,positive,i love eggars and again he delivers something i will watch for years to come a epic story of a hero who goes through everything just to reach his fate the attention to norse mythology is breathtaking and the cinematography is just perfect the sights in this movie will live in my head for the next week performances awesome and action top notch my only issue is that there is not enough action toward the 3rd act but who cares when the dialogue is exceptional go see northman it is spectacular and tense right to the very end
Apr 25 2022,negative,story was nothing new acting was terrible aside from skarsgard and his nemesis accents were all trash never should have cast nicole kidman  so many scenes were completely pointless i dont understand why anyone raved about this movie if you really want to watch it wait until its free im glad we caught it at matinee but now i see why there were like 6 people there
Apr 25 2022,positive,sooooo good amazing spin on hamlet and the historical genre highly highly recommend
Apr 25 2022,negative,i want revenge to get my money back 
Apr 25 2022,positive,the action was excellent the story and premise were superb highly recommended def more of a guy flick the woman wasnt as big a fan
Apr 25 2022,negative,i hated the green knight and this movie the northman was only a little better  it was much too long for a revenge story  the extra norse mythology only very minutely provided insight into the storyline  there was so much original language used that it was primarily like watching a foreign film and that could have been forgiven had it not been for the overarching weirdness of the norse mythology inserts
Apr 25 2022,negative,one of the most boring movies ive watched in a while overall weird and unnecessary dialogue with scenes which dont add to the storyline at all
Apr 25 2022,negative,it was funny but dont think it was meant to be the trailer was better than the actual movie
Apr 25 2022,positive,the northman is really good alexander skarsgård is a literal beast in this film the scenery is beautiful to look at the action is bloody and brutal and the rest of the amazing cast gives great performances if you can see this one in dolby cinema it is a great experience that amplifies the quality of the film in every aspect
Apr 25 2022,positive,i liked this movie its true that the trailers were a tad misleading this is more a melodrama with action sequences peppered throughout the story is one filled with love betrayal and of course vengeance the film boasts top notch production values editing and sound the actors perform superbly amongst the very realistic sets created for them my advice to the prospective viewer is to leave your expectations at the door youll be much happier for it there are twists in this films story theres mysticism and warlike raids tenderness and brutality pain and redemption love and finally hope
Apr 25 2022,positive,robert eggers can do no wrong his third film is by far his most commercial movie but it still stays true to his roots of bringing folklore to the big screen 
Apr 25 2022,positive,it was ok the acting was so so nicole kidman has got to stop with the plastic surgery she looks like an alien i had hope this film would fit the hype the trailers were the best part
Apr 25 2022,positive,a beautifullyfilmed epic take of revenge with astounding attention detail never quite strikes the raw nerve of madness that so engrossed this viewer in both the witch and the lighthouse however
Apr 25 2022,positive,good acting i thought the story could have been better
Apr 25 2022,positive,great movie dont expect a ton of action would love to see a conan movie  in this style
Apr 25 2022,negative,this movie is not an action movie it is drama very long drama i personally was kind of bored i like dramas however this one wasnt felt i like korean movies and watch dramas but this movie to me felt too long dragging yes the visuals are very good but it was boring i never felt that aww moment that clap your hands moment it was too long and hardly any action the movie is all talking they just made the point of him killing the person that killed his father stretched out i am trying not to give too much away to me it was too long and felt bored no aww moment or didnt felt the characters
Apr 24 2022,negative,very disappointed the trailer was very misleading  the movie was ok but wasnt what i went for was expecting war action but nothing then ending was horrible
Apr 24 2022,positive,bold dark violent and you kinda know where its going but the detail and performances are so rich you go along for the blood soaked ride  probably not a vegan first date movie but im glad i saw it on a big screen
Apr 24 2022,positive,it was good would watch again
Apr 24 2022,positive,epic bloody supernatural
Apr 24 2022,negative,it was ridiculous   hard pass
Apr 24 2022,negative,no a good movie very dark violent and ritualistic lack of story flow character development and  plot its all revenge and rituals but no explanation for what you see or what is taking place and why was very disappointed  very dark and consumed with anger and resentment there was no character development so there was no character involvement
Apr 24 2022,negative,save two hours of your life and skip it
Apr 24 2022,positive,the best movie ive seen so far this 2022 and yet it hasnt finished haha love the role and commintment of the actors the storie and the photography vikings historie never fail when is well represented talking about the mix of magic and reality
Apr 24 2022,positive,well crafted story with stunning visuals must be experienced on the big screen dont wait for streaming release
Apr 24 2022,neutral,not a great story line too much weird dreaming
Apr 24 2022,positive,the most necessary perfect and most manliest movie that is truly much needed especially during times where hollywood shoves down movies with some libtardsjwfeminazi agenda by forcing it down audiences throats this movie and the batman show you the type of movies everyone wants to watch and be enthralled and be given a reason to watch something worth seeing to the theaters if you cannot handle the sight of pure brutality musclebound antiherioc protagonist slashing his way through anyone or the screams of muscular berserker vikings going to battle then i suggest you stay down your mamas basement and dont come out until you grow a sac
Apr 24 2022,negative,very disappointing difficult to follow and not worth the admission price
Apr 24 2022,negative,dont walk in expecting a lot of battle scenes instead expect watching a lot of rituals  plot twist ok  it can wait till it gets on stream not worth paying a lot in theaters
Apr 24 2022,positive,i watched it with my entire family great fun and a good family movie epic revenge of the sith dual at the end
Apr 24 2022,positive,the film is unexpectedly pleasant it keeps glued to the screen despite the more than two hours of duration  although very often it results in fantasy the attention to details even historical ones amazes as well as the costumes  the actors played their roles perfectly meticulous director and a soundtrack that makes the film even better
Apr 24 2022,positive,it was ok i expected more fighting
Apr 24 2022,positive,not as much action as the previews showed kinda slow movie
Apr 24 2022,negative,it was a little hard to follow it felt like it was rushed through production to catch on with the whole viking obsession on streaming services
Apr 24 2022,positive,its good  i dont know what i was expecting  it all seems otherworldlycirca 895 ad  there was a element of goofiness i cant describe  worth a watch though  visually beautiful
Apr 24 2022,positive,well shot great action story had just a couple kinks but overall a good enjoyable picture
Apr 24 2022,positive,epic brutal and beautifully executed
Apr 24 2022,neutral,good acting by all but the plot lagged i was waiting for the film to end
Apr 24 2022,positive,the type of movie you need to watch in a cinema
Apr 24 2022,positive,very exciting great drama
Apr 24 2022,positive,an amazing accomplishment for robert eggers and his crew both behind the scenes and in front of the camera as original as his first two films the witch and the lighthouse eggers is one of the most original directors to come along in a while highly recommended 
Apr 24 2022,negative,what a waste of my time the trailers and cast look promising i want my money back
Apr 24 2022,positive,best movie ive seen all year so far
Apr 24 2022,positive,reminded me of the history channel vikings kidman was not the female star of the show
Apr 24 2022,neutral,this movie is disappointing the trailer makes you think its a berserker viking conquest movie and thats not what you get at all the only battle sequence is the one in the trailer and then you merge into a total slow burn which okay the visuals are cool and some people will probably tell you this is an awesome movie but its all been done before the story is just the same hamlet story retold its a massive let down instead of a slow burn they should have just got rid of the revenge plot and just went for action the director had the opportunity to film it with the right style to show carnage and instead went for the weird mystique merging legends with psychological strangeness that just didnt work for me
Apr 24 2022,positive,well thought out storyline and characters unique and complex story not your normal revenge movie well shot looks fantastic viking fantasy done better than most may be indie ish but you cant tell based on quality a must watch
Apr 24 2022,positive,great movie what a twist
Apr 24 2022,positive,the fight scenes were great the acting was great and the camera work was fantastic eggers always delivers and i hope he makes another if you get the chance to go see this movie go see it
Apr 24 2022,negative,not at all what i expected psychedelic  surrealistic
Apr 24 2022,positive,northman is poetically brutal adaptation of grammaticus simple but concise it weaves a beautiful web of norse life with a often told tale of revenge some finer points might be lost on people who have little or no knowledge of norse culture but its still enjoyable by all who dare to weather its aggression
Apr 24 2022,positive,a good movie not for kids but true to the times brutal on occasion but thats what life was like back then acting was good but many american movie goers will probably not appreciate the ending that being said there could have been more character development but a movie is only so long therefore
Apr 24 2022,positive,i prefer rating on a scale of 1100 this movie scoring an 8588100 in my book cinematography was amazing acting was amazing more action than your typical robert eggers movie and i enjoyed the story though the plot is not the most original while it found it quite enjoyable i dont think there are many memorable moments from this movie or reason to watch it beyond 23 times altogether that said i absolutely think the northman is worth watching but i can understand why audiences with simpler tastes might not fully enjoy it as it is devoid of the fastpaced actionpacked straightforward stories that average moviegoers have come to expect 
Apr 24 2022,negative,nothing really say about it no impact on any of story  line it was just boring
Apr 24 2022,negative,what a missed opportunity
Apr 24 2022,positive,if you have not seen the directors other films you will not like this one dark brutal surreal beautiful and a sight to see will forever have a lasting impact in the revengethriller genre
Apr 24 2022,negative,wasnt that great of a movie it was kinda slow and didnt do viking movies justice in my opinion 
Apr 24 2022,positive,probably closer to how tribal vikings really lived but that will not satisfy most action hero crowds
Apr 24 2022,negative,first half so cheezy and slow second half not much better surprised i didnt fall asleep probably the worse roll ive ever seen nicole kidman in
Apr 24 2022,negative,it was horrible barley any fighting and going to get the sword was so dumb
Apr 24 2022,negative,the movie was boring
Apr 24 2022,negative,confusing as hell  i dont understand how anyone could say this is a good movie
Apr 24 2022,positive,this movie was very moving and horribly wonderful at the same time it was probably the best depiction of the true norseman and what it was like living in that time during viking culture it probably wont be a movie for everyone 
Apr 24 2022,positive,amazing movie this is a robert eggers movie through and through not a blockbuster like the trailers and posters make it out to be very personal story extremely visceral all props and settings were built to complete historical accuracy but the film heavily plays into norse mythology lore gorgeous cinematography and fantastic acting accross the board up there for best film of the year so far
Apr 24 2022,positive,movies was awesome  great story line and great actors and actresses
Apr 24 2022,positive,absolutely love this movie its gorgeous and the action and music are all amazing ill watch pretty much anything with alexander skarsgard hes such an underrated talent the movie beautifully captures the story of amleth the magic of norse mythology is added just the right amount all the actors clearly cared and put their all into their performances the authentic atmosphere of the norse and seeing the land of the rus was really exciting as its not something we really ever see i love norse culture and this have a really amazing experience of it i highly recommend the movie
Apr 24 2022,neutral,the film had the chance to be great it settled for being good      anya taylorjoys performance was definitely the highlight of the film
Apr 24 2022,negative,terrible absolutely horrible do not waste your time or money
Apr 24 2022,negative,boring and characters were awful  watch the vikings series instead
Apr 24 2022,positive,this movie was great im not an indie movie fan in the slightest but this was really good the plot may have been a typical revenge story but the cinematography acting and fight scenes all made up for it just dont go in expecting a anout action movie this is not it this is mostly drama with a few fights but those fights are brutal
Apr 24 2022,negative,awful movie absolutely terrible
Apr 24 2022,positive,a good movie have seen it twice will buy on 4k
Apr 24 2022,neutral,no epic tale here fight scenes seemed slow on purpose i was comparing to the last kingdom   disappointing 
Apr 24 2022,positive,it was great lots of action had me on edge whiting for what was going to happen next plenty of blood and love seans
Apr 24 2022,negative,dialog very hard to understand  muddering  disjointed plot  special effects distract from story line  what there was of it  very disappointed
Apr 24 2022,positive,great visuals on a classic tale
Apr 24 2022,positive,excellent dark and raw great sense of what it might possibly have been like 
Apr 24 2022,negative,it was green knight meets hereditary with add in of a few fight scenes great art film if thats what your there for if you like a long build up to a fight scene then you may like it my gawd though was it long and drug out to get to as few seconds of any action
Apr 24 2022,positive,bad movie one of the years best so far
Apr 24 2022,negative,not even close to being worth one star worse movie i have seen in a while
Apr 24 2022,positive,great cinematography but mediocre plot
Apr 24 2022,negative,i walked out after 30 minutes
Apr 24 2022,negative,it made me sick to the stomach and not really something to watch on a nice sunday evening i thought is more historical rather than just a blood bath
Apr 24 2022,positive,robert eggers raw brilliance is getting stronger with his storytelling i cannot wait for his next film
Apr 24 2022,positive,a very visceral graphic viking experience worth seeing at the theaters
Apr 24 2022,positive,the northman is a brutal and epic movie recommended
Apr 24 2022,positive,when you see how much effort has gone into making this movie you just have to love and respect it absolute must see
Apr 24 2022,positive,it was very entertaining in a mythological way
Apr 24 2022,positive,910 90100  robert eggers has yet to disappoint me most audience dont have the filmstory intellect to truly see his gift and what hes accomplishing dont listen to them
Apr 24 2022,positive,skarsgård and kidman are phenomenal in this exquisite piece of cinema
Apr 24 2022,negative,movie was horrible they showed the best parts in trailer
Apr 24 2022,positive,epic fantastic dark brooding wild visually stunning it sticks to the actual history and doesnt try and mix things in that werent true to that part of the world back then great job 
Apr 24 2022,positive,movie is good but it couldve ended so much sooner but instead it just dragged on and on like dude just kill the guy and be over with it
Apr 24 2022,positive,movie was great other than the sidebars to the sides left right on a amc theater
Apr 24 2022,negative,it had nothing to do with history  had no excitement kept waiting for something to happen  and nothing happened worth our time  worst movie weve seen so far this season  my wife is a history lover  and thought it might at least resemble a little history nope well got over that part  thought it was going to be an action film  and kept waiting on the action  and nope 
Apr 24 2022,positive,omg it was sooo good i definitely recommend it its such a good story line  i would watch it again the sound the setting it was fantastic hats off to the actors that pulled it off 100 recommend to watch it
Apr 24 2022,positive,fantastic film if you enjoy icelandic viking sagas  this is probably one of the best translations from an old saga to film i have ever seen  it captures that feeling right down to the pacing which may be a bit jarring for some audiences if youre not expecting it  the marketing is a little misleading toodont expect the entire film to be filled with action  instead the action  fighting is actually used very sparingly and it is quite satisfying when those moments do arrive   there are strong themes about destiny  choosing your own path which are really at the heart of what the film is about  the cast is great and the cinematography is exquisiteworth a watch for those reasons alone
Apr 24 2022,positive,loved the movie if you like norse mythos you will love it too it isnt nonstop action but its exactly what the previews lead you to believe it will be anyone who doesnt like this movie believed it would be different than the previews the acting was great the story was great the mythos was amazing id give this 6 stars if it was possible
Apr 24 2022,negative,acting was poor action was poor only watch if you need to get out of the rain
Apr 24 2022,positive,awesome movie the direction by eggers is top tier and the writing and cinematography are on another level
Apr 24 2022,positive,too long could have been a half hour shorter relentless battle and violence effective music and artistic scenes no token blacks in 10th century viking country which was refreshing nice icelandic scenery
Apr 24 2022,positive,what if you adapted a centuries old myth for 2022 but instead of adapting it you meticulously recreated its every detail and fully bought into its worldview only eggers can so faithfully create old worlds that now seem as alien to us as alternate universes would see again in a second
Apr 24 2022,positive,one of the most historically accurate and perfect viking movies ive ever seen
Apr 24 2022,negative,the action scenes were the only good thing about this movie the story line was limited and very predictable expecting so much more from this all star cast
Apr 24 2022,positive,i liked how the movie was an artsy viking movie  if you are into icelandic sagas you will get what is expected
Apr 24 2022,positive,i was expecting something more not fully entertaining and a little weird in some parts
Apr 24 2022,positive,if you like viking sagas and love truistic battle scenes this should be for you  we really enjoyed it  a little slow for a bit in the middle but picked up quick  characters were not the most likable  but hey they are potraying brutal conquerors
Apr 24 2022,negative,weird paganistic dark violent i wanted to like this film i really truly did but i was expecting something more akin to gladiator or braveheart and instead got something completely left field that seems to borrow from shakespeare but becomes something entirely baffling at times i dont know im just nonplussed by the experience 610 i think its going to be a polarizer for sure for audiences
Apr 24 2022,negative,bad enough to make a rotten tomatoes account to say its bad
Apr 24 2022,negative,concept of movie was ok but function of telling the story was a bit much  boring at times nichole kidman owes me a movie pass
Apr 24 2022,negative,i wanted to leave after first 10 mins and regretted staying til the end because my family thot  well were here already no real plot could have been edited shorter by an hour felt like a 5 hr movie id have preferred to sear my eyes out with a hot poker many nonsensical unnecessary scenes that did nothing to further the story cringe and more cringe love most anything about vikings but this was a complete disappointment we should have been paid to have to sit through this complete torture
Apr 24 2022,positive,it was an interesting and good movie
Apr 24 2022,negative,i wish i had the 25 hours of my life back
Apr 24 2022,negative,such a disappointment all i wanted was viking gladiator or maybe vikingjohnwick some nice clean revenge with swords with almost nude taylorjoy thrown in but no its twoplus hours of silly faux viking rituals silly fake heroic dialogue that would be better in a comic book and weird unexplained mysticism that also is silly and inconsequential on top of that the hero needlessly dillydallies getting his revenge for no apparent reason other than a movie can t be an hour long and it all leads to a pretty unsatisfying and silly ending the hero deserves those quotes too after we watch him years after pledging revenge doing some routine raping and pillaging and burning to death of children with his viking homies having seemingly procrastinated on the revenge project for his whole adult life andwere supposed to root for this guy credit to skaarsgard sp for getting into superhero shape in his 40s for this role butugh youd be wise to just skip it or wait until its free on one of your streaming services to see how bad it is
Apr 24 2022,positive,great period time piece if you want to know what it was like in 900 ad this is it really graphic but the story is realistic for the era thank god i wasnt born then
Apr 24 2022,negative,this movie was not what the trailers would lead you to believe yes it is a revenge tale thats where the similarities end     there are maybe 45 action scenes throughout the movie the choreography seems very slow like theyre fighting at about 70 speed in some cases it looks goofy theyre somewhat fun but also feel weird     the crushing part of this movie was how loremagic heavy it was the trailer wouldnt seem to make it out this way but there is so much in the way of weird and overly drawn out  moments of magic and speaking with a seer and prophecy it was way overdone     to top it off the overall story was very incoherent multiple times the protagonist has the opportunity to easily take his revenge ending the movie and after all sorts of build up to the moment essentially says meh the prophecy said this doesnt happen this way and the scene immediately ends it felt so disjointed by the time the movie really starts to pick up in about the final 3045 minutes i was so bored with all the plot holes it couldnt redeem itself     so far i have walked out of 2 movies ever after about 30 minutes i wanted to walk out on this one but stayed i really wish i had gone with my gut and walked out it was 2 hours i will never get back
Apr 24 2022,positive,awesome movie  doesnt get enough credit as it should  ppl think this is about pillaging and looting but no you want that then go watch vikings the tv show  this movie is about vengeance and redemption  i love this film  a definite must watch 
Apr 24 2022,positive,was a decent movie  not what i was expecting but still entertaining
Apr 24 2022,negative,horrible movie thought it would be more like viking battles and it was more satanic than anything else
Apr 24 2022,positive,its certainly not for those that are interested in a mindless viking action movie but thats not to say its lacking in actual martial conflict its a bit hard to explain kind of like how titane starts as a slasher film from the perspective of the killer before becoming a body horror family drama i will say that the movie is worth watching if youre in the mood for a slow burn and if youre someone whos read the prose edda youll get more millage out of it however the story like the edifice is very basic and saved mostly by its characters impeccable attention to detail and performances
Apr 24 2022,negative,hollywood in its overall greatness has achieved something amazing again they made vikings boring the plot is nonsensical the movie is slow as hell the characters are idiotic the lore is all over the place the motivations are basically ignored it is predictable if you liked the green knight crap you will like this same kind of greatness  the men are weak and stupid crap is all over the place the unnecessary sexual undertones for no reason its just a stupid waste of time of course it has a great rating by the critics
Apr 24 2022,positive,slow moving few action scenes seemed to be more of an art film trying to convey the angst of waiting decades for revenge great acting cannot fully rescue the project
Apr 24 2022,negative,the action was good thats about it the story is copied from elsewhere and this version was quite bland i loved the viking aspect of the movie but it wasnt well done
Apr 24 2022,positive,incredible plunge into a viking and norse world in mind spirit and body amazing original musical score fantastic visuals and atmosphere brutal heartbreaking and mesmerizing   not for the faint of heart
Apr 24 2022,positive,the film gets a little anticlimactic toward the end but i think the northman is a big achievement in filmmaking
Apr 24 2022,negative,slow developing the actors seem to have mailed it in in many instances  drug on for far too long  beautiful scenery but i wonder how close to actual norse history culture beliefs and traditions this movie came  id give it about a 6 out o 10 overall
Apr 24 2022,positive,stunning visuals beautifully executed many people here saying that it is gross and too violent well its a movie about vikings so i dont know what else they were expecting loved the mythological side of it too
Apr 24 2022,negative,very disappointed with this movie i had to leave with 45 minutes left it was that boring its a shame as its got some good actors in the film but disappointed
Apr 24 2022,negative,wouldnt waste your time watching at home for free
Apr 24 2022,positive,gritty violent revenge filled tale think lion king meets braveheart the actingcinematography is great the story is a simple nonagenda filled tale that hollywood doesnt make anymorethe fantastical elements may not be for everyones taste typical in a robert eggers film which is why i gave it a lower score but overall enjoyable
Apr 24 2022,positive,amazing mix of earlymedieval history norse mythology and sagas its not another dumb blockbuster or highlyinaccurate netflix series this is a definitive viking movie best so far pacing is the only problem movie is a little slow in the middle but it is a minor issue excellent cinematography costumes acting 55
Apr 24 2022,positive,slow to start beautiful scenery some weirdness its okay not bad
Apr 24 2022,positive,i find it absolutely insane for any bad reviews on this movie from the get go it was a thrill of course viking movies or shows have a little odd twists happening but the portrayal of the culture was incredible honestly im a hard critic myself but this was literally a 1010 for me
Apr 24 2022,positive,i really enjoyed this movie it wont be for everyone it is very artsy and weird in a good way absolutely gorgeous shots with a very creative style
Apr 24 2022,positive,couldnt understand what was being said half the time  good action but dumb plot
Apr 24 2022,positive,great action cast and plot for a viking movie this one is up there you can see it will head into a saga without giving it away sequel is coming
Apr 24 2022,negative,apparently a good review requires you to drop an f bomb speaks a bit to who this show will appeal to i guess i dont walk out of movies but after having sat through 2 hours of this pointless nonsense i wish i would have it never got better never have i wished for the gore to get over with so they could develop the story but i found myself wishing for that in this case acting is fine realistic gore what little scenery they show is okay but you dont care one iota about anyone or anything in this bleak dark predictable tale boring and forgettable
Apr 24 2022,negative,sadly very weak over hyped movie dreadfully directed interminably dragged out with one dimensional acting no wonder the top billed actors dont hang around in it for long wouldnt even bother to re watch it if it comes on tv
Apr 24 2022,negative,terrible film  ishtar quality  no meaningful dialogue development  other than a broad sense of foreboding undeveloped acting
Apr 24 2022,positive,this film was based on the norse myth that inspired shakespeares hamlet  its a visionary work that must be seen on the big screen  excellent pacing acting cinematography and script  a must see      if you dont like this movie its because you hate movies
Apr 24 2022,negative,the film started off a little odd but i had to be open to idea of viking folklore and their interpretation of their gods and nature the films costumes cinematography and battle scenes were top notch however the story line was so choppy and anticlimactic that it was very predictable and yet left a lot of plot holes maybe if youre a viking expert this is a movie youll like
Apr 24 2022,positive,took viking life to a whole new level a loud gory vengeful movie small cast and good writing acting was a bit meh on some bits but overall a fantastic and fun watch highly recommended if you enjoyed something similar like beowulf
Apr 24 2022,negative,this was the worst movie ive seen since mother aweful
Apr 24 2022,negative,disappointed there was a lot of mysticism mushrooms symbolism and little action at the end i was just hoping for everyone to die so that the movie could end the actors did great  but the plot and script were terrible wait for streaming
Apr 24 2022,positive,raw and gory a testosterone fueled masterpiece
Apr 24 2022,positive,unexpected and highly needed had the exact amount of everything and at the same time was full of surprises
Apr 24 2022,positive,underwhelming never got attached to the storyline or the main characters wonderful acting though 2 hour movie felt like 5 hours
Apr 24 2022,positive,definitely deeper than tv shows about vikings not as much action packed but really good
Apr 24 2022,positive,it was the lion king without cute animals or singing  a tired story of revenge that has been done better in many other movies
Apr 24 2022,negative,long boring and bleak a very simple minimal plot is stretched out for no apparent reason the main characters were one dimensional so you really couldnt get invested in their struggle
Apr 24 2022,positive,this is a masterpiece robert eggers beautifully displays the essence of norse mythology in an operalike film embedded in a jawdropping cinematography the story is simple but well narrated and its used as a mean to explore the folklore and culture of those ancient civilisations here the director took great care on historical and mythological details  the expert usage of long takes during action scenes contributes to further elevate the overall beauty of this picture
Apr 24 2022,negative,worst movie i have ever seen should have walked out of the cinema time wasted
Apr 24 2022,positive,the movie is an amazing depiction of what norse culture is  i saw a lot of reviews stating the violence and gore was too much but that should be expected the medieval days of europe were some of the darkest and bloodies days    the shamanwitch scenes are as if written in the poetic edda a fever dream a prediction  a vision of the future    for the people stating why are there only white people  go read a history book europe is a continent of white people
Apr 24 2022,neutral,i thought the acting in the first part of this movie was just trash  ethan hawks performance wasnt great  the rituals at the beginning were just overthetop ridiculous and just made me cringe  it was like watching a bad high school play  even the fighting at the beginning seemed lazy and they just had skaarsgard walk around slowly acting tough through a raid scene  the second part of the movie was better but it fell short of redeeming the ridiculous first half of the movie  i only stayed because i wanted to finish my popcorn
Apr 24 2022,positive,this was an epic and awesome movie that should not disappoint if you like this type of movie  its violent and parts are gruesome but its the way they fought and the weapons they used
Apr 24 2022,negative,waste of time this is a straight too video movie
Apr 24 2022,positive,enjoyed this movie if youre into norse mythology youll really appreciate it
Apr 24 2022,negative,solid acting and visually stunning but a horrific script
Apr 24 2022,negative,ive not been this disappointed in a movie since in a longtime and considering some of the garbage movies lately that says a lot it felt like the intent was to be artsy and it failed to be entertainment just awfuli left before it even finished and i really wanted to like this
Apr 24 2022,negative,a new low for hollywood violence against women hate and brutality  there are no redeeming features for this movie and it will leave you with a sick feeling when it is over  it is a waste of time and money and shows how desperate hollywood is to put out trash in an attempt to get people into the theater
Apr 24 2022,negative,hard to follow story very long could not wait until it was over
Apr 24 2022,negative,not at all what we expected
Apr 24 2022,negative,this was an unimitgated disaster the writing is so bad and weird i actually laughed out loud in the theater anja taylor joy usually a fine actress is forced to speak in a shitty polish accent there is virtually no story and each scene feels genuinely random its interminable and laughable and shows what studiobought moronic herd animals critics really are this is my generations wild wild west which i found far more entertaining
Apr 24 2022,positive,not for those who think life was gentle in the 9th century ad  good movie
Apr 24 2022,negative,terrible movie waste of time and money stay away
Apr 24 2022,positive,fory  but amazing acting  interesting story
Apr 24 2022,neutral,too grouse  liked the ending with two babies
Apr 24 2022,positive,epic viking tale thanks to a superb cast and fantastic direction  the actors are excellent with alexander skarsgard giving a breakout lead performance as amleth while anya taylorjoy is brings layers to what should be a simple love interest role  the real surprise is nicole kidman as queen gudrin who is not what you expect  behind the camera writerdirector robert eggers delivers his usual mix of  historically accurate movie with a mix of fantasy and drama  he doesnt flinch from the viking world showing them raping women and enslaving people along with providing some epic action sequences a onetake invasion of a village is a standout  he also delivers a film with some nice subtly as well as amleths quest isnt so clean cut as he believes  all in all one of the most unique and brilliant films of 2022 so far
Apr 24 2022,neutral,boring predictable script didnt help getting in some big name actors to try to pull it off  people walked out the theatre i stuck it to the bitter end sadly disappointing with many historical errors stunning islandic scenery and a couple of good throat singing scenes what about that disney ending though
Apr 24 2022,negative,absolutely terrible dialogue plot was very predictable this wouldnt even make a good saturday afternoon show to put on to take a nap we walked out after 30 minutes
Apr 24 2022,negative,one of the worst movies ive ever seen some people actually walked out violent bloody and story line was very hard to follow 
Apr 24 2022,positive,stone cold brutal visceral and f brilliant
Apr 24 2022,positive,compelling story and beautiful scenery really immersive wonderful cast alexander skarsgard carries the film
Apr 24 2022,positive,certainly entertaining but very bizarre
Apr 24 2022,neutral,this movie is missing something they just didnt go far enough 
Apr 24 2022,negative,this ranked as one of the worst movies i have ever seen  the scenes were super long and the plot was very disjointedi was initially excited that this movie was in the theatre  after watching the series vikings which was unbelievably great     i have never walked out of a movie before but did so after 45 minutes of my waiting for the movie to gel
Apr 24 2022,neutral,its 135 minutes when it could easily have been 80 since there arent more than 80 minutes of plot  story the rest is a bunch of bros posturing like they just watched fight club  cant wait to show how manly they are to cover for their lusting for each others bodies so we get dudes bathed in blood because they are men and somehow this impressed critics
Apr 24 2022,positive,a brutal viking revenge tale its the hamlet story we all know and there is a shakespearean tragedy feel here the film has some of the best cinematography ive ever seen  with lighting and onlocation shots the musical score is heartpounding with the nordic sounding drums and chants the film feels so historically accurate and authentic robert eggers and his team really tried to immerse you completely into the place and time the cast is all spectacular particularly skarsgard who is just a beast in this unfortunately this film wont do well at the box office please go out and support it we need more films like this
Apr 24 2022,positive,the detail and presentation were expertly crafted       the plot was straightforward but the unfolding of the story was well paced and sets up each chapter in a manor that makes the tale feel familiar while simultaneously showing us something new and captivating
Apr 24 2022,negative,north atlantic nonsense  very tedious based on a script seeking nominations for most clichés  the wooden acting is caught in a desperate race for shock value if you like muddy men endlessly screaming whilst hacking at other this is the film for you  we actually walked out about half an hour from the end because by that time we really didnt care who won
Apr 24 2022,negative,the story is too simple for its cinematic scope the mythological elements clash with the hyperrealistic world and environment and it is entirely too long for this simplistic story with pacing that had me checking my watch every 20 minutes i also had many issues with the story dialogue characters and plot clarity that ill get into with a couple of specific examples in the last paragraph the film ultimately felt like a slideshow of clips reenacting every viking tradition that involved disembowelment corpse multination andor the casual murder of slaves and animals i felt awful leaving the theater and in hindsight id have been wise to leave after the 1st act    all that said it is visually and audibly very well crafted and nicole kidman steals the show in the one and only wellwritten and dramatic character scene in the entire film i recommend you find your vikingnorse mythology fix elsewhere    spoilers    getting into my issues with the script  on the surface this story is your gardenvariety mythological prophecy trope except this prophecy from the gods is not really very triumphant heroic or even interesting the prophecy is that our protagonists king father is going to get murdered by his uncle for the crown in which his uncle will promptly lose the kingdom due to incompetence so years later our orphaned prince will be told by some seer that he needs to stop pussyfooting around and seek vengeance on his uncle he will then enact this vengeance by slaughtering an entire small farming village and dying himself what a prophecy all this for no real payoff aside from that he gets to go to valhalla for dying in battle even though he also murdered dozens of innocent bystanders who were not involved in the killing of his father which includes his adolescent halfbrother and his brotherinlawcousin combo at one point the film feels like it wants you to be cheering for the protagonist in a moment of triumph as he murders 2 of his bilcousins drinking buddies who are completely uninvolved in his dads murder plot and mutilates their corpses into a banksy on the side of a hut    now to the characters at no point did i feel any sort of connection to the protagonist nor did i have any motivation to hate the primary antagonist as he wasnt any more evil than any other viking including our hero our villains atrocities were that he killed his brother for the crown and then he slit a bunch of slaves throats the former being familial murder which is something our protagonist does plenty of himself and the latter being slavepeasant murder which is something that every member of the village apparently does on a daily basis and vikings sometimes do just for the fun of it when rowing down a river nicole kidman really felt like a good villain after that excellent scene in her bedroom quarters with our hero but then she gets killed very swiftly the next time we see her before the ultimate showdown with his uncle so all we really get out of our actual villain is that one monologue the entire film     finally we get to our wet fart of a romance plot they seemingly fall in love after talking for a whole 2 minutes on screen most of which they are just talking strategy for their escaperevenge there is no emotional connection in their dialogue no chemistry on screen and we do get 2 love scenes the first comes from our hero receiving permission to bed her for one night as a reward from his slavemaster for saving the princes life and the 2nd our protagonist just wakes up in a hot spring and immediately gets to sexing his lady friend because she sent some crows or some shit to save him    overall the dialogue is never anything to write home about and the pacing had me zoning out of the story from act 2 on fuck this script
Apr 24 2022,positive,the movies visuals were stunning and had a sense of folktale truth however visuals metaphors with no other plan but to confuse and have a sense of deeper meaning dont necessarily carry the movie as intended for me the casting was amazing it felt like the character believe every word they spoke the fights were well choreographed and the tale of a son avenging his father was completed an easy story on paper but beautifully done by robert eggers overall a good watch and might be one of the best this year has to offer
Apr 24 2022,negative,horrible no character development weak acting way too long plot had potential and i expected much more from this movie based on the cast but they cant work with a weak script disappointing
Apr 24 2022,negative,fragmented story fooled by critics review of 89 story broke apart in the middle
Apr 24 2022,positive,kick ass action its good to see an old school movie like this
Apr 24 2022,negative,bad just bad attempt at being like 300 or apocalypto
Apr 24 2022,positive,kinda disappointing at the end but still badass910
Apr 24 2022,positive,cinematography and storyline was terrific if you are a weakly and dont like gore blood and guts then this movie is not for you thats why some people are disliking it
Apr 24 2022,negative,its like a slower more boring version of conan
Apr 24 2022,positive,i loved it from start to finish a lot of weird moments which i loved and the twist at the end was cool i just wish there was more closure at the end
Apr 24 2022,positive,a brutal tale of vengeance  fate that revives simple storytelling with masterful execution an absolute mustwatch for history  movie buffs alike    the gladiator of its time
Apr 24 2022,negative,this movie was the worst movie ive ever seen the previews made it out to seem like a totally different movie just the first 15 minutes in almost had my wife and i ready to walk out there are a lot of raunchy scenes and even incest would not recommend

Apr 24 2022,positive,actually a masterpiece
Apr 24 2022,positive,great movie visceral and epic story is a little simple but overall great movie
Apr 24 2022,positive,the scenery is breathtaking you will get a pretty good depiction of viking world raids religion beliefs superstition it was rated r some scenes are shocking gore the movie is a masterpiece well directed supposedly shakespeare based hamlet in the story of prince amleth
Apr 24 2022,positive,the northman was an absolute cinematic masterpiece by far one of if not the greatest film in all of film history   from the excellent pacing to the astounding visuals to the tightknit and emotionally dense narrative weather you are a fan of spectacle or deep jungian  symbolism it will have you at the edge of your seat through its entire runtime   it is the best film i have seen since paul thomas andersons there will be blood   if you have not seen this movie do yourself a favor go to your nearest cinema and see it as soon as you possibly can you will not regret it
Apr 24 2022,negative,it was visually too dark the story went nowhere granted there were some cool shots i left the theatre 2 hours in
Apr 24 2022,negative,dont believe the hype  this piece of junk has no redeeming qualities  anyone with a thirdgrade education knows that the vikings named iceland iceland not because it was a barren waste but to trick raiders away from its shores  the movie doesnt even get that right
Apr 24 2022,negative,a bit odd and gory hard to follow
Apr 24 2022,positive,the northman always has something you can look at every shot is beautiful and the set pieces are breathtaking
Apr 24 2022,positive,story line was easy to follow visuals were absolutely stunning alexander and anya were truly the stars of this film definitely recommend this film absolutely amazing
Apr 24 2022,negative,i like a good story of vengeance but this one was just too much and too long
Apr 24 2022,negative,just wasted time i could have used to clean the toilet
Apr 24 2022,positive,one of the more realistic viking film in terms of clothing atmosphere artillery it game me vibes of the last duel with more action and fantasy overall its well done ill have watch it again to fully understand and appreciate the symbolism 
Apr 24 2022,negative,this was a contract ending a list actor round up worst viking movie period dont waste your evening unless paying to take a nap in the theatre suits you plenty better on netflix and other online networks
Apr 24 2022,positive,really good much faster paced than other robert eggers movies but a tad too long somewhat
Apr 24 2022,positive,good camera work beautiful from beginning to end spirited fight scenes were welcomed
Apr 24 2022,positive,is dark and bloody aptly reflects the madness and rage of shakespeares play
Apr 24 2022,negative,main character shoulda died as a kid
Apr 24 2022,positive,trailer was kinda deceiving but the movie was ok i guess idk actually lol
Apr 24 2022,negative,it was horribleway too loud and there wasnt much of a story linewalked out of the theatre halfway thru
Apr 24 2022,negative,ugh the scenery is amazing but it never really decided if it was art film or trash 
Apr 24 2022,negative,the horse died i will never recover but the action was good
Apr 24 2022,negative,wish someone would have told me how boring this was the heros journey was ruined by bizarre tryhard hollywood writing at least iceland is beautiful for the cinematography
Apr 24 2022,positive,a viking poem if there was such a thing maybe there is but this is it  if your looking for lots of action like the trailer  make it seems well this aint it  its a viking story with myth breed into it with the harsh  viking lore and cool myths lots of rituals woven in this just drips of a manowar wet dream if you know the band then yeah  the visuals the cast all work one the best viking tales that feels like  i said viking poetry will go into my fantasy film collection  just i think it audience score is because of the marketing like watch the trailer seems like they aimed wrong  should been aimed its story and maybe this been better review by right folk anyway its not for everyone of your looking for viking epic saga that has some action myths and brutal acuracy of the time this is it  it is not action film
Apr 24 2022,positive,a historical cinematic masterpiece of epic proportions
Apr 24 2022,negative,i was excited to see this movie with high expectations because of my love for old historical fiction but i really hated this movie i loved the viking series so i looked forward to seeing this movie in addition its disappointing to see your favorite actors in a movie like this i know most are past their prime but they surely can get better parts than this they missed many details that wouldve made the film so much better i was expecting a normal movie this was anything but the strange grotesque scenes throughout this movie were very difficult to watch and hard to understand with some creativity this could have been a great movie i think the writers and producers are out of touch and fail to understand what an audience would like in a movie two thumbs down
Apr 24 2022,positive,the best viking movie you will ever see
Apr 24 2022,negative,rip off of conan the barbarian i had high hopes for this movie but it was just long and boring
Apr 24 2022,negative,hard to follow very bloody not much of a story line
Apr 24 2022,positive,this movie is badass its ballsy brutal and beastly and unconcerned with your emotions this film is raw
Apr 24 2022,negative,this was one of the worst movies ive seen in a long time all around just terrible and cringe worthy
Apr 24 2022,negative,horrible movie i found myself constantly looking at my watch i had such high hopes for this movie very boring very weird and just not a good movie no real direction bouncing all over the place 
Apr 24 2022,positive,genuinely embarrassed for anyone that thought a robert eggers film was going to be like the tv show vikings lollllllll  this movie is psychotic and a mustsee on the big screen  yes the plot is simple and yes the dialogue could have been more rich  but this is a fucking insane movie  only betas will dislike sorry
Apr 24 2022,negative,too cinematic failed to tell a real story
Apr 24 2022,neutral,a bit too extreme for the general public  but wrought with meaning for those that are norse lore followers i would guess
Apr 24 2022,positive,a beautifully shot viking revenge tale i liked that it didnt roam too far into norse magic and stayed on course for a very welldone story
Apr 24 2022,positive,thought there would be more action get rid of the singing in the one part a good netflix movie maybe
Apr 24 2022,positive,i want to see more just  more  of this gritty rustic viking brutal era the movie itself its as close to a masterpiece of viking movies as one can be
Apr 24 2022,negative,it do not like it at all a very strait forward story with a lot of unreal mystical synergies
Apr 24 2022,positive,beautifully filmed and acted movie  alexander skarsgard is a beast of a man   this movie is not for the faint of heart  its gritty and violent  its one of the most authentic depictions of vikings that i have ever seen  the landscapes are gorgeous as is the star filled night sky of iceland  its based on the saga of amelth which was the inspiration for shakespeares hamlet so the story is a familiar one  lots of mythical references seers valkyrie norse gods  its been hours since i saw it and its still with me  lots of layers to think on and process  its really well executed  the attention to detail is very evident and i think it will be considered a masterpiece of viking films  the bar is now very high
Apr 24 2022,positive,excellent and quite faithful to norse culture unlike the distasteful spinoff vikings show on netflix this movie contains plenty of beards an interesting take on a revenge tale bloody rage fueled combat rituals awesome performances from the whole cast and beautiful cinematography to relish in sadly quite a few in the audience didnt agree and labeled it as garbage or a waste of time i am disillusioned with the modern audience to say the least
Apr 24 2022,positive,absolutely amazing film gritty dark brutal and beautiful in its own way very well acted and stayed true to 900 ad norse culture be warned this isnt for everyone if you cant handle unapologetic dark tales with gore and brutal violence id recommend you pass on it but everyone else it is a must see
Apr 24 2022,positive,very good movie intense this is why i go to the movies
Apr 24 2022,positive,very slow and leaves a lot to be desired was happy that it ended
Apr 24 2022,neutral,the story line not enough
Apr 24 2022,positive,good story good performances not a sit back and watch film effort on the part of the audience is definitely required also the ending is predictable pretty gory so be prepared
Apr 24 2022,negative,too dark and chaotic to follow the nonexistent story
Apr 24 2022,negative,just an awful movie  acting was the worst and plot was pathetic  would give it zero if i could  left halfway through  complete waste of time and money
Apr 24 2022,positive,the northman has a bit of a goofy start but once you get into the grit of the movie it shapes into a well shot and somewhat existential movie not a bad watch by any means
Apr 24 2022,positive,the northman holy crap  this movie is epic  epic  it has sweeping landscapes sweeping storytelling  it is brutal and savage and that may not be for everyone but it fits the time period we are watching  it is amazing any of us are here  robert eggers is one hell of a director  people were clapping when it ended  you just want to scream ahhhhhhh to the moon afterwards lol  it is one hell of a movie
Apr 24 2022,negative,lacked solid acting chops and difficult to connect with protagonist
Apr 24 2022,positive,a great movie  i loved the story and the adventure
Apr 24 2022,negative,not worth watching at home much less paying at a theater poor plot poor acting and overall boring movie
Apr 24 2022,positive,robert eggers norse folkloreinspired tale of glorious savagery is a resounding success as both a visual marvel and a profound character study the score and cinematography are beautifully absorbing and the period detail is outstanding its a brutal uncompromising vision that proves once again that eggers is one of the most gifted filmmakers of our time
Apr 24 2022,negative,i loved the ending of the movie two and a half hours of my life i wont be able to get back i only lost the money i spent on the ticket i feel bad for the studio that wasted 90mil on this clown show the director should be arrested for fraud
Apr 24 2022,positive,good until the ending
Apr 24 2022,positive,great focus on viking mythology and a unique portrayal the plot is easy to follow although the excessive violence becomes tiresome
Apr 24 2022,positive,date night to the movies and wow the northman was a fantastic often bloody and violent roller coaster ride  at times you want to get off but cant wait to get back on  awesome movie
Apr 24 2022,positive,it really draws you in to another world where the myths and lore of the viking world becomes their reality
Apr 24 2022,negative,horrible waste of time and money who ever  wrote the plot must be high stiffing glue
Apr 24 2022,positive,the movie was good however it was long and drawn out
Apr 24 2022,negative,what a strange movieoverall disappointed some cool parts but super weird parts took over
Apr 24 2022,positive,story was excellent it was very good made and almost certainly will watch it again
Apr 24 2022,positive,i think it could have been better
Apr 24 2022,negative,so horrible  just weird  very disappointed
Apr 24 2022,negative,we left the theater about 1 hour into the movie  i found it hard to follow and didnt have a lot of interest in seeing where it was goingif anywhere
Apr 24 2022,positive,the northman isnt for anyone who is looking for an entertaining movie it is a slow story that takes time to finish dont expect a viking movie but a movie based on an individual who is seeking revenge the acting and cinematography is top notch and robert eggers storytelling ability truly shines
Apr 24 2022,negative,wtf did i just watch
Apr 24 2022,negative,piece of crap waste of time indian dance and customs as viking a fraud an insult to viking historical documents people naked in these latitudes no respect for facts pulling hearts like in apocalypto its a joke it seemed like 4 hours long gross and unbearable
Apr 24 2022,positive,performance of nicole kidman joy and skarshard and others were excellent crazy landscapes added to the drama one of alex skarsgards excellent performances the movie provides a window into the viking world that you will not soon forget
Apr 24 2022,negative,not enough dialogue and too dark
Apr 24 2022,positive,i absolutely loved the movie from the symbology to the grittiness it was an excellent film those expecting a netflix like viking movie will probably be disappointed but i thoroughly enjoyed it
Apr 24 2022,negative,terrible in every way receipt cinematically
Apr 24 2022,positive,we loved this movie but no surprise since we were always viking fansskarsgard is perfect as amleth and hes his usual hottie self more alexander please
Apr 24 2022,negative,i dont get the positive reviews for this jumbled up mess of a movie we almost walked out but kept hoping it would get better while we sat there a half dozen people did leave they were the smart ones
Apr 24 2022,positive,phenomenal movie skarsgard fulfilled his role excellently
Apr 24 2022,negative,if you enjoy watching men growling howling and fighting like dogs weird worship rituals and human sacrifices you will like this movie the one star is for the shots of iceland in the background that was pretty cool 
Apr 24 2022,negative,those that say this is a good movie are crazy it looks like a high school play set design is poor acting is poor dialog is worse of all seemed like they took 20 actors and put them in a covid bubble every actor played 5 rolls i think the building had only a front side to see iceland was one of the best places to be during covid so i dont blame the actors for taking the money and a free vacation i would have hoped that the sets actors and battle sceens would have been in the same class as the many current tv shows on the same subject but no way after 15 hours i walked out i was the 3rd to leave not the first
Apr 24 2022,positive,this movie is masterpiece from the visuals to the story an epic viking adventure mixing mystery mysticism and action
Apr 24 2022,negative,i have seen bad movies that looked like they would be good but this was unusually bad i mean i dont even understand how something this tragically flawed could have been recorded and then released without embarrassment
Apr 24 2022,negative,i loved the cast and movies about vikings unfortunately is so slow and boring i had to leave
Apr 24 2022,positive,the northman was a very captivating production it was ascetically pleasing action packed thrilling and overall a fantastic movie within the first ten to twenty minutes the movie was throwing me for a loop with a couple very odd scenes but it quickly grew on me by the end i was immersed completely 1010 will watch again and recommend 
Apr 24 2022,positive,slow drawn out poor effects
Apr 24 2022,positive,a truly revaltory experience unlike anything ive seen before it the cinematography is stunning and the entire journey is beautifully filmed acted and produced  a must see robert eggers is the future of cinema
Apr 24 2022,negative,useless waste of cinematography slow fragmented mostly boring
Apr 24 2022,positive,hamlet the tragedy was based on this story manage your expectations accordingly 
Apr 24 2022,positive,recently ive been reading a whole lot about norse history and mythology and this film just came to me as a gift from the gods   i understood all the references like a undefeated champ  this is eggers take on amleth  the real hamlet    and his thirst for revenge  this time the director tone down the artsy fartsy to tell us a straight forward story that is really simple to fallow  eggers is known as an arthouse director  this film is easily one of the best looking film of the year  every single actor gave us a beautiful performance  delivering us a well crafted film  i loved  loved loved the cinematography and the static of this movie  the soundtrack was mad epic but i feel like they didnt embrace it too much unfortunately i thinks eggers got greedyand i understand man  he wanted to reach a bigger audience so he  compacted a more complex and rich story into a simpler one   into a story  weve seen a thousand fucking times and it kinda felt predictable very  ordinary and old  ordinary like a simpleton  few will understand
Apr 24 2022,negative,a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing
Apr 24 2022,positive,robert eggers masterpiece has finally arrived and it is worth every penny neither the witch nor the lighthouse can prepare you for the show he puts on display here and i say that as a guy who put the lighthouse in his top five favorite movies of 2019 we havent had a brutal beautiful historical epic like this since ridley scotts directors cut of kingdom of heaven while not nearly as broad in scope as those early 2000s sword and sandal films this film makes up for it in its breathtakingly filmed sadistic violence and palpable atmosphere go see it
Apr 24 2022,positive,mythological threads
Apr 24 2022,negative,horrible movie dont waste your time this was a very dark movie seemed like the satan worshipers kind of movie with rituals demons 
Apr 24 2022,negative,ill start with what this movie did well    the protagonist had killer physique and abs    ok on to the lengthy task of everything wrong with it 90 of the movie consists of senseless odd chanting songs rituals and dances that i couldnt understand and dont care about they added no value and werent entertaining they were so cheesy i felt mildly embarassed and uncomfortable and at first thought  ok this is wierd but its just getting started  that continues on for the vast majority of the film there is no context or explanation    there is zero character development past the first 10 minutes we just time skip to a grown man who wants revenge  there is no change or growth  no history or interesting side character addition you can see there are one or two hints  not an exaggeration just one or two of a backstory showing this character has now existed many years     i do not care about any of the characters none of them were likeable i have no idea what their wants  thoughts  feelings  motivations  or struggles are they barely exist as pretty pictures     the combat and choreography are horrid there is maybe one real fight scene that was exciting and felt like it held weight and promise thats it none of it made me care for one side or the other every fight was a one sided piss poor slaughter with no real believable action do not go for good action    acting and dialogue was so bad it doesnt deserve a response  there wasnt much because so little happened in the 25 hours     plot and writing so bad it includes multiple deus ex machina saves  praise the gods    just awful  this is the worst movie ive ever seen and that includes some b movies    this is a covid flop special theyre rolling out to rob the viewers and recoup some losses take my money but give me my 2 hours back this movie truly doesnt have a single redeeming quality there isnt a single thing to like about it im ashamed i didnt get up and leave i had relatives with with and didnt want to embarass them
Apr 24 2022,neutral,i havent seen a movie this dark wet dirty and savage in a while lots of shouting and gruesome fighting paint the viking culture in a very negative light which is not alleviated by the not strictly positive protagonists since the story is adapted from an old patriotic work of danish history it includes divine interventions which does not help make it easier to follow the cast led by alexander not pennywise bill skarsgård contains a number of well known names eg anya taylorjoy willem dafoe and bjork the acting is therefore up to par all in all a film for viking fans but not for everyone including the little ones
Apr 24 2022,negative,it was the most awful movie ive ever seen no real plot no character development huge missed opportunity uhtred from the last kingdom would be very very ashamed we should be paid to watch this movie instead of paying to see it
Apr 24 2022,positive,lots of mythic elements lots if catharsis 45
Apr 24 2022,positive,a little slow to start but it gets going 
Apr 24 2022,neutral,it was a weird movie with lots of pagan and metaphysical overtones
Apr 24 2022,negative,a lot of mud and blood maybe it had a plot i dunno i fell asleep because the gratuitous violence bored me
Apr 24 2022,positive,i liked it it wasnt the best movie
Apr 24 2022,positive,get passed the weird barking in the beginning it turns out to be a decent movie
Apr 24 2022,positive,was not a typical viking movie not bad though
Apr 24 2022,negative,to long and dark and boring 
Apr 24 2022,positive,beautifully shot and fast paced but with minimal story
Apr 23 2022,negative,horrible  best to a watch at home when its free
Apr 23 2022,positive,not what i was expecting for a viking movie  thats not a bad thing its better  that twist in the story i never saw it coming great story
Apr 23 2022,negative,rarely do i rate movies good or bad but a lot of elements in this movie just seemed pointless so many rituals that didnt make sense and dragged the movie out some of the relationships between characters just made you think wtf and wonder why things were that way  overall very disappointing movie
Apr 23 2022,neutral,where was the movie i was promised in the trailers
Apr 23 2022,negative,as if poor writing laborious dialogue bad acting no plot improbable situations vibrating seats loud sound and cgi make a good movie i have not seen such a bad movie since joe and the volcano watching paint dry and taking a nap would have been a better use of time
Apr 23 2022,negative,utter dreck one of the worst movies ive ever seen
Apr 23 2022,negative,bad build up to a storyline
Apr 23 2022,positive,northman exceeded my expectations in every dimension it was not just a generic viking movie about killing but it showed the journey of a boy from anger and revenge to an adult quest for completion the film even had love and showed glimpses of the old norse pagan religion     the ending had many facets and each was perfect its one of those movies that one will see different aspects when seen a second time it was an amazing cinematic treasure this movie earned   10 of 10
Apr 23 2022,positive,the northman is a epic violent and amazing film of 2022
Apr 23 2022,positive,i loved it great story loosely based on the hamlet tale lots of norse mythological references epic historical fiction action a little romance very violent though so if you dont like bloodgore not for you would recommend to actionadventure and history buffs who enjoy epic hero tales and vengeance stories with a moral
Apr 23 2022,negative,total waste of time boring rambling story the violence made no sense i would not watch on netflix and netflix has lots of sub par movies
Apr 23 2022,positive,couldve used some music at the end creditstoo quiet after some tense moments besides that a beautifully done film with a lot of emotion good music and wardrobesets truly a story just like our own about the choices we make our actions and our consequences most of us just dont get bloody fighting our everyday warsif ya get me it delved into spiritual wisdom following your calling and ultimately living deeply true to your beliefs raw gripping took some time afterwards to process it all i think great for those who appreciate the deep spiritual connect of everything in life the openness of the imagination and the raw deep emotions we sometimes unfortunately have to face as humans whew two thumbs up
Apr 23 2022,negative,great cinematography great graphics crap movie poor acting nonexistent storyline no background to characters not even names no fight scenes to speak of only the end which was copied straight out of gladiator historically inaccurate and embarrassing at some points choreographed dancing around the fire and even that was bad very very very disappointed
Apr 23 2022,negative,horrible movie constant killing with no story line
Apr 23 2022,positive,i loved it killer movie going experience this film really stuck with me after leaving the theater
Apr 23 2022,negative,did not hold my interest
Apr 23 2022,negative,super slow moving plot marginal
Apr 23 2022,positive,great movie disappointed in the audience score so far i am guessing the professional critic score is mostly for eggers love but for whatever reason i like it     i am afraid we may never see another one like this again hopefully i am wrong and i havent checked the box office receipts so far however this movie will grow into a stone cold classic but i know business in general
Apr 23 2022,negative,same old story where the son avenges the death of his father  the attempt to make it seem authentic was not convincingand yet bizarre  it appears to be an attempt to cash in on the popularity of vikings and the last kingdom  spent 15 and 2 plus hours  ill never get it back
Apr 23 2022,positive,poor acting and did not live up to expectations
Apr 23 2022,positive,i liked this movie i would recommend it to anyone who likes viking movies the casting was on point the only complaint would be the main protagonists father dies i feel like a more honorable death would suite the character more
Apr 23 2022,positive,its a great movie and people who are giving it one star or less on this app are just mad that its not fast and the furious
Apr 23 2022,negative,lacked any connection to any character or emotion  everyone rather robotic over over acting  just bleh  i went for vikings and nicole and neither saved this waste of time repetitive soundtrack pointless story
Apr 23 2022,negative,i still dont know what i just saw like a poor mans game of thrones but more confusing i thought it would be more magical and fantasy driven the dad burps and his son farts at the beginning of the movie this is cinema beautiful locations but it totally lost me i love nicole kidman but why did she take this role shes good in it but i dont know why this movie was even made good lord im confused   
Apr 23 2022,positive,phenomenal film cinematography is incredible and the accuracy to norse mythology is truly entertaining to those interested this isnt an action movie so dont go in expecting one its a well told epic that takes you through the protagonists journey to the end the story is mostly a backdrop to the incredible art that has been created here
Apr 23 2022,positive,its not bombastic hollywood fare  13th warrior meets hamlet
Apr 23 2022,positive,really awesome movie about vikings definitely deserves the r rating for blood glory and a few sexual scenes its a good epic tale done in the way stories like that used to be with great filming locations and acting this is one of the few allwhite movies made in a long time and i really hope it will not be the last
Apr 23 2022,positive,loved it the story telling cinematography action was on point

Apr 23 2022,negative,wish i could give this a negative score very long and not much of a story line
Apr 23 2022,positive,awesome filmmaking and a great story with a stellar cast definitely see this one also bjork
Apr 23 2022,positive,it was ok it started like a vikings episode then morphed into a viking version of the witch
Apr 23 2022,positive,a welltold medieval tale with excellent acting and breathtaking scenery
Apr 23 2022,negative,nothing special at all  very poor script poor acting and average director great cinematography wait until you can see it for free
Apr 23 2022,positive,good  but a little too straight forward  its brooding in tone but lacked the more consistent etherealdreamlike quality it needed  its there at times just not consistently enough we get brought back to basic reality too often
Apr 23 2022,negative,really dragged along kept hoping that something would happen to spice it up but that never happened a real disappointment considering the talent of the actors
Apr 23 2022,positive,great screenplay cinema photography and great for those that like anything viking did drag for a small portion of the movie but had enough action to please even odin himself
Apr 23 2022,positive,gruesome crazy weird some humor alexander skaarsgard william dafoe and ethan hawke 
Apr 23 2022,negative,probably one of the worst movies i have seen story line was boring effects were cheesy and cheap absolutely horrible movie
Apr 23 2022,positive,i like viking movies and it had a nice twist to it at the end
Apr 23 2022,positive,the ending did not make any sense
Apr 23 2022,positive,watch it on a large screen
Apr 23 2022,positive,the brutality of the viking era is beautifully shot the big screen is necessary to see the cinematography in full swing the single shot fight scenes really brings the visceral barbaric nature of what these people went through the absolute cruelty    i can see why it is not for everyone especially if you are not well versed in viking mythology and history the scenes with willem defoe and bjork are somewhat psychedelic but then berserkers did take hallucinogens before battles so wouldnt be surprising they saw things that werent there adding to their paranoia plus must have contributed to the swelling within amleth to exact revenge to the very end a revenge story that has inspired literature ever since
Apr 23 2022,positive,the story was very good the scenes were awesome
Apr 23 2022,negative,i didnt really see a connection between north mens and the vikings the vikings the ending sucked
Apr 23 2022,positive,enjoyed the movie from beginning to the endvery well acted and filmed
Apr 23 2022,positive,shades of conan the barbarian hamlet the revenant lots of texture courtesy of director robert eggers the ending is perhaps little too clear cut for a film that revels in dramatic imagery but its a great ride along the way
Apr 23 2022,positive,i dont know about north  it seemed to go in all directions  nicole kidmans best work since bmx bandits 
Apr 23 2022,positive,hard to follow but great action scenes and cinematography
Apr 23 2022,negative,one of the worst movies ive seen poor imitation of viking shows available on netflix
Apr 23 2022,positive,i really enjoyed the movie i like how it covered different mythology it shows you how hard it might have been to live during this time period also the acting was really well done also  i would recommend
Apr 23 2022,positive,the gravity of the violence was amazing and what everyone wants to see and the movie flowed for me did not seem long at all
Apr 23 2022,negative,audio was barkcontent brutal and impossible to follow
Apr 23 2022,positive,exciting actionpacked bloody film
Apr 23 2022,positive,it had a good story line but the actual scenes and cinamotography  didnt measure up to the vikings and last kingdom
Apr 23 2022,positive,truly excellent experience   very seldom do i see something that im really glad i saw on the big screen  great performances and a very compelling story
Apr 23 2022,positive,if you love the vikingsvalhalla shows and are into viking loremythologylife then youll love this movie its everything you could want into an actionrevenge movie great acting great story and the visuals are great from landscape to gore
Apr 23 2022,negative,this was such a disappointment it is one of the worst movies the acting was subpar the hype for this movie was nothing like what it was portrayed as dont waste your time or money  the plot was drawn out with some stupid rituals
Apr 23 2022,positive,ending was kind of whack but the story and was great and the acting was on point id definitely recommend it
Apr 23 2022,positive,amazing robert eggers is a genius flawless the best of cinema
Apr 23 2022,positive,amazing movie robert eggers is a genius imo the only explanation for negative reviews is that some people expected it to be like a marvel movie with lots of action a predictable plot and no real substance in reality its beautifully directed with amazing dialogue and cinematography it is somewhat of a slow burn but definitely worth having patience
Apr 23 2022,negative,one of the five worst movies ive ever seen in my 74 years of life husband agrees blood and gore all over the floor plot is insignificant acting is atrocious sounds awful dont waste your money dont see this movie
Apr 23 2022,positive,great cinematography music and atmosphere alexander skarsgard is perfect pacing is a little off but an otherwise enjoyable movie
Apr 23 2022,negative,movie was 3045 minutes too long and the storyline was all over the place do not waste your money on this movie
Apr 23 2022,negative,not great more drama than conquering
Apr 23 2022,positive,im pretty sure the olga on the movie is an ode to olga of kiev which is pretty cool lol looooved the movie btw
Apr 23 2022,positive,absolutely gorgeous cinematography the revenge tale has been done before several times but i likes the viking twist to this one  very brutal and good acting all around
Apr 23 2022,positive,it was outstanding a love song to nordic mythology
Apr 23 2022,positive,movies was freaking amazing and brutally highly recommended
Apr 23 2022,positive,this movie is clean
Apr 23 2022,neutral,weird didnt like the ending but action packed
Apr 23 2022,negative,not worth the effort it took to drive to the theater  as a fan of all things viking this movie was pretty awful
Apr 23 2022,negative,movie was void of feeling and flow was just disappointment after disappointment for a brief moment it began to make a comeback but fell very short 
Apr 23 2022,negative,weirdly done not a fan at all nothing like the viking series you have seen
Apr 23 2022,positive,long and slow not very interesting the fight scenes look too scripted the movie is 2 hours and sixteen minutes long would have need better at 145 minutes or so i actually left with about 25 minutes to go the monotony got too much
Apr 23 2022,negative,while the scenery was beautiful the rest of the movie including anya taylorjoys performance was a great disappointment  too loud too long too dark and the plot was difficult to follow    i am a fan of ms taylorjoy but her acting did not meet my expectations    please do not waste your money
Apr 23 2022,negative,wish i could give this zero what a mess 
Apr 23 2022,positive,freaking awesome
Apr 23 2022,negative,the best part of this movie was the part where the mms are strapped to the bomb and they tell you to silence your phone to be honest if someone had actually taken a call on speakerphone during this movie i would have given it two stars    if youre the person who watches horrible artsiefartsie movies and pretends you are on some higher level of intelligence than everyone else and that everyone else is just too stupid to understand the depth of the filmyoure going to love it
Apr 23 2022,positive,loved the movie definitely work the watch
Apr 23 2022,neutral,great presentation with subpar content you can tell the director is mostly interested in cinematography and getting that perfect artsy shot im not against that but it came at the cost of a less than interesting story to me i wanted to see the main character as he appeared in the beginning with his long hair beard and catching spears throughout the whole movie instead hes partially neutered for much of the story and never really aspires to the heights that would have immortalized him as a movie icon with other greats such as conan rocky or rambo the story was different thats for sure but i dont think it helped it in this instance
Apr 23 2022,positive,the reality of the time period
Apr 23 2022,negative,to say its dark is an understatement
Apr 23 2022,negative,slow movie with no story
Apr 23 2022,negative,one of the worst films ive ever seen all aspects
Apr 23 2022,positive,i mean if they guy really wanted revenge he could have had it at the 45 minutes mark
Apr 23 2022,positive,absolutely incredible to me as a follower of the old ways robert eggers is an amazing filmmaker
Apr 23 2022,positive,this was one hellava ridea great movie from beginning to end
Apr 23 2022,positive,this movie was amazing  the cinematography along with the music and production design was so well done  it might be too gory for some people but if you have watched game of thrones this should be nothing for you  i would rate it a 910
Apr 23 2022,positive,robert eggers proves once again his directorial abilities are methodical deliberate and intricate with an accurate sense for presenting visuals in ways that are deeply absorbing brutal and unfeigned the northman is a masterclass in poetic aggressive ruggedness and a viking epic for the ages alexander skarsgård exudes an incredible brutishness both in feral fight scenes and more pensive often mystic interludes anya taylorjoy is perfect as per usual claes bang presents a layered antagonist via his superb sometimes subtle acting and nicole kidman establishes why she is one of the major acting talents of our times in fact it is quite difficult to find faults in this movie both in acting story and cinematography one could perhaps find the pacing to be uneven at times though i would contest such an assessment by pointing to the grand scale of the movie and its need for more quiet periods it feels quite long but  in and of itself  this is not necessarily problematic the dialogue is heavy and demanding the movie itself is an experience  visually artistically and cinematically an absolute mustsee
Apr 23 2022,positive,loved how accurate to the times and mythology it stays so well done  seen it 3 times so far
Apr 23 2022,positive,cinematic intensity mystical epic stoic awesome
Apr 23 2022,positive,incredible masterpiece    olga  show the shepherd that youre a sheep    amleth  ill show the shepherd his death
Apr 23 2022,positive,great revenge story with phenomenal performances the plot is a little bit predictable if youve seen similar types of movies but the action and atmosphere more than makes up for it
Apr 23 2022,positive,good weird looked great wonderful locations good acting story was a bit hamlety and straightforward revenge tale some terrific action sequences some that looks like one continuous impressive take felt long it was a bit too mystical in spots
Apr 23 2022,negative,kind of disappointing cinematic experience was amazing but there was not much dialogue  and what little dialogue there was it was difficult to understand be prepared for 95 of it to be bloody scenes i expected it but it was a little more extreme than anticipated there where also visions that where created while the director was clearly on shrooms ending as well was very abrupt left the theater saying what the hell  and not in a good way
Apr 23 2022,positive,amazing movie intrigued from beginning to end the score dialogue and visuals were phenomenal i would argue that its eggers best film
Apr 23 2022,positive,it is what it is and does it very well
Apr 23 2022,negative,viking snoozer   little plot lots of gore unbelievable events and mumbling actors the ending did not square with supernatural occurrences  the last kingdom is a masterpiece compared to this and the acting was light years ahead
Apr 23 2022,positive,such a good movie would recommend watching it again
Apr 23 2022,positive,loved it but didnt like the ending
Apr 23 2022,positive,best film ive seen in a long time
Apr 23 2022,positive,so great the visual story telling and authentic tones of this movie really allow us to watch an original movie it has been awhile
Apr 23 2022,negative,greatest warrior on earth catches a huge break when he finds out he only needs to kill a guy on a sheep farm yet cant manage to do it even with help from his magic crow buddies rambo routinely took down whole armies with no magic crow backup needed also dont make out with your mom ya stupid weirdo
Apr 23 2022,negative,waste of time period
Apr 23 2022,positive,it was really good weird but awesome
Apr 23 2022,positive,this film by robert eggers who did the witch and the lighthouse is based on an old scandinavian legend that inspired hamlet when the kind of a fictional 895 kingdom ethan hawke with a bad attempt at an accent is killed by his brother claes bang who is very good in the role his son escapes and vows vengeance on the uncle and that he will return to rescue his mother nicole kidman also a bit out of place here  years later the prince is now alexander skarsgård who was born to play this role he returns to get vengeance which turns out more complicated than he expected the movie is incredibly bloody but very well shot and the look and feel of the film is its strongest asset  some of the dialogue is a bit silly and there are some plot twists that make you groan the film is incredibly bloody with some really well choregraphed fight scenes including the final one on top of an active volcano
Apr 23 2022,negative,this movie is a boring disjointed mess youll find much better in the tv series vikings or the last kingdom or the tony curtis kirk douglas epic  no character has redeeming features and they are so blandly painted you just dont care what happens to them  an utter failure from start to finish not even appearances by willem dafoe or bjork can save it
Apr 23 2022,positive,it wasnt really what they did but how they did it the slower parts were bearable because it gave you the confidence that something amazing or weird or grotesque was always around the corner it must be seen in a movie theater it packs a visual punch that would be fuller by a tv or phone screen
Apr 23 2022,negative,disgusting horrible awful
Apr 23 2022,positive,this movie is one of the greatest films i have seen in a long time it was a mixture of shakespeare and the tv show vikings a blood soaked revenge tale about the acceptance of ones fate i loved it it was everything i wanted coming into it and more skarsgards performance as amleth was enthralling and oscar worthy eggers knocked it out of the park with this one i cant say enough about it and when i try to think about the negatives i simply cant movie of the year
Apr 23 2022,positive,it feels so good to see studios release movies worth watching again
Apr 23 2022,positive,for me as a scandinavian archaeologist and living historian with years of doing research and crafts this eggersmovie was an absolute eye candy and also an correction on what hirst has been doing wrong for years with vikings tvseries listening to historians crafters and archaeologists this movie has the right type of vibe and spirit as written in the icelandic sagas and no braindead dialouge bad screenplay and overly psychotic characters as in vikings the details thats gone into this is fantastic from the outfits to the shields spears and swords to the horses and different styles of architecture and its almost 100 authentic it reminds a lot of the old icelandic hrafnurinn flygur movie from 1984 when it comes to this signatur revenge vibe that are written in so many of the original texts from medieval iceland what i also loved was the attention to detail and the different types of vikings that existed back then namely in fashion differences between eastern vikings swedes rus and more western vikings norwegian icelandic the way the movie starts off with getting the attention of the listener with listen is after how old norse and anglo saxons poems often starts off and a clever way to both get that authentic feel to the movie and storyline and also draw in the viewer i also thought it was interesting to see how they portray the mindset on how the vikings might have thought and built up their practices in everyday life with the occational scenes of mythological beings such as the valkyrie symbolizing a warriors travel to valhalla or the ritualic breaking into an ancient burial mound haugbrót which is mentioned a lot in saga texts and also quite common to see in archaeology after excavating a burial the movie is full of details like this that is recognizable from actual icelandic saga texts such as egills saga or læxdøla saga     the movie is of course not perfect but its definetely a step in the right direction with a higher budget i would like to see what eggers could come up with when portraying scandinavian history     dont pay too much attention to the people that are fans of vikings tvseries giving bad reviews as thats closer to fantasy than reality if you want to see a movie that is closer to an authentic viking saga both aestically and visually but also in spirit seek no further than the northman
Apr 23 2022,negative,to wait two years to go to the movies with such a disappointment everything for it has been and i both enjoyed viking anything in this movie was being on the worst movie ive ever watched it was terrible the acting was beyond ridiculously bad and nicole kidman was even more horrible
Apr 23 2022,positive,epic storyline dialogue sound and videography a truly memorable experience i wish the movie could have gone on forever one of the best movies i have seen in theatres in years dolby cinemas brings the movie to life
Apr 23 2022,negative,the beginning of the movie was good we were intrigued  but it went downhill after about the first half hour too long and too weird for us 2 stars
Apr 23 2022,negative,the commercials show all the good parts  way to much time inbetween action parts  story line hard to follow unless you really really listen and pay close attention  hard to do  it was just a waste of time for most parts of the movie  i could have stayed at home and watched young sheldon and had a better time
Apr 23 2022,negative,this movie was an incredible chore to watch i know im not having a great time at the cinema when im constantly checking my watch its a huge disappointment considering that i consider the lighthouse and the vvitch two of my favorite modern movies eggers dropped the ball here
Apr 23 2022,positive,know going into it that youre seeing  robert eggers movie meaning its not a date movie your date will break up wyou in the first 20 minutes epic in its scale the dialog can be a struggle at times but this movie like all of eggers films is an acquired taste dont walk into it expecting a hollywood blockbuster
Apr 23 2022,positive,epic story epic movie script superb acting superb direction superb photography i thoroughly enjoyed this movie from beginning to the end     warning i know the movie will not be too everyones taste my wife jo said although it held her attention for the whole ovef two hour epic she would not ever want to see it again     the viking battle scenes were very gruesome and the awful scene of women and children one toddler being carried by a smiling viking into a large wooden hut and then doors barricaded shut will haunt me for ages it was torched by the vikings     a story of revenge by a son when he watched his father being murdered by his fathers brother and his mother kidnapped and forced to live and marry him but there is a twist to this story the son had solemnly vowed to kill anyone who committed any crime against his father mother and family     to say more will spoil the drama of the movie     the movie is very dark despite the beautiful scenery shot throughout including a volcano which took center stage at the climax   despite jos misgivings i will have to keep my ten rating this is a first for me     when i told jo i will definitely send it again she said you will go on your own
Apr 23 2022,positive,one hell of an interesting experience
Apr 23 2022,negative,it was pretty disgusting and disappointing very slow and long in my opinion as well
Apr 23 2022,positive,great movie i had a fun time my dad liked it too he did say he got lost every now and then though
Apr 23 2022,negative,it was a dogshit movie
Apr 23 2022,positive,the movie was simply amazing the cinematography was beautiful the orchestra that played in the intense action sequences was phenomenal truly a movie worth watching in the biggest screen your theater offers
Apr 23 2022,negative,we wasted a date night on this movie  we are huge fans of vikings and the last kingdom  however this was neither  i almost left after 10 minutes because nothing made sense  however i kept hoping it would get better  sadly it didnt
Apr 23 2022,negative,save your 25 hours ill never be able to get that time back terrible 
Apr 23 2022,negative,too long and not what i expected i was hoping more along the lines of the viking series he should have come back and won his fathers kingdom
Apr 23 2022,positive,excellent story line outstanding acting filmed in breath taking locations
Apr 23 2022,positive,excellent movie to see it in theaters i recommend 100 what an incredible experience
Apr 23 2022,negative,started off good but they dropped the ball
Apr 23 2022,positive,great movie beautifully shot but buyer beware this is not conan the barbarian its more shakespere
Apr 23 2022,neutral,i love viking period movies but this was exhausting  it had some good moments but man did it drag for me
Apr 23 2022,positive,truly special work with the soundtrack and the cinematography  no wasted performance throughout  visceral and enchanting
Apr 23 2022,negative,one of the worst movies of the year  it had potential but unfortunately it was all over the place  my wife and i decided to walk out one hour into it  another couple walked out 12 before us
Apr 23 2022,positive,idiosyncratic notion a the ancient the melody as old as the rotted drumskins on which its totally been composed robert eggers horrendous fierce and wonderful the northman projects each of the twentytall and fivewide feet of the scandinavian godman alexander skarsgrd to play probably the most epic viking in history in the hamlet story to end all hamlet stories indeed they come from the place that is known for the ice and snow from the 12 pm sun where the natural aquifers stream but most particularly they are eager for the redtacky stuff of retribution sweet outdated skullcrushing throatsputtering retaliation whats more the northman sails on a longship with a bubbling ocean inside it the northman feels as if he is being radiated from another universe in the best possible way what the northmans kind ofdirect content needs is shock hitting as it does each of the similar notes struck by ye bards old danish prince story everything in the northman roars the sea the sky the birds the chests the score noodled out on old nordic instruments by firsttime soundtrackproducers robin carolan and sebastian gainsborough is a percussionweighty cabin burner subbing out mad maxs fireshooting electric guitars with dark icelandic zithers while losing absolutely no part of that equivalent stomachconvulsing skinsinging wrath i genuinely love that now not at all like the 50s when these endeavors were viewed as jokey and modest we live in an overall setting where we can see and value that genuine specialists committed genuine specialty and exertion and enormous expertise into moving us to some other time however toward another totally outsider mentality by and large individuals 1000 quite a while back werent working from similar reference focuses that we underestimate today and an academic movie producer like robert eggers is fundamental in really getting that across we arent watching a valkyrie shriek across the sky for sheer game and exhibition  this was the way amleth and his family accepted how they saw the world whats more the northman goes full gangbusters in its endeavors to pack those old eyeballs into our scoopedout attachments the very best to make us see their direction if by some stroke of good luck for a moment of genuine film ecstasy nirvana come and see everything being equal how to look at an unforgiving eye on top of its singletake artistic exhibition of blood and rage as we watch the vikings attack a small town there are a few shots of the how in the world did he do that assortment that fundamentally request clench hand totable a revisitation of the bigscreen cinema if alright for you to see them writ as extensive as they proffer and wonder as amleth surrounds his dads killer and his shoulders spread huge amounts at a time he slips himself into servitude into foxsly disarray carrier and into some sentiment as well all while the fountain of liquid magma at the skyline develops redder angrier earths most prominent pimple prepared to blow its top in any case its actually communicating in a language one of brimstone and sulfur and cawing radiant birds that feels far off enough from our own that it starts and sizzles with outright creativity with an extravagance most films never come close to the northman in another tongue is unsoiled splendid
Apr 23 2022,negative,this movie was slow moving love story was not believable huge plot holes bad lines
Apr 23 2022,positive,this movie was insane 
Apr 23 2022,positive,movies like this just dont get made anymore very well paced and feels authentic bravo cant wait to see it again on video 
Apr 23 2022,negative,huge disappointment being a fan of the series vikings was looking forward to this but didnt even stay for the end  bad movie
Apr 23 2022,negative,what did i just watch this movie is unintentional hilarious they attempted to remake lion king with vikings in the style of shakespeare and failed catastrophically it feels like a 14 year olds art project and i would give them an f surely they must have realised how bad it was filming it there is no character development a weak story line terrible acting somehow they managed to drag out a cliché revenge story for 2 hours he literally could have killed him 10x over but instead decided to shovel shit for months first save your money and watch moss grow it will be more entertaining i had to create a rotten tomatoes account just to write this review thats how much i hated this movie
Apr 23 2022,positive,robert eggers has given us the definitive viking epic a hard hitting slow burn of a fable set against the classic tale of revenge go see this movie
Apr 23 2022,negative,absolutely terrible not sure what they were attempting but was a total fail seemed very low budget or maybe just poorly made
Apr 23 2022,positive,i will start this off by saying please if you are a fan of film if you are a fan of viking historynorse mythology  go see this now this is the absolute best it gets twelve hours past my showing of this film and i am still completely floored robert eggers starts this ride off with a story that may seem familiar to most of us at the beginning but as we get time to watch this tale unfold it throws us in for some twists  turns along the way to pack in unpredictable moments which lead up to a grand finale the performances across the whole board are phenomenal but i have to mainly applaud the fact that alexander skarsgard finally got this moment to fully shine there are multiple moments that left goosebumps upon me and he made this role his nicole kidman delivers a performance that i personally believe was her best in years another standout in this cast was claes bang whom i was not familiar with his previous work but owned this role and gained a big fan together these three really take hold of this film and it really rested upon their shoulders  they delivered big time the cinematography in this film is a top tier massive standout just to be expected when eggers name is attached to a project at times its almost hypnotic  makes it more of an immersive experience words cant convey how much of a home run this was this is why i go to the movie theater
Apr 23 2022,negative,it was the strangest feeling when the credits rolled the whole audience started laughing and the overwhelming conversation was what did i just watch pretty sure the whole production was on an acid trip
Apr 23 2022,positive,a very well made vinking revenge story with a lot of style beautiful cinematography and amazing acting enjoyable from start to finish definitely a must see
Apr 23 2022,negative,my brother said it looked like a cool movie  should have known he has a nack of picking b movies  one star for setting another for some of the actors horrible direction script plot man not sure if two stars is low enough  left the theater feeling like i wasted hours of life i love the movies and will most anything never do i ever write reviews like this one sorry for all involved in the making will say the historical depiction seemed very history channel which i love would almost give it another star for the grave scenes almost
Apr 23 2022,positive,the way this movie was shot was visually stunning and felt historically accurate cant wait to see it again
Apr 23 2022,positive,loosely based on the scandinavian legend of amleth a viking prince who avenges his fathers death at the hands of his uncle which famously inspired shakespeares hamlet this story is now retold via writerdirector robert eggers meticulous and authentic eye and alexander skarsgards massively chiselled body cowritten with internationally acclaimed icelandic author sjon and shot on location in iceland and northern ireland home of games of thrones its technical production is fantastically immersive and undeniably spectacular eggers proves once again hes a master in dread and foreboding and his film cannot look any more epic and atmospheric with its cinematic compositions making ample use of the vast and harsh landscape thats so drained of colours youd mistaken its shot in monochrome the story itself is fairly straightforward and straightforwardly told with the supernatural injected whenever the narrative needs it to plug certain gaps and theres even one plot turn that some might not see coming individually it has stunning setpieces and scenes that will linger long after the film but as a whole placing them one after another it can feel relentless and exhausting especially accompanied by robin carolan and sebastian gainsboroughs deafening score and i cant help but wish for a little respite or subtlety from its bombastic onslaught of violence body horror and animalistic display of masculinity throughout its 2hrs duration neither is there much acting required from its cast as their main job seems to be delivering the ye olde english dialogue in a multitude of hybrid accents often in shouty mode without crossing into caricatures or worse unintentionally wandering into monty python eggers last film surprised me with its tragic beauty but this one comes across rather onenote and while its certainly very well made id be reluctant to ever put myself through it again
Apr 23 2022,positive,it was a really good movie all around the only thing i wish there would have been more fighting  but good movie nonetheless
Apr 23 2022,positive,costume and locations were fantastic  but the film i could not follow i felt that an opportunity was missed to make an incredible film some decision made by the filmmaker were lets say oddly underwhelming still worth the watch for sure
Apr 23 2022,positive,realistic portrayal of vikings and great character development
Apr 23 2022,positive,i had no idea what i was getting into with the northman but oh boy am i ever glad i saw it its a cinematic masterpiece a career best from robert eggers until now ive only liked eggers other films this was the first that i undoubtedly loved its visceral cerebral and most of all a brutal force of a film i was left speechless when it ended its a truly stunning movie it is technically phenomenal tells a great very shakespearean story and has some incredible performances theres just so many aspects i liked about it and it was one that i didnt think id like never mind love it wasnt the movie i thought it would be and i tended to like it more and more as it went on i feel like it will be a film that really sits with me it was such a welcome surprise    ive heard people say this film is a mix between 300 and midsommar which is true but i think a better comparison is the green knight mixed with the revenant with a little bit of the tragedy of macbeth sprinkled in its an incredible viking revenge tale and so atmospheric and visceral it truly feels like you have time traveled into the world of the movie ive never had an experience quite like it where i was convinced i was watching something made in viking times and i felt like i was there i attribute this to eggers brilliant writing and direction the film is very authentic and stylistically perfect for what it needed to be the stunning production design costuming and even lighting works to create such a strong sense of verisimilitude i especially loved the lighting you could tell everything was lit either naturally or by candletorch to really help sell the world i also loved how eggers made it feel very cerebral too from the use of the lucid dream sequences or the inclusion of norse mythology the writing is also just perfect its excellently layered has great shakespeareanlike dialogue and qualities to it and mixed in are some excellent and insightful thematic explorations on topics like the cycle of violence greed and spiritual journeys the plot while telling a bloody revenge tale was also very nuanced and had some pretty great twists that i didnt see coming there were so many jaw dropping moments in this film whether because of the story a disturbing element or some clever filmmaking    without the technical elements this film wouldnt be as strong i touched on the lack of artificial lighting earlier which helped with authenticity as well as the production design and costuming but what i was most blown away by was the sound design it didnt let up and helped create a sense of rhythm and flow to the film when scenes would transition to the next the epic soundtrack would be there to blend it all into one large sequence the score was so unique and gave the film an unsettling unnerving and as i mentioned cerebral feel i also loved how they placed sounds around the theatre this film used the back channels of surround sound so well to fully encapsulate you in the film making it such a crazy experience the cinematography was also beautiful the film is a visual marvel but i have to admit at times i was so enamoured by the film and felt like i was right in it that i didnt even notice it at times there was an excellently used long take early in the film which was incredible to watch as it took place over a whole brutal and bloody action sequence the use of silhouettes was also really well done especially in the final epic battle i also have to say the locations chosen to film on were remarkably gorgeous i was also surprised at the pacing of the film it moved much faster than i thought it would and was very tightly edited    everything in this film was firing on all cylinders its a true cinematic masterpiece from robert eggers and i havent even touched on the acting yet which was phenomenal alexander skarsgård was a beast here he delivered a performance so animalistic and full of rage unlike anything ive seen anya taylorjoy and nicole kidman were also both excellent all the performances were just perfect but the best part was that you never noticed it you could only ever see the characters and not the people playing them which is great for the movie and tells you everything you need to know about the acting the action was also awesome its quite graphic and gory but has a very epic and gritty sense to it its insanely intense just a perfect piece of work from eggers its his most accessible film to mainstream audiences and i really hope you go out to see it its an experience as close to time travelling to the viking age as you can get im so happy and so surprised i loved this film it just completely stunned me with how visceral and brutal it was not to mention how cinematically excellent it is as a piece of film go see it you havent seen anything quite like it
Apr 23 2022,positive,best viking movie but be aware dont expect action every other scene
Apr 23 2022,negative,the best scenes are in the preview the movie was disappointing
Apr 23 2022,positive,great cinematography coupled with a jarring story with twists and turns that encapsulates the brutality and nobility of viking times
Apr 23 2022,positive,stylish viking saga however theres more in the the style than the substance the movie several times refers to the choice between revenge and kindness but the movie is 98 about revenge
Apr 23 2022,positive,if psychedelia and tragedy had a child this movie would be that child beautiful scenes great acting and a good story kept me at the edge of my seat for the whole duration
Apr 23 2022,negative,i cant remember when i have seen such a terribly made movie
Apr 23 2022,positive,love the mythology that was use love the story   what i didnt like was that there wasnt that much fighting scenes  love the berserker dance
Apr 23 2022,positive,a powerful retelling of hamlet and the destructive power of the search for revenge the end is not lame as described elsewhere but inevitable determined by fate and the only possible resolution entwined with saga mythology and filmed in iceland it is visually stunning and should be seen on the big screen excellent acting adds to the immersive experience you are there
Apr 23 2022,positive,overall a solid movie that sometimes drags in some parts i loved the setting the shots were beautiful and the cast was awesome it was weird violent but beautiful at the same time i personally liked the ending and thought it was fitting to how the movie was going go support this movie
Apr 23 2022,negative,the trailer was excellent the movie not so much 
Apr 23 2022,positive,there are very very few viking movies that are at all good this one was gritty dark and authentic totally badass and epic tale augmented with bjork
Apr 23 2022,positive,this movie kept me on the edge of my seat loved it
Apr 23 2022,positive,the cinematography was amazing the development of character was gravitating delivery of story was intense
Apr 23 2022,positive,a fantastic bloody magical masterpiece of a viking revenge story
Apr 23 2022,positive,this is an absolute beast of a movie it is a revenge fueled visual epic that is hard to top this movie makes braveheart and gladiator look like childs play go see this at the biggest loudest theater you can
Apr 23 2022,positive,its one thing to demonstrate the importance of historical accuracy as a filmmaker but its an entirely differently thing to be able to clearly empathize with it without polluting it with your contemporary zeitgeist     eggers has absolutely won my undying loyalty as a filmmaker     also if you didnt like it youre dumb
Apr 23 2022,positive,awesome pure and simply viking hamlet with some revisions at the end to make one rethink some previous allusions but it doesnt detract from anything
Apr 23 2022,negative,this movie had some decent scenes  overall it is a pretty bland story  very little character development  i didnt feel any type of connection with the characters
Apr 23 2022,negative,started well then went downhill with an anticlimactic ending sorry
Apr 23 2022,positive,a psychedelic trip to the land of the vikings with stunning cinematography and a soundtrack to match the uninvested viewer may lose focus with disjointed pacing and a story that is alltoo straightforward but will be rewarded with a enjoyable spectacle of violence and mysticism that can be enjoyed over and over for the sensory appeal alone 
Apr 23 2022,positive,couldnt take my eyes off the movie so appealing visually review to follow
Apr 23 2022,positive,good movie shows a good bit about norse culture felt the movie was a little rushed as in the movie is 2hr30min long but a lot of jumping happens still recommend
Apr 23 2022,positive,the dialogue can be a bit chunky at times but the emotions action and performances more than make up for it visually stunning gutwrenching emotional scenes and punchyouintheeyeballs fight scenes i absolutely loved it
Apr 23 2022,positive,this is not braveheart most people will not like it because they only understand minions and mdea movies if you like robert eggers other films you will most likely enjoy this one as well if not more like i did
Apr 23 2022,positive,truly an incredible tale that stretches far deeper than a simple revenge plot although simplicity within the story brings balance for a far more general audience to view and enjoy alike
Apr 23 2022,positive,incredible dialogue impactful action and characters develop real relationships direction writing and acting were all spot on
Apr 23 2022,negative,the cinematography and acting are the only redeeming factors
Apr 23 2022,positive,i thought the northman was edgy and kept you on your toes the whole movie will definitely be picking this up when it comes out on bluray
Apr 23 2022,negative,really disappointed thin story line even thinner acting plenty of blood guts literally and fight scenes but a very weak ending not worth the 2 hours
Apr 23 2022,positive,a gorgeous bloody epic about vengeance morals or lack thereof and fate the performances score imagery and cinematography make this a must see
Apr 23 2022,positive,a lot of you regulars wont enjoy this but after some cinema research you might learn to appreciate lol 
Apr 23 2022,neutral,viking hamlet without the social commentary or discussion of the moral implications of revenge the directing and acting is great particularly nicole kidman who crushes it in the once scene in which shes given more than two lines if youre looking for a wellresearched historically accurate account of the brutality of viking life its worth a shot but if you want a violent norse epic with actual heart youre better off playing god of war
Apr 23 2022,positive,great movie eggers penchant for grit and realism really makes this film come to life visually interesting but a little predictable id recommend this in the theaters tell your date it is a dark romantic comedy and apologize afterward
Apr 23 2022,negative,poor acting poor script poor ending  a few good fight scenes that were very violent but relied on gross graphic shots to be more shocking and over the top    really stupid over dramatic pagan scenes  not believable at all  a comic strip is more believable
Apr 23 2022,negative,by far the worst movie ive ever seen it was so bad that it was actually funny
Apr 23 2022,negative,very slow and a lot of confusioni get the mythological aspects of it but it went to far down the rabbit hole its a viking revenge movie but you get more of a graveling mess by the time the good killing really starts youre wanting to leave the theaterthe movie just dragsits two hours of a whole lot of unnecessary content
Apr 23 2022,positive,i was worried this would take an indiefolklore take like the green knight but was pleasantly surprised the action fulfilled expectations plot dipped in luster at times but i feel they achieved their goal 
Apr 23 2022,positive,this is a masterpiece what a movie i adore this entire movie from start to finish id pay to watch it again original and worth it incredible cast sooo sooo intense dark and crazy cool visuals best movie honestly of the year it deserves awards bravo
Apr 23 2022,positive,very tense brutal unforgiving i sorta feel more stunned than anything in a good way great performances
Apr 23 2022,neutral,i went to see northman with my brother with high expectations  disappointed  i watched every episode of the last kingdom and loved it   northman had some awesome scenes  ready to deliver  then the artsy bizarro viking spiritual stuff was just out there and ruined the momentum  this movie had such potential  it could have been great  so much talent and the viking world is rich  the ending disappointed  overall i would not see it again or recommend
Apr 23 2022,positive,great movie like 300 and the revenant mixed together except vikings very action packed a lot of spiritual and religious meanings throughout the movie very good will watch again
Apr 23 2022,negative,twas awful  truly awful  as one other reviewer said the best parts were the mystical sections  not because they were good but because they made everyone laugh  alas that was not the directors intent  any positive review here is either fake or written by someone who values soso visuals over a terrible plot terrible dialogue and terrible acting  trust me save yourself 14 and 3 hours
Apr 23 2022,positive,a refreshing perspective and style on the classic tale
Apr 23 2022,positive,i will avenge you father i will save you mother and i will kill you fjölnir    robert eggerss third feature and this time its a big budget revenge fantasy similar to the previous two this one retained most of the a24 vibe look and dreadful atmosphere the cinematography and music for the most part were amazing as expected there wasnt as much disturbing visuals as i wanted but i still liked what i got     the story itself showcased incredible amount of toxic masculinity men were literally acting like wild animals and showing muscles its like the a24 version of 300 also there was another theme of fate which i had a bit of an issue with    but maybe its because of the studio interference but there were a couple of scenes and pacing issues especially near the beginning this got me a bit confused at the motives of some of the characters taylorjoys character was pretty confusing too the mythology behind the movie although not as complicated as in the lighthouse still was a bit much for me    overall i still enjoyed the movie a lot despite some of its problems 8510
Apr 23 2022,positive,great movie the film was very well adapted to the history without losing any magic vikings blood fights betrayals etc
Apr 23 2022,positive,nice revenge story a must see
Apr 23 2022,positive,one of the best films i have ever seen if people dont like norse mythology i can see why they are confused by some spiritual momentsscenes its a gritty harsh world and thats shown to the maximum if you didnt take revenge back then you would be shamed in society too many people expected to go and see marvel film thor sadly and dont know what a berserker   is    if people only know anything from the viking period from amazon vikings show vikings valhalla or last kingdom you probably wont like this most historical correct take
Apr 23 2022,negative,not since the island of dr moreau have i actually laughed at a movie out loud because it was so stupid 2 stars because it made me laugh out loud some memorable scenes are  the kid jumping on skargards back stabbing him like chucky skargard jumping out of a boat like forrest gump when he saw lt dan 2 grown men fighting naked beside a volcano skargard and kid drinking out of a dog bowl together wow is all i can say
Apr 23 2022,negative,cool but a little dry very dry
Apr 23 2022,positive,really great movie there was some really amazing shots and the costume design was awesome the fight scenes were well done the plot and story were pretty much just your basic revenge stuff but over all very enjoyable
Apr 23 2022,positive,trailer was way better than the actual movie
Apr 23 2022,negative,i would give this movie a lower score if possible made absolutely no sense just a hodge podge of a mess
Apr 23 2022,positive,arguably the best movie i have ever seen
Apr 23 2022,positive,i love the movie action pack with the intenson storyline
Apr 23 2022,positive,not what i was expecting not bad but wouldnt watch it again lol wouldve been better as a series
Apr 23 2022,negative,poorly written ventured from plot into the ridiculous substandard acting and the directing was even worse its 3 hours of my life ill never get back
Apr 23 2022,positive,this movie is amazing  the visuals  the cinematography  the story all a
Apr 23 2022,negative,it lacked so much its hard to explain
Apr 23 2022,positive,it was made to be an epic but falls a bit short still a good film though
Apr 23 2022,positive,cool movie way more supernatural than i expected and thats not a bad thing maybe one of the loudest movies ive ever seen in the theaters as well hey fandango are you waiting for watching push the exit door to the theater everytime you ask for a review 
Apr 23 2022,positive,northman is a really mixed bag great casting with some truly awe inspiring visuals but a dreadful noise of a soundtrack gave me a migraine 10 minutes in the mysticism is a bit over the top and both bloats the runtime and kills the pace of the first half of the film every once in a while some comically bad cgi rears its ugly heads  3 stars out of 5  for me but my guess is people will be all over the map on this one 1 to 5
Apr 23 2022,positive,i love the cinema and this was magnificent highly recommend on the big screen  great landscapes and look into norse culture  the magic mushrooming scenes are epic 
Apr 23 2022,positive,the vision the direction and pace of the film flows naturally robert eggers wove a tale that had you feeling for amleth while laying the pieces for the culmination of the story a good balance of character interaction and actionpacked sequences for all moviegoers a period film with attention to detail that incorporates various elements of norse mythology with some creative license a viking classic
Apr 23 2022,positive,unbelievably epic eggers best work yet
Apr 23 2022,positive,a familiar revenge tale wrapped in a bloodsoaked visual feast
Apr 23 2022,negative,its simultaneously the worst movie and the best comedy i have ever seen i give it a perfect 55 in comedy it is so bad it enters into the legendary pantheon of cult classic movies like the room this is a masterpiece
Apr 23 2022,positive,the visualshard to understand all the dialogue but awesome
Apr 23 2022,negative,movie was too long for such a poor ending 
Apr 23 2022,positive,lengthy but  well done
Apr 23 2022,negative,walked out after a little over an hour waste of money  time
Apr 23 2022,negative,cinematography was beautiful but the plot was predictable
Apr 23 2022,positive,i enjoyed the plot in its entirety the way he avenged the death of his father and trying to save his mother it was all very attention grabbing
Apr 23 2022,positive,if you arent ready to understand that this film isnt a revenge story trope but rather the original revenge story from which shakespeare down to the lion king drew inspiration stay home  if youre looking for cheap tv action go rewatch vikings or the last kingdom     for everyone else get ready for one of the most visually and technically interesting films youve ever seen  not for the faint of heart and certainly not for the dull of mind  this isnt just some action movie 
Apr 23 2022,positive,like his memorable period piece freakouts the witch and the lighthouse though on a vastly more ambitious scale bloody and deliciously violent the northman is a bigbudget epic but it retains those indie roots and in  robert eggers  fashion  very aesthetically pleasing this film delivers  powerhouse performances and otherworldly imagery  i highly recommend at some point to see this bloodsoaked odyssey  sooner rather than later a cinematic saga the cast in this one is absolutely incredible check out the cast  the northman starring alexander skarsgard anya taylorjoy nicole kidman ethan hawke willem dafoe and björk
Apr 23 2022,positive,did not like the ending
Apr 23 2022,positive,theres never been a film like this ever made an unapologetic look at the seriousness of the culture that was barbaric and brutal to protect its people a legend told without a filter
Apr 23 2022,positive,this film is dark intense visceral and uncompromising not a movie for the kids this is a realistic gritty film with a mostly realistic approach to the mythological aspects its a tragic story of a violent time where you cant completely root for anybody other than some of the slaves just trying to live their lives
Apr 23 2022,positive,its beautiful and brutal its a masterpiece revenge never felt so much better this is beyond amazing its a transcendent experience watch it now robert eggers delivers his signature style and substance without sacrificing the compelling heart at the core of this movie the performances are super super super good the direction and the cinematography are stunning and captivating this movie is what i wish more blockbusters were artsy compelling thoughtprovoking and uncompromising
Apr 23 2022,positive,buff naked sword fight in a volcano
Apr 23 2022,neutral,dark bloody pagan im a big fan of scandinavian lore and history but this was an excruciatingly long drawn out film
Apr 23 2022,positive,great viking revenge film robert eggers is really a very unique and great visual story teller alexander skarsgárd as amleth was a beast
Apr 23 2022,negative,one of the worst movies ive ever seen the acting was horrible which is a shame because it was a waste of big name talent and the plot just dragged on save yourself and watch another movie
Apr 23 2022,negative,my neck and back still ache from watching alexander scarsgaard walk through the whole movie never standing upright i feel like the director tried too hard to be artsy with his weird pagan and witchy imagery and dream sequences that the storyline never stood a chance he had a huge chance to make a braveheart type film and failed miserably
Apr 23 2022,negative,went opening night but didnt make it all the way to the end im a big vikings tv fan  love the genre  so i wanted to like this movie but to me it was horrible it was just weird it felt disjointed and even lazy really bad movie
Apr 23 2022,positive,definitely a must watch if you understand the viking era dialogue was hard to understand at times
Apr 23 2022,positive,fantastic from start to finish robert has done it again worth every bit of your time i hope this movie makes a epic shit ton of money
Apr 23 2022,positive,a story youve probably seen at some point before done masterfully truly a tense nail biting experience from start to finish great acting and directing from robert eggers
Apr 23 2022,positive,dark epic viking warfare the acting story and cinematography are outstanding
Apr 23 2022,negative,the northman has to be the worst movie ive seen in a theater in 20 years its wayyy too long the script is absurd and the climactic scene is an insult to our intelligenceneedless to say i hated it
Apr 23 2022,positive,best movie in a long time  very well written
Apr 23 2022,negative,one of the worst movies i have ever seen im sure it is historically accurate but it lacked any real depth i didnt care what happened to the characters was mostly bored out of my mind and could not wait to get out of the theater i dont know why this movie is getting good reviews from critics
Apr 23 2022,positive,brutal bloody and beautifulthis tale engrossed in viking mythology delivers
Apr 23 2022,positive,this is not for general audiences but for fans of braveheart will love the st out of this
Apr 23 2022,negative,if you are in to that north mythology than it shows it i enjoyed the last kingdom way more than this movie too graphic gore i thought it was more about the warrior side i give it a 65 not worth going to the movies for it
Apr 23 2022,negative,save your money im so anxious to get back to the movies but is not the one to try my quick take trailer had all the good scenes all of them dialogue is muddy zero character development so you dont care who dies feels like a swedishindie conan movie that doesnt work will give it one positive  the scenes of the iceland countryside are really good save money and watch iceland nature videos on the discovery channel  conan the barbarian
Apr 23 2022,negative,total bloodbath from start to finish  the scenery which wasnt shown frequently was the only good thing in the movie
Apr 23 2022,positive,my second favorite film of the year
Apr 23 2022,positive,it was decent and sexy not a very pleasant movie to watch but it had its uniqueness
Apr 23 2022,negative,the movie ended and i looked at the screen and thought what did i just sit through this movie was so unsatisfying that i have a need to go home to watch vikings the last kingdom or valhalla to make up for it what was willem dafoe thinking it left me dumb founded unable to articulate all of the ways in which it failed i am sad dissatisfied and longing for a way to recover from my heartbreak
Apr 23 2022,negative,i hated this movie so much i didnt know much about it going in  but i really couldnt wait for it to be over it was too long too many drawn out scenes and a storyline that had potential but fell flat maybe im spoiled by vikings and the last  kingdom  but northman was so not good
Apr 23 2022,neutral,the witchcraft ruined it
Apr 23 2022,negative,wasnt good at all couldve been lot better especially with the budget they had
Apr 23 2022,positive,leave it up to robert eggers to deliver a goddamn masterpiece whenever he releases a movie he started in 2015 with the witch and got even better in 2019 with the lighthouse and now in 2022 hes at his absolute best yet with the northman first of all as to be expected with any robert eggers film the northman is visually stunning with out of this world cinematography brilliant one take fight scenes and gorgeous cgi affects it is so wellshot that i sat staring in awe throughout the movie secondly the fight scenes are astounding gripping graphically violent and intense they are so well shot and often limited to 1 shot this creates such an awesome way to pull the audience into the scene when there are no cuts in it its bloody but not overly bloody to the point where i can say its the bloodiest thing ever however its gory as hell someone gets their head lopped off every 2 seconds super brutal the sound affects of squishing cracking and swords banging make for one hell of a ride the storytelling is superb here as well eggers writes such an excellent tale of revenge and incorporates excellent emotion in it as well not to mention the amazing plot twist in the middle of the film all of this excels in leading up to an ending that is so satisfying the cast is outstanding as well alexander skarsgård delivers a career best performance hes badass and also interesting at the same time amleth has become one of my favorite movie characters ever after one viewing i can say that with confidence anya taylor joy is excellent as olga she accents skarsgårds brute force with a more sensitive side and brings out the best from them both nicole kidman was excellent as well definitely one of her best performances ive seen so layered the northman is truly something special at this point in time its my favorite movie of 2022 there are few movies i consider to be perfect but the northman has now entered that list robert eggers has become one of my favorite directors working right now and this is his masterpiece    the northman grade a  best of the year
Apr 23 2022,positive,phenomenal performances with amazing direction and cinematography
Apr 23 2022,negative,one of the worst movies i have ever seen
Apr 23 2022,neutral,the trailer was more exciting than the movie   just too many long drawnout scenes and too little plot advancement    eventually i just didnt care about the characters   i was also not the only one yawning in the theater
Apr 23 2022,negative,not much of a story very boring walked out 
Apr 23 2022,negative,short on plot  did not enjoy it
Apr 23 2022,negative,slow starter not a lot of action
Apr 23 2022,positive,a lot of people are not going to like this movie as its not a big spectacle popcorn movie rather it feels like i noir revenge story with vikings and a bit of norse theology imagery   its artsy and thought provoking but when there is action  its viking john wick you have to see it for yourself  i will be watch this movie than once
Apr 23 2022,positive,brutal and unrelenting just like a viking movie should be
Apr 23 2022,negative,horrible movie dont waste your money or time i cant believe we sat through it i should have followed everyone else when they walked out
Apr 23 2022,positive,a one of a kind original film that is truly a masterpiece expectedly getting reviews lower than it deserves by people who dont understand the nature of the film robert eggers is now 3 for 3 and one of the best directors working today
Apr 23 2022,negative,the lighthouse is a masterpiece eggers is a great director so i wanted to love this movie but my god was i disappointed the acting was decent but the story was a mix of lion king and gladiator but with vikings which would be wonderful if it worked but in my opinion it did not very predictable oddly paced with moments of comedy that seemed completely out of place the comedic moments in the lighthouse somehow added to the surreal dread but the ones in the the northman it felt like id been dropped into a marvel movie just really dumb again i wanted to love this movie i am sad to say i did not
Apr 23 2022,negative,one of the worst movies ive ever seen so dumb and boring
Apr 23 2022,positive,my goodness what a great movie
Apr 23 2022,positive,once you remember this is period accurate its brilliant you can tell in every scene that the director  team took the time to do their research the each actor did an amazing job and the cinema photography was gorgeous i wasnt let down in the slightest
Apr 23 2022,negative,hard to understand the spoken words
Apr 23 2022,positive,movie was ok not much of a plot just a lot of sword fighting and other action if you like that sort of thing you may like it
Apr 23 2022,negative,not my kind of movie i thought it was more of conan type of movie dont take your child to watch
Apr 23 2022,positive,great story of revenge love and norse mythology almost perfect some plot holes and maybe a little bit too long but overall very good
Apr 23 2022,negative,the story line was too predictable  couldnt understand  alot of the lines  this movie had alot of potential but i think the writers tried to hard  the ending was stupidtwo men fighting naked on a volcanowouldnt the suffer alone kill them both not mention the heat this movie had too many loose ends the action was ok but so predictable  this is a netflix or streaming movie at best
Apr 23 2022,positive,if youre looking for a gorey viking movie this will do the trick some weird spiritual stuff as well explaining what valhalla is
Apr 23 2022,neutral,i was expecting a better
Apr 23 2022,positive,was dark gritty and a amazing bad ass ending
Apr 23 2022,positive,a lot of violence and nudity

Apr 23 2022,positive,very grim but a great movie
Apr 23 2022,positive,the northman is a visually stunning cinematic experience but there was a better film left in the editing room viking epic is more toothless as a result of studio interference
Apr 23 2022,neutral,i liked the movie but thought it lacked cohesion
Apr 23 2022,negative,grunt chant scream dance bloody ritual repeat too much of that and not enough character development or dialog and a very simple story concept left me underwhelmed
Apr 23 2022,positive,the movie was truly amazing alexander skarsgard really got into his role he was an absolute beast on the screen and anna teller joy her performance was good nicole kidman performance was good as well and for a little bit of time that he had ethan hawke definitely hold his arms and a cinematography absolutely beautiful
Apr 23 2022,negative,unremitting gratuitous violence  gross
Apr 23 2022,negative,really poor movie wanted to leave in middle but stuck around hoping for improvement  left theater wondering  what who why am still hours later asking why to certain scenes
Apr 23 2022,positive,this isnt a typical film its a close look at a cultural mythtale from the 800s done about as realistically as it could be done  grimy gritty savage  sometimes the dialogue is hard to understand because they mutter a lot like a highly tribal culture might but the human behavior all based in violence revenge and savagery are right on target  from that perspective i thought the film did exactly what it set out to do  recreate a period of cultural thats too often over romanticized for the sake of coaxing audiences to sit through two hours of film  visually i found it stunning because theres nothing like a normal costume drama going on here this is basic living at its rawest and the powerful emotions of the revenge motive of the film are clear to understand  so is the confusion of our northman when he finds out things he saw early in his life were not exactly what they seemed and there will be no true satisfaction in revenge but there is a lot of revenge death and belief that some things are worth dying for its also clear to see why this would be a great motivation to rewrite the tale during the late 16th century by cleaning it up for a renaissance audience  authors write what they know and some motivations and behaviors didnt change a lot between the 800s and between 1599 and 1601 when hamlet was written and became a hit they still havent  the need for revenge no matter how twisted or misunderstood still drives humans as does perspective  it still happens today  if you can get past the wild man pagan atmosphere and setting of the tale and move past assumptions of how tv paints various pictures of the past this film is important and realistic in a way seldom seen in entertainment its not for everyone but i enjoyed it very because the attention to detail and the cultural recreation throughout that make up the whole are like a journey back in time they did their homework and it shows  and you cant very well top the two images of a screaming valkyrie on her warhorse carrying a warrior or two towards the gates of valhalla even though at one point it looks like shes wearing braces  still need to figure that out
Apr 23 2022,negative,this movie was horrible  i cannot believe anyone on here liked it  do yourself a favor and dont waste your time or money
Apr 23 2022,positive,brutal visually stunning great acting
Apr 23 2022,negative,one of the worst movies i have seen the plot was all over the place and the timelines made no sense how long was he gone he looked 40 but his mom didnt look 70 the king had a grey beard and looked old and tired and the son was like 12 but now he is how old where has he been who are the people he is with they show one raid he goes on and we are just supposed to assume he is this great warrior the raid including burning children to death as well this made him a very unlikeable character from he start   all he had to do was change shirts and no one recognized him on the slave ship all the other slaves looked like poor villagers except him he was huge and muscular and obviously stood out this made no sense at all his own mom didnt even recognize him     the accents were awful and again made no sense they were in iceland but everyone had british accents and one woman even sounded scottish not one of the characters sounded like a viking from any other movie or show i have seen unless the vikings were all british and i just didnt know it     this movie jumped around all over the place had really dumb plot points and they had no character depth whatsoever it was hard to decide if you liked the characters or not wait for this to come out on a streaming service and then dont watch it i dont know what all of these professional critics are talking about either this movie sucks i love violence i love fighting i love viking movies and shows this just flat out sucked i think nicole kidman owes me 1250 and an apology
Apr 23 2022,negative,one episode of the last kingdom was more enjoyable than this movie just disappointed
Apr 23 2022,positive,incredible alexander skarsgard was insane i recommend it for sure 910
Apr 23 2022,negative,its like a two hour proud boys masturbation fantasy plot is poorly constructed and i dont care about any of the characters i couldnt tell you one of their name
Apr 23 2022,negative,it was pretty boring ngl there was alot of boring scenes
Apr 23 2022,positive,very astonishing visuals action characters and world building
Apr 23 2022,positive,with insane performances and gorgeous imagery robert eggerss intense exploration of revenge and its cost delivers almost every step of the way
Apr 23 2022,positive,it was kind of hard to get into and not what i was expecting
Apr 23 2022,positive,great performance great cinematography great score
Apr 23 2022,negative,0 stars  would give a negative 15 since is was a waste of 15 bucks dumpster fire extraordinaire can understand ethan hawke in this crapfest but nicole kidman and willem dafoe shameful youve been warned
Apr 23 2022,negative,just an awful film it has a great cast but looked like a low budget movie i give it 1 star because the singing and chanting was better than the script
Apr 23 2022,positive,a disjointed story  relies too much on shock value and over the top violence to make up for a weak storyline unmemorable characters and somewhat incomprehensible dialogue   on the plus side there was a lot of good cinematography intense acting and historical realism  the religious rituals portrayed a raw dark age spirit that was probably very close to the real thing  i like the movie overall but i wouldnt go see it again  once was enough
Apr 23 2022,negative,im a big fan of viking lot  shows i got excited to see a movie about northman completely not what i was expecting took a while to even decipher a story the plot  outcome was a give away almost immediately unfortunately im not a fan of the movie
Apr 23 2022,neutral,not actually what i expected i love viking movie however to much witchcraft and unnecessary drama and killings
Apr 23 2022,positive,a masterpiece viking stuff had me clenching my teeth genuinely mind blowing
Apr 23 2022,positive,i liked that it was unique and not like the typical vikings movies  the story was moving and psychological  there is nothing i didnt like
Apr 23 2022,negative,this movie is horrible complete disappointment  i walk out  i couldnt take it anymore no action i fell asleep    complete disaster
Apr 23 2022,negative,super disappointed in this movie no connection or depth between characters lame effects poor acting hard to follow and hard to understand what people were saying movie was just overall bad double thumbs down and a d rating 
Apr 23 2022,positive,fantastic performances all around violent and bloody alexander skarsgard anya taylorjoy and nicole kidman were incredible alexander as amleth the prince hellbent on vengeance nicole the icy queen gudrun anya as the mysterious olga of the birch forrest a rus slavic witch nicole and amya may have small roles but they absolutely stole the show the movie delves deep into both viking myth and history but also touches on the russian myth and history of the first tsar
Apr 23 2022,negative,this was a terrible movie the plot was awful the barking and howling stuff was ridiculous and awful the acting was so bad i love viking shows and movies ajd the previews looked great but this was a really really bad movie the time line makes no sense the plot maies even less sense it seems like it would brother kills brother son wants revenge easy enough but this was just too easy he just happens to raid a village that is taking slaves to his uncles secret farm since he isnt the king because there is a different king he literally only raids one village he also just changes shirts and no one recognizes him anymore he doesnt stand out just a little to any one  i dont know how anyone gave it any stars i want a refund from nicole kidman and an apology
Apr 23 2022,negative,great actors weak storyline way too violent  sorry we spent all that money
Apr 23 2022,neutral,it was a meladrama love story revenge   some action    not what i had hope for  most of the action was in the previews
Apr 23 2022,positive,a brutal exhilarating and breathtaking spectacle the northman adds another wellcrafted film to robert eggers catalog thats vastly different from his previous films while still retaining his trademark directing style
Apr 23 2022,negative,very boring thought it would be more like the vikings not close would not view again
Apr 23 2022,negative,what a waste of time
Apr 23 2022,positive,this movie had all the elements and action a viking movie should have
Apr 22 2022,neutral,the trailer should win an oscar but the movie was a completely different story
Apr 22 2022,positive,best movie of 2022 hands down one of alexander skarsgards best performances
Apr 22 2022,positive,love norse mythology  hope there is a second about the children
Apr 22 2022,negative,i big nothing burger 
Apr 22 2022,negative,a big gladiator nothing burger
Apr 22 2022,positive,seriously one of the best films of the decade staple in evers career
Apr 22 2022,negative,awful simply awful movie
Apr 22 2022,positive,good movie lots of action and a nice twist at the end
Apr 22 2022,positive,wow eggers once again proves himself a master of blending visceral realism with just a touch of mythicality like his previous films this is not for everyone it is grotesquely violent has some truly bizarre scenes and is largely gray and dreary and its the most beautiful gray dreary film ive ever seen the music the cinematography the accents and dialects  and frankly every aspect played their parts to perfection gestalting into an intense and wellpaced film that for my money is eggers best so far
Apr 22 2022,negative,the movie is nothing like the previews it starts off with a very weird animalistic ritual that was extremely silly and misplaced for the time period and continues with a vikingish style story with all these mystic turns it was probably the worst movie i have started to watch and i left at about 45 minutes in this was very disappointing with the amazing cast and the previews made it look like an interesting movie but the plot whatever it was made no sense neither did the mystic elements
Apr 22 2022,positive,was a little bloody and not sure some will like that over all i thought it was good entrainment
Apr 22 2022,positive,good action story line could have been little better
Apr 22 2022,positive,nearly flawless epic revenge viking film
Apr 22 2022,positive,very engaging movie the cast is top notch amazing cinematography skaarsgard is very intense and a great action star anna taylor joy is radiant as well movie has some braveheart vibes a great theatrical experience 
Apr 22 2022,positive,it was good with beer and popcorn
Apr 22 2022,positive,look excellent score top notch performances stellar
Apr 22 2022,positive,the northman is spectacular rousing and brutal 1010 this is art 
Apr 22 2022,positive,the story and acting were great but the movie was very bloody
Apr 22 2022,positive,i see where the director was going it reminded me of noah with russell crowe as far as the cinematography and style it was very raw and not glamorized as hollywood tends to do to movies rotten teeth violence and all which perhaps was how it was back then which i appreciated  nothing pretty about this except olga i thought she was uniquely gorgeous alex was great every one was great i gave it 35 stars bc i didnt overly enjoy it but i really appreciated the honesty it brought the storyline was fine and had a little plot twist but something kept me from connecting to this story maybe someone else would love it
Apr 22 2022,negative,a mess of a story  an inferior vikings wannabe
Apr 22 2022,negative,worst  movie ever thin plot fragmented script
Apr 22 2022,positive,this film the northman depicted the life at that time just as we imaginedbrutal interesting cast who did it justice but we never would have expected nicole and anya to be so opengood acting
Apr 22 2022,negative,the sagas are told in a terse style the movie could not decide if it was opening out these stories or a dramatic representation of the saga itself with all the mythological bits the accents were    very honest about the filth of the times and lots of death destruction and mud it felt like a tryout video game i almost left but stuck it to the end
Apr 22 2022,positive,a tad slow at parts but the cinematography was outstanding and the action was brutal and delicious  a true epic  455
Apr 22 2022,positive,great photography lots of violence story line was good along with the acting
Apr 22 2022,negative,terrible cinematic trash  poor acting very fake accents  should of left during the barking of the father and son  only reason i gave it one star is the sound effects and creepy music
Apr 22 2022,negative,slow hard to follow unspectacular
Apr 22 2022,negative,the dialogue and acting were laughable
Apr 22 2022,positive,i am not one for a story of pure gratuity and human suffering if you are this is a movie for you however it is a geographically gorgeous piece of art i want to thank robert eggers for shooting on wonderful celluloid
Apr 22 2022,positive,i went because of the connection to shakespeares hamlet and had read about the movie and the saxe grammaticus story  i could have done without the soundtrack however which  blotted out some of the dialog  which was pretty hard to understand anyway along with all those beastly sounds uttered by the actors  as they proceeded to kill each other in the most beastly ways possible  it was just too much distraction and i kept losing the thread of the story  and trying to keep the characters clear   i have read about the early norse or viking belief system and caught on to some of the symbolism but again the background noise was distracting and superfluous  the acting was good but of course was restricted to the confines of the direction  the location in iceland was very dramatic and had some scenes of great beauty
Apr 22 2022,positive,its a great film wholly accessible and investing if one can surrender themselves to it and just immerse themselves in its time and place bloody and brutal but with some moving emotional undercurrents and some mysticism thrown in 4 12 stars wouldve liked for it to be longer
Apr 22 2022,positive,i thought this movie was pretty damn good caught me off on guard great ending
Apr 22 2022,positive,the movie was real good liked the story line scenery and of course alexander skarsgard was terrific  i would recommend to anyone but guys will really like it
Apr 22 2022,positive,this is by far and away eggars best film to date not only is it undoubtedly the best viking film but comes off as an instant cinematic masterpiece classic film oscar worthy in all ways
Apr 22 2022,negative,the decision to make this film was courageous technically and performancewise it is superb  however its not particularly enjoyable  the trailer is misleading because its not an adventure  the story is an adaptation of viking tale that forms the core of hamlet  the film has a fable quality because the protagonist is not someone admirable or a rolemodel  his name means insane in old norse and his drive for revenge pretty much sums up his character  this is a brutal dark and cold story where reality and myth are intermingled  the setting characters and tragic nature of the plot is more shakespearean than the bard  without the meaningful language  it is at times incoherent due to the actors drowning their dialogue in overdeveloped accents  the critics have given it a high rating like art aficionados admiring a technically perfect painting which otherwise evokes a limited emotional response from the average person
Apr 22 2022,negative,it was way too long i had trouble understanding what the characters were saying because their fake accents were so bad i thought it was a straight revenge movie but it turned out to be mystical and spiritual and all that stuff i wasnt expecting for animal lovers like me be warned dogs and horses get killed 
Apr 22 2022,positive,ive not watched any of robert eggers previous films but i have certainly enjoyed a bloodsoaked swords  revenge saga or two in my day so the trailer for the northman was always going to catch my attention    reading a little more about it  that it was based on the same ancient tale that inspired hamlet and eggers claims that it would be the most accurate depiction of vikings seen on screen  got me even more enthused     and im glad it did i thoroughly enjoyed this film it had all the blood and revenge i hoped for a sense of very real grandeur fascinating depictions of viking mysticism and excellent performances by all involved and it finished off with a fight to the death by the rivers of lava flowing from an active volcano that put revenge of the sith to shame    highly recommended please go and see this movie because its hard to see how it can possibly recoup its notinsignificant budget and it deserves to be a success
Apr 22 2022,negative,from a cinematography perspective it was great  the plot was predictable and slow  if i had it to do over i would save my money and wait until it goes to video
Apr 22 2022,positive,to see or not to see  i can only attempt to answer that question by saying that the northman was one of the most rewarding visual spectacles ive seen on the big screen in years  shot in ireland the landscapes are utterly astonishing  a true feast for the eyes  it was a shame that the picture was slightly out of focus much like facebooks compression of this poster art for the duration of its runtime though i couldnt pull myself away to complain about the image for a second time which only proves how engrossing the film was but im willing to forgive the projectionist this time    brutal seems to be the buzzword when it comes to the northman and i cant argue that  the unfiltered savagery is like getting hit in the face with a paint can only when you look down once your vision has returned and youve regained your bearings you discover the can has spilled heaps of your favorite candy at your feet    though pulled from the same source material as shakespeares hamlet and as familiar as the story often feels surprises still abound  predominantly defying clichs there was actually a point when i asked myself wait is this a revenge story  then the movie quickly reminded me that it was and thats fine  it handles the futility of revenge in a much more subtle and effective way than say gaspar nos irrversible    despite all of this as the end credits rolled it still left me feeling slightly unfulfilled  frustratingly i cant precisely pinpoint why that is  on technical terms the mad obsession with detail convincing performances gorgeous cinematography and a deliciously complex score its inarguably a silver screen milestone  but at the end of the day it is simply a viking revenge tale albeit it one that leads to the most epic volcanic sword fight in cinema history sorry anakin  im not sure what more i was expecting  but as straightforward as it was on the whole it still manages to get inside your subconscious and linger and there are plenty of layers to peel into if one so chooses    in comparison to his previous films both of which are masterworks by my estimation the northman is much more accessible to a wider audience without losing any of the eggers magic  apparently he had to make a lot of studio compromises brought about by baffled test audiences so i certainly cant wait for the inevitable directors cut
Apr 22 2022,positive,it was ok a bit daft in some places and to many fillers and botox for the ninth century spoiled it for me 
Apr 22 2022,positive,very good fantastic acting brilliant score fantastic viking story
Apr 22 2022,negative,the movie disappointed me  i expected a lot more  it is visually beautiful however the story has been seen many times and nothing more original than other films on the same topic has been published  also the language in the film is irritating
Apr 22 2022,positive,its good kind of trippy
Apr 22 2022,positive,fantasy fantastic how a movie should be
Apr 22 2022,negative,the cast and production were great but i was not entertained by this movie i found it boring and at times annoying and ridiculous ive seen comments from people regarding the style of the movie and it being typical of the the director if you are familiar with the directors work and enjoy it this movie may be great for you perhaps i watched it too soon after watching other viking themed content such as the last kingdom and vikings its maybe a bit unfair to compare a series with a movie but i found those shows far more entertaining
Apr 22 2022,negative,it couldve been better the whole plot of the movie was too basic
Apr 22 2022,positive,excellent movie if you like that genre beautiful scenery  music
Apr 22 2022,negative,dont waste your time or money this is not about vikings its about grunting growling dirt and ill fated revenge  unrealistic cgi lots of mythology and bad acting i wanted to like this movie but by the time i was in the car headed home i was laughing at the absurdity of it
Apr 22 2022,positive,the most incredible epic i have ever seen the fusion of mythical nordic spiritualism with primal realism is incredibly amazing to watch in a world devoid of history or connection to the divine this is a true classic and will be the foundation for historical action in the future
Apr 22 2022,negative,first off  they did not make much of an effort to make it as period authentic  the clothes  some of the apparel worn could not have existed back then the speeh the songs and actors appearances there were no hordes of vikings there was no accurate ships   i mean i can go on and on about the inaccuracies and odvious and visible flobs   not happy at all   i would rather watch a netfix rerun of vikings
Apr 22 2022,positive,robert eggers has truly reached new heights with his viking epic
Apr 22 2022,positive,been a long time since a movie as entertaining as this came around trust me this feels like how movies used to be made with entertaining the audience as the main priority without cramming ideology down your throat more of this please
Apr 22 2022,positive,robert eggers has directed only three feature films each more exceptional than the one before the witch 2015 introduced many of us to the doeeyed anya taylorjoy and to eggers fascination with mysticism as a theme and surrealism as a tonal approach    in 2019 eggers the lighthouses twocharacter tour de force if one doesnt count the lighthouse itself continued in the stylistic vein of its predecessor while introducing psychosexual undertones in a stunning tale of obsession and madness    his latest the northman note eggers minimalistic approach to film titling combines all of the elements of the first two features in a restaging of the norse legend that gave shakespeares hamlet its theme and rough structure     alexander skarsgrd stars as amlet the son of a murdered chieftain ethan hawke in primeval scandinavia who pledges vengeance against his uncle claes bang for killing amlets father and marrying his mother while hiding from his uncles men  amlet grows into a fierce barbaric warrior untouched by human emotion his only thought being getting close to his uncle so that he might kill him and free his mother nicole kidman     along the way amlet is aided by various witchy seers mainly a freakish bjork which might be a redundancy and a young enslaved woman with her own plans for vengeance taylorjoy     while the northmans battle scenes are numbingly grisly the film as a totality is visually outstanding and not without a few narrative twists amlets reunion with his mother might well earn kidman a few nods come award season
Apr 22 2022,positive,praise odin robert eggers gets the chance to express his artsy and detail oriented filmmaking style with a large budget for his third film to date the northman is truly epic in every sense of the word alexander skarsgård plays prince amleth in a transformative role that almost rivals tom hardys for bane in the dark knight rises also similar to hardy he grunts his way through much of the run time eggers utilizing him perfectly as a muscular vengeance fueled berserker viking the introduction to his fury is a tense and brutal fight scene raiding a village with fellow berserkers done in impressively choreographed long takes despite the cruelty on display soon after amleths eyes are opened to his true lifes purpose with a captivating bjork cameo as a seeress delivering her prophecy to him in a nearby hut    for some background as a child amleth happily lived with his ruler parents king aurvandill warraven and queen gudrún ethan hawke and nicole kidman respectively on a norse island as the heir apparent to the throne soon after a bonding vision quest with his father and court jester heimir willem dafoe after his return from overseas aurvandill is assassinated by his brother fjölnir claes bang right in front of amleth and he flees for his life presumably joining up with vikings and learning to be a badass warrior    after his visit with the sorceress amleth learns of where his uncle is having been overthrown and exiled to a farm in iceland amleth poses as a slave meets love interest earth witch olga anya taylorjoy on his journey and blends in at the farm while secretly plotting his revenge and to rescue his mother he learns that his uncle and mother have had a son together and live a relatively simple life now as leaders in the area    despite some twists and turns along the way the plot of robert eggers the northman is a surprisingly streamlined affair especially coming from the guy who made the lynchian the lighthouse just a few years ago while the story is something youve most likely seen before multiple times it is executed in the best possible way here and with wonderful details and plenty of strange fantastical imagery throughout some moments play out like a quest in elder scrolls v skyrim like one part where amleth must duel a towering undead spirit in what looks like the bottom of an ancient ship for a magical sword he must use to take his revenge    while i loved everything about the northman i was a bit surprised that the bulk of it took place at the farm as opposed to being a grand adventure the trailer and marketing foretold so much happens though and the buildup to amleth and fjölnirs final confrontation is palpably tense to behold the performances are also fantastic all around especially nicole kidman and some others giving a career best eggers always impressive directing style and excellent script just brimming with all matter of norse and viking culture makes this an incredible work of art and the finest film of 2022
Apr 22 2022,positive,visually stunning strong acting loved every minute
Apr 22 2022,positive,beautiful and violent eggers is a master of his craft
Apr 22 2022,negative,dont waste your time or money reviews are way off on this one what a boring nothing film waste of talent i feel like i have been scammed no possible way im wrong on this movie no explanation for positive reviews i dont get it 
Apr 22 2022,positive,a wonderful viking tale from director roger eggers this film tells the story of amleth alexander skarsgård a savage who takes on a crusade of revenge to honor his slain father king aurvandil warraven ethan hawke and to free his mother queen gudrún nicole kidman hes supported by upandcomer anya taylorjoy olga and veteran willem dafoe heimir the fool beautiful scenery a poetic and at times brutal tale the film is very enjoyable i wanted to love it but wound up only liking it theres a few battle scenes early on and in the final act but outside of that the film at times comes to a screeching halt and is troubled by pacing problems skarsgård gives a very powerful performance as does taylorjoy as his oracle themes of religion magic and fate are ultimately what this is about definitely worth checking out and i am looking forward to viewing this again as this is one film where the audience will pick up more a second time around
Apr 22 2022,positive,its had some cool elements of a revenge tale like conan the barbarian but thats nothing of what it is a weirdbizarre revenge tale ethan hawke was awesome and so was william dafoe i did enjoy parts of the film and everyone in this film did a solid job the film is a one time watch for me
Apr 22 2022,positive,robert eggers the northman is a bloodsoaked journey of norse mythology transfixing visuals  good performances wrapped up in a tale of revenge alexander skarsgård is a beast
Apr 22 2022,positive,it got a little too conventional for my taste definitely expected more from eggers it was ultimately a fun time at the theater and the attention to detail regarding the mythology was nextlevel but it all wound up feeling hollow and void of an actual soul
Apr 22 2022,negative,the movie is absolutely terrible lets just say i cant write about all of the really weird stuff i didnt want to see in this kind of movie no twists no turns i love alexanders work but hollywood really let him down with their agenda i left before the move was over you saw all the good stuff in the preview true story
Apr 22 2022,positive,action packed great story ton of gore excellent movie overall 
Apr 22 2022,positive,weird strange too long exciting entertaining weird loud lots of screaming cant make up their mind what language to speak weird violent bloody weird
Apr 22 2022,positive,pretty awesome movie
Apr 22 2022,positive,another banger from eggers i could only appreciate this film more if it was released by a24
Apr 22 2022,positive,an experience rather than just a film the northman takes cinema goers on the biggest baddest and wildest ride sometimes you love it sometimes your scared sometimes you want to get off but once you do you want to get right back on again this is an epic movie with acting performances that are completely astonishing it seems unjust to release it just after the oscars   alexander skarsgaard is phenomenal terrifying one minute but still a frightened child the next the rest of the cast are superb with a special shout out to nicole kidman for going there   see this in theatres while you can it will stay with you a long time afterwards
Apr 22 2022,positive,great solid film overall great cinematography and very visceral and masterly crafted 45
Apr 22 2022,positive,gripping and gruesome in the best way possible
Apr 22 2022,positive,beautifully filmed movie very artistic not your typical viking type story like vikings on history channel or the last kingdom  definitely not the movie that was advertised though i feel as though they created trailers and previews to this movie to make it seem like an action packed viking talebut it focused more on the religious aspect and spent way too much time in my opinion focused on secondary details versus the main plot
Apr 22 2022,positive,great cinematography difficult to hear beyond the 895 viking accent although historically accurate following the story line was not trivial
Apr 22 2022,positive,i liked the witch didnt love the lighthouse i found it to be a bit too artsy for me however i loved the northman it keeps eggers core influences while also becoming large scale the action is awesome and the story is easy to follow loved it
Apr 22 2022,negative,dialog was unintelligible  the symbolism was incomprehensible  the plot was negligible  and the acting was horrible  that sums up the northman
Apr 22 2022,negative,after watching the last kingdom vikings and vikings valhalla all great incredible stories you have this expectation that it should be in some way like those shows no if youve seen the green knight then youll understand that this movie is a lot like it in a way of poetic artistic visionary far out there with a horrible soundtrack that completely takes away from understanding what the hell is going on i walked out mid way with my husband along with the couple in front of us unfortunate they had a waste of such an incredible cast that ridley scott couldnt create something breathtaking from that era cant wait for gladiator 2
Apr 22 2022,positive,overall good experience great cinematography some slowdown moments in the 2nd act but great action scenes
Apr 22 2022,positive,this a movie that taps into you most animalistic instincts and makes you want to stand up and scream with the main character this is life bloody violent manipulative and raw emotions i left the theater feeling so pumped and elated 1010 movie
Apr 22 2022,positive,vikings are metal and its just as simple as that
Apr 22 2022,positive,the movies concept ended up working well for it with twists and turns throughout the whole movie it did feel really long and had some drawn out scenes not as much fighting as id hoped but overall it was awesome the cinematography was fantastic as well
Apr 22 2022,positive,visually captivating and score was fantastic storytelling on point
Apr 22 2022,positive,perhaps a little drawn out which some may consider to be tedious but i just found it cinematically verbose well say an unequivocal banger though from eggers and i think its clear he has truly hit his stride
Apr 22 2022,positive,an epic film with a straightforward story and effective use of norse mythology  its intense rituals powerful imagery guttural and pounding music and display of culture in its authentic setting makes for an entertaining and memorable experience  stunning scenery brutal and bloody fight scenes and great acting performances i thoroughly enjoyed it
Apr 22 2022,positive,like gladiator no like the the kirk douglas vikings no weird yes enjoyable yes   will mainstream audiences appreciate no  if you like films not on the well trodden path and a bit weirddark you will enjoy
Apr 22 2022,positive,a simple story of revenge bloated with  tons of gratuitousviolence and crippled by several  plotholes that will leave anyone with half a brain wondering why did they make this movie
Apr 22 2022,positive,this may very well be eggers breakout film to a wider audience highly recommend this film
Apr 22 2022,negative,it was long drawn out and slow   there were cool magic rituals in it but i wanted a revenge movie   best part of the movie was my date spilling her drink on her shirt
Apr 22 2022,positive,movie was really unbelievable visually outstanding and beautifully violent it got a little artsy but it didnt take from the story at all must watch
Apr 22 2022,positive,not what i was expecting to watch but in no way disappointing this was a well executed revenge story we thoroughly enjoyed a 2 hour movie that was over way too soon
Apr 22 2022,positive,director robert eggers brilliantly and optimally used authentic 10th century viking sets clothing jewelry building depictions of life to immerse the audience in the story along with the mythology which i particularly enjoyed  there are not adequate words to describe the dedication and particular effort expended by the star alexander skarsgard  overall the movie was wellacted easy to understand  even with the alientomostofus concepts of 10th century viking religion and the story line gave many thinkingdiscussion topics other than just the human need for revenge  shakespeares hamlet pales beside this story from which he borrowed in plot and characterdevelopment  i highly recommend seeing the northman more than once  there is a lot to be pleasantly digested in the fine script as transposed to the big screen by alex skarsgard rob eggers et al  violence is not extreme for the expectation in viking life  i am still amazed at the production the day after my viewing  wow
Apr 22 2022,negative,simply horrible  waste of time and money   slow clearly not enough action  previews showed the best part  should have been made for netflix or prime  totally disappointed

Apr 22 2022,positive,highly enjoyable super violent stunning camera work and acting ill be watching it more then once without a doubt
Apr 22 2022,positive,a must see film in theaters
Apr 22 2022,positive,i dont care what any of these reviews have to say this is a robert eggers movie there are some slow points certainly but overall he continues to build atmosphere drawing you in for the entire length of it the battle scenes are brutal and unrelenting at times the cinematography of the entire film is dark and gritty as youd expect from this era its at the same time beautiful the best performance has to be the main character amleth anya taylor joy continues to show herself as a shooting star in the industry for anyone who is a fan of vikings robert eggers or brutal and honest interpretations of periods of history this movie is for you
Apr 22 2022,positive,an epic viking vengeance quest filled with action and brutal violence blended with robert eggers visual style of storytelling this is a masterful work of art i will watch 100 times makes me wants to reach the gates of hel or the halls of valhalla film of the year
Apr 22 2022,positive,the raw hatred and vengeance in this movie was phenomenally portrayed i will watch this movie again
Apr 22 2022,negative,one of the worst movies i have ever seen
Apr 22 2022,positive,loved it if your a viking fan then i shall suggest to go see it good actors and good story line
Apr 22 2022,positive,the northman is an experience that needs to be witnessed at the theater

Apr 22 2022,positive,loved the norse imagerymythology plenty of great gore too
Apr 22 2022,positive,the northman the latest offering from focus features is centered on prince amleth a boy on the verge of becoming a man when his father the king is ambushed and murdered by his uncle fjölnir while amleth narrowly escapes fjölnir kidnaps amleths mother to claim as his own 20 years later now a viking that raids slavic villages amleth meets a sorceress that reminds him of his vow of vengeance to honor his father kill his uncle and save his mother    directed by robert eggers the northman marks his third official outing in feature length filmmaking and hes already established a presence not suffering a sophomore slump with the lighthouse eggers momentum continues to grow each film vastly different from the one before it hes managed to keep his fans off balance at every turn refusing to settle into one particular type of genre or story here in the northman eggers tilt at a vengeance film hits more highs than it does lows coaxing masterful performances especially from nicole kidman eggers attempts at monumental storytelling are ultimately hindered by a lack of character development or relationship building in his attempts to go big he either forgets or neglects to focus on the smaller elements that make for great storytelling the best relationship in the film the one between young amleth and his father king aurvandill warraven is all too brief as aurvandills murder at the hands of his brother happens soon after the opening credits abandoning the finest pairing of the films characters in favor of plot progression what should be the best relationship in the movie the pairing of older amleth and olga of the birch forest comes in fits and spurts fleeting moments to converse between the two leads to a relationship that seems to be one more borne of common cause than actual love    still make no mistake the northman is all about scope an epic movie with epic landscapes and an epic third act showdown reminiscent of star wars episode iii revenge of the sith eggers is working on a scale hitherto unforeseen in his career while the vvich is about a family ostracized and isolated from society and the lighthouse is focused on two men stranded on a remote island the northman has more characters and more speaking roles than both films combined and doubled using the remarkable irish landscape to depict a world as yet untouched by the ravages of human progress cinematographer jarin blaschke who also shot the vvitch and the lighthouse is able to transport the audience back in time and into a world that no modern person would survive the unflinching brutality between warring clans and unapologetic display of violence is balanced by the fact that while many a limb are hacked off and intestine spilled there is surprisingly little amount of blood shown while its not a film for the children it shows a curious aspect of restraint that eggers seems to want to lean into the violence and barbarism that come with both the time period and with revenge films in general but yet fall just short of showing the viscera in full display    for all its crude action the overarching theme of the film is a simple one vengeance is futile whether its a righteous quest kill bill or a thirst to correct a perceived slight star trek ii the wrath of khan the idea of righting a wrong is the common key found within the subgenre while each of these films handle vengeance in different ways be it triumphant success or melancholic acceptance of fate the northmans clear condemnation of it is a mainstream rarity usually reserved for smaller character driven pieces that largely go overlooked by the general audience the theory that vengeance ultimately leads nowhere or that violence only begats more violence is a key component of the film eggers and cowriter sjon do an excellent job weaving these ideals throughout amleths ragefueled quest to seek just for his father    starring alexander skarsgård as amleth the northman is a movie that seems suited to the swedish actors 6foot4inch frame as the titular vengeful viking the film gives skarsgård plenty of time on screen but light on dialogue as a man of few words amleth plays up the trope of the stoic obsessively focused hero reminiscent of 1980s action heroes while those tropes were used effectively back then as an easy way to get around the somewhat limited acting capability of its main stars weve seen skarsgård play engaging charming characters before its a shame we get to see little of that in the northman once amleth is set on his goal his laser focus is his main asset to that end skarsgård is delightful as the brooding hero his physicality his ability to pivot from sullen to ferocious at the flip of a switch as well as his tenderness in his scene with anya taylorjoy show that skarsgård has all the ability of a leading man    unfortunately the person who suffers the most in the film is anya taylorjoy as olga of the birch forest a slavic sorceress not appearing until some 40something minutes into the film taylorjoys chemistry with skarsgård is believable more as a partner in crime than as a viable love interest for skarsgård this is due to either the films writing or editing the two dont have enough scenes together and the scenes they do have arent very long to build the rapport of two hardscrabble lovers while amleth is the films main focus olga doesnt have enough screen time to make her presence fully felt as a sorceress were only treated to one full on display of her abilities but this may be eggers attempting to stay as grounded to realism as possible within the world he built still taylorjoy is always a delight when on screen and hopefully this second collaboration between her and eggers leads to many more    claes bang provides possibly the most interesting and nuanced performance of the film painted broadly as the antagonist in which amleth quests to exact revenge upon bangs uncle fjölnir is far from a cackling gleefully violent one dimensional character eggers and sjon take pains to flesh out fjölnir as more than just a target for amleths sword some of the best antagonists in fiction are the ones who fully believe their cause is the right and just one and bang turns in a solid performance as a man presented as one thing and revealed as another    the real standout of the movie as far as acting has to be nicole kidman seen at the beginning of the movie as queen gudrún amleths mother stolen and whisked away by fjölnir and reappearing sporadically about halfway through kidman uses her intermittent moments on screen to remind us why shes an academy award winning actress the depth and levels with which kidman mines gudrún is sublime to see play out on screen culminating in a confrontation between gudrún and amleth that is sure to leave some squirming in their seats kidmans performance shifts the story away from hamlet which was inspired by this story and almost into macbeth territory    with the northman director robert eggers and his team take their first real foray into action having curated two slower quieter character driven stories this film shows that the young director is capable of handling both blockbuster styled action as well as smaller more intimate fights coupled with blashkes dynamic camera and eggers decision to shoot in longer takes the action feels more real and grounded to story devoid of any flashy swordplay that could be construed as more choreography than savagery amleth hacks batters and slashes his way through his opponents the decision to have amleth and olga play mental games with their enemy in combination with amelths sword is both a gift and a curse of the film on the positive side it gives olgas character purpose pulling her weight in their fate as the brains that serves to bolster amleths brawn is a distinctly purposeful decision in showing that quests like these need not always be affairs that leave the protagonists soaked to the elbows in blood unfortunately it also hampers the films pacing the cross play between amleths action and his decisions to fall back to let olga work her witchcraft while a formidable combination makes the film feel stilted it begs the question of why when amleth is seemingly unbeatable in combat would he bother to pause to mentally torture his foes it draws the movie out for an unnecessary amount of time and while the combination of brute strength and guile works at times it makes the 137 minutes feel like 137 minutes    the films production both in sets and costumes deserves praise as well creating a muddy flea bitten and overall filth ridden world that does little to attempt to glamorize the period or view the vikings through rosetinted glasses the audience can almost feel the need to shower after watching the movie teeming with sweaty greasy men often slick with either their own blood or the blood of someone else rubbed in their face all the technical crews produced a grungy bleak world mostly devoid of any real joy or cause for celebration a continued aesthetic throughout eggers films    overall while not without its flaws the northman is an epic revenge film in every sense of the phrase arresting visual images a grandiose scope of story and strong performances make this film robert eggers biggest swing for the fences yet eggers respect and fascination for the viking culture shines as he digs into nordic mythology and creates a savagely brutal world dominated by those who take while the development between characters suffers for this world building the passion the director and his team put into the saga is undeniable even with these character and pacing issues the overall experience is one of ambition and awe
Apr 22 2022,neutral,yes it looked good but it was very slow
Apr 22 2022,positive,robert eggers is a master at the craft of filmmaking the northman is pure cinema at its finest filled with norse mythology perfectly woven into the story within accompanied by the brutality animalistic visceral and graphic nature you should expect from a viking revenge tale this is his masterpiece    
Apr 22 2022,positive,one of the best films ive watched in recent yearsa brutal tale of revenge that all of us are familiar know and seen beforeinspired by scandinavian sagas and mythologiesas a history buff i can say that most of the things are accurate and with a lot of attention to detailespecially the berserker scenes were incrediblethere were close to the real life rituals of the bronze age koryos warriorsmusicdirectioncinematographyactingeverything was amazing its a masterpiecebut its not for everyone unfortunatelysome people might get uncomfortable and disgusted by the acts of the main charactersits a film you have to watch withouth the modern point of viewand to understand how brutal were the people back thenexcuse me for my bad english
Apr 22 2022,positive,some of yall dont know great cinematic masterpieces when you see them i respect yalls opinions and everything but this movie was fucking incredible holy shitttt cant wait to buyyy
Apr 22 2022,positive,a berserker of a movie amazing
Apr 22 2022,positive,a stunning take on the norse sagas on the big screen
Apr 22 2022,neutral,excessively absurdly violent with very little in the sense of story and developed characters to give said violence meaning and purpose i appreciate the talent involved but it is hard to understand what the film was looking to achieve as a mediation on viking violence and norse lore it is mildly entertaining but doesnt hold a candle to valhalla rising 2009 as far as plot and character go it is all rather onedimensional engaging in places but meandering for the most par
Apr 22 2022,negative,waste of time amazing how bad this movie is considering all of the excellent movies and series streaming online literally one of the worst movies ive seen this year and definitely the worst viking drama in a while i dozed off a couple of times this movie is not the caliber we expect the lead actors to be involved with dont pay to see this movie i rarely complete these reviews but was so disgusted with movie i had to do this one
Apr 22 2022,positive,absolute cinematic masterpiece robert eggers understands the assignment on this viking folklore and he delivered mightily abs massively never seen a viking movie like this in my lifetime
Apr 22 2022,positive,great directing and cinematography plot is a known shakespearean play you will catch that from the name of the protagonist in the fist moments of the movie with a viking twist sprinkled with norse mythology some great moments very dark gritty intense with a lot of violence i enjoyed immensely dont  go to movie waiting for large battle scenes is not that kind of film
Apr 22 2022,positive,an amazing and unique screenplay
Apr 22 2022,negative,first time ive ever wanted to walk out in the middle of a movie couldnt wait until it was over terrible 2 thumbs down
Apr 22 2022,positive,amazing cinematography great story with lots of twists and turns
Apr 22 2022,positive,like all of eggers films if you dont fully understand the lore youll likely be stuck at times although mostly good i think it may be eggers weakest film yet     6210  mostly good  fresh review
Apr 22 2022,positive,holy hell the northman lived up to my most anticipated film of 2022 robert eggers massacred this movie in the most profound way possible alexander skarsgaard was epic the cinematography was phenomenal  the sound effects were otherworldly the acting was truly wonderful the combat scenes were brutal af the pacing was perfect overall the best film ive seen in 2022  will stay that way
Apr 22 2022,negative,a story we have seen many many timesrevengegreek tragedy characters and plot not impressively deep yes the cinematography is impressive does this make for a good movie no go watch hamlet instead which adds an existential spin on the same old story of revenge
Apr 22 2022,positive,best movie of 2022 so far i love it
Apr 22 2022,negative,story leans hard on the spiritual and psychedelic to hide its simple and uninteresting story movie is unnecessarily burtal and gory at times while im okay with this normally it just seemed unearned and distracting in this movie
Apr 22 2022,positive,an artistic take on the scandinavian legend of amleth which later inspired hamlet may be too complex for most audiences but a well made film regardless although it may feel slow and predictable at times the northman finds its footing within the brutal combat well played characters and visually pleasing cinematography
Apr 22 2022,neutral,not a bad movie but i was quite disappointed i expected better i wish they didn t used that stereotypical accent and instead they used a nordic language with an all nordic cast some of the secondary characters were not as good as the main cast and the script could have been much better
Apr 22 2022,positive,the acting was good and i liked it but it wasnt quite what i expected  there werent any characters in the movie that i reallly liked but it was a handsome picture
Apr 22 2022,positive,fantastic revenge film captivating from start to finish with beautifully shot cinematography if youve seen eggers past films this is definitely the most accessible loved it
Apr 22 2022,positive,most badass epic flick in recent memory
Apr 22 2022,positive,it doesnt get much fresher than this movie very intense movie a real trip
Apr 22 2022,positive,from start to finish my jaw was hitting the floor for most of the movie so yeah go see this movie this weekend
Apr 22 2022,negative,i should have left at the fart scene nuff said
Apr 22 2022,positive,it was very well done it truly represents the norse culture of the period and the story line is very well done yes its a repeat but with differencesyou will have to see for yourself
Apr 22 2022,positive,this is a feast for people that has the guts to see a realistic viking movie many jawdropping scenes especially the last one  eggers did it again i cant wait for his next movie
Apr 22 2022,negative,if there was a 0 i would do that this movie was a contest of who could act the most bizarre i would prefer to watch the catfish trailer on loop for 25 hrs than watch this once unfortunately i cant undo my wasted time but you can save yours there was zero depth to the story line and just a bunch of grown men howling and strange dancing
Apr 22 2022,positive,truly epic the word badass doesnt even come close to describing every single scene its one of those films that has everything you would ever want and doesnt let up the entire time 
Apr 22 2022,negative,i feel asleep twice the story was so dull and obvious to see just a bunch of screaming weird rituals and sacrifices bad actor as the main lead hes like 40 something and takes him 30 years to go back and get revenge and they look barely aged what also the lack of viking history and its non sexual respect of women is very inaccurate in the movie just bad
Apr 22 2022,positive,i wish some movies were as exciting and epic as the movie trailers promise them to be i was looking forward to this movie for months      this is a slow moving film full of supposed rituals symbolisms spirits and curses lots of yelling annoying supposed northmen accents banging the sword on their shields while dancing almost naked in the mud around a fire the tale is simple the dialogue simply needlesley drags it out the action scenes are few and far between aleksandr skarsgaard however  got into an impressive shape of the likes of the 300 movie level cast washboard abs pecs and all     it wasnt a waste of time but disappointing for me there were a few people that clapped at the end not sure if it was because the film was over or because they liked the ending a couple leaving the theater summed it up as a little shakespearean the  guy replied a little
Apr 22 2022,positive,overall 8510 great score and cinematography performances were solid and action was brutal story is one thatll stick with you if you let it dont go in expecting nonstop action
Apr 22 2022,positive,so much action better than gladiator and braveheart

Apr 22 2022,positive,this movie is an absolute masterpiece and very unique to be expected of robert eggers
Apr 22 2022,positive,no ones making movies like this anymore a total breath of fresh air
Apr 22 2022,neutral, a bloody tale of betrayal and the revenge that tracks the life of a nordic prince that flees his kingdom to survive and exact revenge for the treacherous murder of his father and the enslavement of his mother a group of murderous vikings take him in as a boy and he grows to become a vicious warrior that will use his particular set of skills to kill the man that was responsible for his lifes upheaval if you are a viking enthusiasts or just seeking mindless murderous action then you may find this one entertaining aside from this its a tale told far too often coughconan
Apr 22 2022,neutral,i guess i was expecting the movie to be more along the lines of the viking series no where close i personally was very disappointed
Apr 22 2022,positive,its a excellent movie the director show us the cruelty raw and violent strong character on the viking age the photography is beautiful the music is fantastic

Apr 22 2022,positive,amazing story it has some of the most badass visuals and beautiful cinematography its different with mostly grounded elements but a good bit of supernatural pieces the northman meeted my expectations while adding a completely different element to the movie i was not expecting but was definitely pleased with  i have a feeling this movie will become even better the next time i watch it
Apr 22 2022,positive,the simplest review i can give is gladiator meets the green knight
Apr 22 2022,positive,very interesting and entertaining movie
Apr 22 2022,positive,the northman had a great story line and fantastic scenes best movie ive seen in months
Apr 22 2022,positive,a visual epic my wife loses attention easily and was engaged on the edge of her seat research a some basic norse mythology and culture and you will have no problem understanding the plot gripping action scenes director does a great job building angry tension
Apr 22 2022,positive,good movie cant complain
Apr 22 2022,positive,amazing visually breathtaking pacing though seems a bit fast the story is solid somewhat predictable and imo the film shouldve been longer overall a amazing film with a superb score
Apr 22 2022,positive,i have come tonight to the northman already a huge roger eggers fan  i believe his work is unique researched and full of passion for epic story telling  add to this a remarkable eye that seeks to reveal extraordinary scenes filled with wonderand acting of the highest order  i think perhaps mr eggers greatest feat is his connection to his cast the performances sing with commitment and full throttle surrender to their directors vision  alexander skassgard astounds as a viking princenicole kidman is superb unleashing intense venom and willem defoe who is already an eggers familiar brand face emotes and smolders beautifullyanya taylor joy another eggers brand actor who once again manages to show further facets to her magical charisma  add to this surprises like bjork and a fiery volcano all told for a director who has had two previous small budget films that raised the hairs on the back of your neck as well as your consciousnessthe northman stands as his opusone cannot wait to see what mr eggers sets his sights on nextthe anticipation level remains intact  he represents a mysterious heady mix of unadulterated talent a penchant for metaphysical story telling and bravura  skol
Apr 22 2022,positive,good movie but maybe less action than i though there might be  still an excellent movie
Apr 22 2022,positive,thenorthman is a gnarly grizzly grand period piece from robert eggers with a wellacted cast and impressive cinematography and vfx that make the movie look like a mashup of thewitcher gameofthrones and thegreenknight jacked and on steroids
Apr 22 2022,positive,thenorthman is a gnarly grizzly grand period piece from robert eggers with a wellacted cast and impressive cinematography and vfx that make the movie look like a mashup of thewitcher gameofthrones and thegreenknight jacked and on steroids

Apr 22 2022,neutral,i didnt get it too many dream sequences for me more artsy than i expected
Apr 22 2022,negative,epic failure to deliver on the viking battles that were advertised 
Apr 22 2022,positive,this movie right here they dont make em like this no more for once i agree with most critics this is a hell of a movie and the people complaining on here about the story are the reason movies like this dont get made any more  seems like every other movie that comes out is a dumb super hero movie  i wish we got more movies like this everybody is giving hamlet comparisons the best way i can describe it is lion king for adults  everybody get out there and support this movie so maybe we can get more movies like this see it on the biggest screen possible
Apr 22 2022,positive,this is not a great film period these amazing reviews are from children and non experienced movie goers the plot has holes kidmans performance is laughable  it passes the time thats about it 
Apr 22 2022,negative,focused to much on artistic story telling and less on the action and battle scenes that should have ensued big letdown like watching 300 with no action
Apr 22 2022,positive,fantastic movie strange raw  beautiful

Apr 22 2022,neutral,not something i would ever watch again    bad acting and slow
Apr 22 2022,negative,was the longest steaming pile off poop ive watched in a long time visually it was ok but everything else about it was dreadful
Apr 22 2022,positive,for me it good not great i thought the mini series the vikings on television was better
Apr 22 2022,positive,amazing movie with great detail and story telling unlike any movie ive seen before
Apr 22 2022,positive,incredible film the beginning was a bit slow and the kid version of amleth was not a good actor harvey scrimshaw was much better in eggers the witch for example but the rest of the film was simply incredible i cant put it into words
Apr 22 2022,positive,definitely a huge step for robert eggers with a big cast including some of his stalwart actors and actresses to make something worth revisiting over and over again 
Apr 22 2022,positive,the movie is a masterpiece normally the media portrays vikings and prechristian scandinavia very inaccurately but the northman nailed it a definite mustsee
Apr 22 2022,positive,robert eggers is a genius  this is his best work so far and all his films are great
Apr 22 2022,neutral,i cant really say what i watched but there wasnt much to remark on
Apr 22 2022,positive,fantastic  a good one word to sum up this excellent telling of this viking story very down to earth and grounded in a very indie filming style but also steeped in mysticsm and all the makings of a bigger budget fantasy epic an excellent chilling beastly performance by alex skarsgard with of course great supporting performances from ethan hawke nicole kidman and anjlya taylor joy well crafted and beautifully shot film very visceral and brutal action the slow burn nature of the film and how much it is steeped in viking lore may be a turn off to mainstream audiences i recommend anyone go see it and give it a chance well with the price of admission if you like viking films or fantasy films in general
Apr 22 2022,positive,brilliant what a masterpiece im still speechless and blown away the cast is superb and the production values are just insane should be an oscar contender for best picture and noms for skarsgard that carries the movie and nicole kidman that is mesmerizing as queen gudrun all of them have their moments two big thumbs up
Apr 22 2022,negative,one of the worst movies i have ever seen the plot somehow managed to move slow and fast at the same time the story jumped all over the place the cgi and weird camera angles were terrible do not recommend
Apr 22 2022,negative,gore with no purpose or meaning
Apr 22 2022,positive,truly one of the most accomplished films ive ever seen this is eggers and his team especially dp jarin blaschke firing on all cylinders
Apr 22 2022,positive,robert eggers at his finest you can see his fingerprints in event shot mastermind

Apr 22 2022,positive,expected more from skarsgards character he was kind of a wimp at times not a bad movie just not great 
Apr 22 2022,negative,this movie is nothing like the preview makes you think it is this is one of the worst movies ive ever seen the entire movie has a nothing but witchcraft and revenge there is nothing enjoyable in the entire 2hour and 20 minute waste of time
Apr 22 2022,negative,needed more action and did not like the ending he should not have lied
Apr 22 2022,positive,its 2022s best film of the year so far and robert eggerss masterpiece this is top level filmmaking well worth your time i cant say enough about how remarkable eggers does here directing this he brings his a game in every frame the cinematography is quite stunning and beautifully captures the period dont just put it on your to do list go see it in the theater right now the northman receives my highest recommendation 
Apr 22 2022,negative,this story is straight up bad should have left after first act so disappointed and have no idea what critics are thinking was good here i love a gladiator braveheart and even vikings tv show but this was unwatchable wasted talents of lead actors and actresses wow im disappointed
Apr 22 2022,positive,i really like robert eggers work this kind of movie isnt for thy weary absolutely perfect 1010
Apr 22 2022,positive,so i am not a huge into vikings norse gods etc but everyone in the film community was raving about thenorthman and i figured i would take a look at it and honestly its the most brutal and bloodiest movie ive seen in a very long time out of the gate you clearly know this film isnt for kids everything in this was bare knuckle dirty grind your teeth type of action there were a few moments where i went they did that its so visceral that you cannot look away and yet have to at the same time this movie didnt have much dialogue and it didnt need to the looks on the characters faces could tell the story there was a very weird twist with kidmans character that i honestly didnt see coming either overall this movie is probably vikings on steroids once you watch it youll see what i mean i give the northman 45 bloody swords out of 5
Apr 22 2022,positive,good movie is a  historical movie
Apr 22 2022,positive,its a viking themed actionadventure executed pretty well i didnt check my watch even once which is more than i can say for most movies i see consider bringing earplugs as it gets quite loud
