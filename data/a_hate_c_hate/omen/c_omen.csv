Apr 8 2023,positive, welcome back to the scariest and at times goriest column here at film inquiry horrific inquiry twice a month i will be tackling all things horror bringing two films back into the spotlight to terrify and frighten once more and occasionally looking at those that could have pushed the envelope further join us as we dive deep into the heart of horror but warning there will be spoilers its all for you damien its all for you  the omen 2006religion is a primary element within a plethora of horror films their deeply rooted theologies creating the perfect stage for terror retribution and even at times redemption where many horror films harness the horror of religious belief in the form of possession not all lean into the occupation of the devil some are far worse some speak to the dawn of armageddonwhat makes these religious based horrors so terrifying is their grounding in a true belief of the power of the devil and hell there is a constant belief of unknown forces working to deceive and undermine whether it be through a host or the birth of the antichrist and with the stories throughout the catholic faith of exorcisms and the book of revelation mapping out the end of times it is hard to deny to deny the belief of its truthfulness horror films have been able to tap into this terror shifting and molding it bringing our fears to life for some these films succeed in the terror they are charged to create for others it is pure entertainment when it comes to the omen it feels as though more entertainment is to be had rather than horror yet finds its own layer of terror that extends beyond religiondelivering the antichrista remake of the 1976 classic john moores the omen was released on june 06 2006 i remember going to the film not because i had an interest in the omen itself but because it was an antichrist film showing on the dreaded day of 666 it was a brilliant marketing campaign as i remember the theater being packed an air of defiance filling the room as the audience collectively embraced the idea of what the release day symbolized honestly no matter the quality of the film i have found that those films that have a collective audience experience are the films that stick with the viewer the most and i have not forgotten the omen sincesource 20th century foxas the film opens it does not hesitate to get itself moving the opening credits immediately presenting the 666 before transitioning to the vatican observatory in rome its telescope displaying the arrival of a comet similar to the one spoken of the night jesus was born yet the look on the priests face does not match one of exultation but rather terror a convention called the book of revelation read allowed the angels trumpets of armageddon paired with reallife disasters signifying the completion of each stage the challenger explosion the devastation of hurricane katrina the 2004 tsunami and the fall of the twin towers are each cited the comets arrival is the latest sign the world is on the eve of armageddonthe omen holds for a moment on this information before transitioning to robert thorne liev schreiber who is on his way to meet his wife kate julia stiles currently in labor and experiencing complications as he arrives at the hospital the low lighting within the halls speaks to deals made in the shadows and while robert does not know the deal he is making he makes it all the same informed that his child has died in birth he accepts the words of father spiletto gionanni lombardo radice without question even when he is guided away from the idea of seeing his child he momentarily grieves for the loss of his son and for the now barren state of his wife this meant so much to her he saysthere is a sweetness in the father before him as he asks robert to accept the lords plan to welcome a new chance to give love to another he shows robert another boy that was born in the same hour of his son his mother dying in childbirth robert reluctant at first agrees to take the boy and raise it as his own allowing his wife to believe he is the child she birthed this entire opening sequence sets the stage for the rise of the antichrist these initial deceptions some in love will follow many of the films characters until its closing moments proving that the power of the devil is always lurking and ready to strikethe antichrist riseskate works as the constant representation of a state of uncertainty from the moment she awakens and is presented the child her first question to her husband is who is this she speaks to the deeply ingrained nature of a mothers innate knowledge of her child while brief this moment speaks to kates knowing this is not her child as the first three years of damiens life are shown through a montage of memories there is no doubt about the love and acceptance he experiences from his two parents yet a rise of an antichrist is not immediate but rather slow and meticulous it starts with a lie that grows and becomes empowered by the happenings around that life for the thornes an announcement that they are to move to london with the newly promoted united states ambassador sets the next action in motion for damien to risesource 20th century foxas the current ambassador finds himself stuck in traffic the omen leans into a final destination sequence of an allknowing death coming for its latest victim as a truck pins the ambassador in his limo a cigarette explodes the vehicle  and robert throne is promoted to ambassador of the us embassy in london placing him in a political position of power and as the film moves ahead two more years another element of the prophecy of the antichrist is fulfilleddamien seamus daveyfitzpatrick and kate are the first to be reintroduced following the time jump at the park kate takes a call with no one on the other line damien disappearing in the moments it took for her to end the call as she franticly searches for her son he leaps out from behind her in an attempt to scare her there is a deeply felt concern for her son her establishing the deep bond between them  and her deeply rooted concern in losing him in retrospect the film is clever in including this moment rather than moving straight to the death of the nanny it speaks to the connection of mother and son even as an audience we know this is one crafted out of love rather than biological connection but it also speaks to a possible underlining belief within kate that damien is not hers  that at any moment she could lose himas we move from kate to damiens fifth birthday party the film begins to change its pace moving from slow meticulous preparation to an everincreasing pace of success the pieces have been moved into place over the years and the final moves come swiftly as kate takes her son the nanny becomes overcome by an unspoken request from a dog in the courtyard the score swells with a haunting whispering feel culminating in the nanny killing herself in front of the guests the is a capture of shock and disbelief in the party guests almost as time has slowed down and while the camera franticly tries to capture the explosion of trauma and horror it finally settles on damien it holds on damien waving at the dog his emotions absent of feeling for the loss of the young womenand while the antichrist may rise there are always those who are tasked to prevent itprevention is futilethis comes in the form of robert photographer keith david thewlis and father brennan pete postlethwaite for father brennan this is a chance for redemption he was a part of the deception to swap the child from the beginning putting damien in robert and kates care yet as we discover cancer that riddles his body has him at deaths door he makes a plea for robert to accept christ into his heart and to kill the boy he warns robert of the prophecy of the grave danger to his wife and to himself yet try as he might the devil is always one step aheadsource 20th century foxfor keith it is the chance to literally save his neck as his photographs have proven the devil leaves a mark on those it has targeted to kill for the nanny the rope shows up as a blurry line around her neck for father brennan a spike draws closer to his body each time his photo is taken and for keith a slice across the neck it once again speaks to final destination specifically the third film the devil and death giving a hopeless attempt to be stopped for keith he is given the foresight but not the purest of intentions for successand finally there is robert he pushes back against the truth refusing to believe his son is the antichrist and the task he must carry out to end him as father brennan states once the child has taken everything from him he will kill robert as well for robert it is the truth that becomes his undoing as he learns of kates death he does not accept the truth of christ into his heart but rather the truth of revenge he does not make the decision to kill damien because he is the antichrist but rather because he killed kate this is further driven home as robert finds the body of his real son in the cemetery his skull bashed in he wants revenge for the son he never had and for the wife he lost and the moment he gives into revenge he accepts that damien has taken everything from him and allows that truth to settle in both his heart and his mindyet if either of these men had stopped walking down the path they traveled the antichrist would have still risen but they may have lived to see it as they each make their decisions to prevent the rise of damien death befalls them father brennan is impaled after revealing the prophecy to robert keith after turning back to get the knives robert refused to stab his son with and robert at the moment just before placing the knife in damiens chestthe end heralded by menit was early in the film that i concluded that the end of the world would be heralded by men now it is important to note that it is not strictly by an evil that it will be heralded rather with a combination kindness pride and malice this is seen early as robert arrives at the hospital father spiletto offering the swapping of the children we know the malicious intent of father spiletto even if not as deep as it truly runs yet it is robert who makes the decision to take the child  without the inclusion of his wife this is a decision he makes on his own for both the kindness of his wife and for the child yet as antique as it is he is the one that makes the decision that will change the course of his family  alonesource 20th century foxrobert fails to listen to father brennan as well even though he knows that what the father speaks of the child to some degree is true and there are only a handful of people who know the truth about damiens paternity there is pride in the arrogance and dismissal of robert and even as he is about to tell his wife he holds back eventually taking the secret of damiens paternity to his gravehis pride in his dismissal of father brennan extends to kate as well following the death of the nanny and the attack by damien in the car kate expresses a desire to have damien checked by a doctor as robert scoffs at kate that the child has never been sick a day in his life kate expresses how weird that is especially in comparison to other children this is compounded by the search for a new nanny robert proposing that kate no longer needs a nanny and could present an opportunity for her to further bond with damien his quiet criticism speaks both to his underlying knowledge of damiens paternity but also kates growing suspicion that something is wrong with damien as she speaks of always being there to raise her child there is a sneaking suspicion that her question from the beginning who is this was not a passing comment rather the start of kates struggle with an unknown truthas kate struggles with her feelings regarding damien especially following an incident at the zoo she decides to seek help robert not only allows this to happen but allows the shrink to treat kate as though she were crazy as the shrink discloses to robert kate believes in her head that her son is evil and that he isnt hers as robert sits there listening he does not correct the doctor by revealing the truth rather he allows the doctor and his wife to continue on as though she is crazy he even goes as far as to state to the doctor that kates wishes for an abortion will not be fulfilled once again he makes the decision not kate it is this decision that allows the next action of the prophecy to be enacted  the killing of the unborn child in the womb and even after damiens attempt to kill kate and successful attempt to kill the baby inside her as she pleads with robert to not let him kill her he says nothing of the truth and gives little comfort in his growing understanding of the threat and the truth that looms over themand finally it is roberts thirst for revenge that seals his heralding of the apocalypse if he had put his pride aside and listened to what father brennan had said he might have stood a chance but instead becomes the final piece of the prophecy comes to fruitionconclusionwhile a smaller part of the film it is hard not to look at the terrifying aspect of the devils ability to prey on empathy the entirety of the film and the prophecy hangs on roberts empathy and love for his wife to take the child as his kates death too weighs on the empathy of the nurse charged with protecting and caring for her as mrs baylock mia farrow preys on the emotion of a son missing his injured mother to gain access to her room and in the final moments as robert is about to plunge the knife into damiens chest damien cries out please daddy dont the words cut deep and stop robert just for a moment but a moment too long the police here shown as faceless individuals arrive and shoot robert deadthe omen may be a film about the antichrist but it is also a film that looks at the ills of man the ability of evil to conquer good and the role of the power we all process to play in the rise of evil it is a film that can lend itself to different perspectives of examination and various interpretations of meaning

revealing the truth rather he allows the doctor and his wife to continue on as though she is crazy he even goes as far as to state to the doctor that kates wishes for an abortion will not be fulfilled once again he makes the decision not kate it is this decision that allows the next action of the prophecy to be enacted  the killing of the unborn child in the womb and even after damiens attempt to kill kate and successful attempt to kill the baby inside her as she pleads with robert to not let him kill her he says nothing of the truth and gives little comfort in his growing understanding of the threat and the truth that looms over themand finally it is roberts thirst for revenge that seals his heralding of the apocalypse if he had put his pride aside and listened to what father brennan had said he might have stood a chance but instead becomes the final piece of the prophecy comes to fruitionconclusionwhile a smaller part of the film it is hard not to look at the terrifying aspect of the devils ability to prey on empathy the entirety of the film and the prophecy hangs on roberts empathy and love for his wife to take the child as his kates death too weighs on the empathy of the nurse charged with protecting and caring for her as mrs baylock mia farrow preys on the emotion of a son missing his injured mother to gain access to her room and in the final moments as robert is about to plunge the knife into damiens chest damien cries out please daddy dont the words cut deep and stop robert just for a moment but a moment too long the police here shown as faceless individuals arrive

telescope displaying the arrival of a comet similar to the one spoken of the night jesus was born yet the look on the priests face does not match one of exultation but rather terror a convention called the book of revelation read allowed the angels trumpets of armageddon paired with reallife disasters signifying the completion of each stage the challenger explosion the devastation of hurricane katrina the 2004 tsunami and the fall of the twin towers are each cited the comets arrival is the latest sign the world is on the eve of armageddon the omen holds for a moment on this information before transitioning to robert thorne liev schreiber who is on his way to meet his wife kate julia stiles currently in labor and experiencing complications as he arrives at the hospital the low lighting within the halls speaks to deals made in the shadows and while robert does not know the deal he is making he makes it all the same informed that his child has died in birth he accepts the words of father spiletto gionanni lombardo radice without question even when he is guided away from the idea of seeing his child he momentarily grieves for the loss of his son and for the now barren state of his wife this meant so much to her he saysthere is a sweetness in the father before him as he asks robert to accept the lords plan to welcome a new chance to give love to another he shows robert another boy that was born in the same hour of his son his mother dying in childbirth robert reluctant at first agrees to take the boy and raise it as his own allowing his wife to believe

knowing this is not her child as the first three years of damiens life are shown through a montage of memories there is no doubt about the love and acceptance he experiences from his two parents yet a

to himself yet try as he might the devil is always one step aheadsource 20th century foxfor keith it is the chance to literally save his neck as his photographs have proven the devil leaves a mark on

across the neck it once again speaks to final destination specifically the third film the devil and death giving a hopeless attempt to be stopped for keith he is given the foresight but not the purest of intentions for successand finally there is robert he pushes back against the truth refusing to believe his son is the antichrist and the task he must carry out to end him as father brennan states once the child has taken everything from him he will kill robert as well for robert it is the truth that becomes his undoing as he learns of kates death he does not accept the truth of christ into his heart but rather the truth of revenge he does not make the decision to kill damien because he is the antichrist but rather because he killed kate this is further driven home as robert finds the body of his real son in the cemetery his skull bashed in he wants revenge for the son he never had and for the wife he lost and the moment he gives into revenge he accepts that damien has taken everything from him and allows that truth to settle in both his heart and his mindyet if either of these men had stopped walking down the path they traveled the antichrist would have still risen but they may

his undoing as he learns of kates death he does not accept the truth of christ into his heart but rather the truth of revenge he does not make the decision to kill damien because he is the antichrist but rather because he killed kate this is further driven home as robert finds the body of his real son in the cemetery his skull bashed in he wants revenge for the son he never had and for the wife he lost and the moment he gives into revenge he accepts that damien has taken everything from him and allows that truth to settle in both his heart and his mindyet if either of these men had stopped walking down the path they traveled the antichrist would have still risen but they may have lived to see it as they each make their decisions to prevent the rise of damien death befalls them father brennan is impaled after revealing the prophecy to robert keith after turning back to get the knives robert refused to stab his son with and robert at the moment just before placing the knife in damiens chestthe end heralded by menit was early in the film that i concluded that the end of the world would be heralded by men now it is important to note that it is not strictly by an evil that it will be heralded rather with a combination kindness pride and malice this is seen early as robert arrives at the hospital father spiletto offering the swapping of the children we know the malicious intent of father spiletto even if not as deep as it truly runs yet it is robert who makes the decision to take the child  without the inclusion of his wife this is a decision he makes on his own for both the kindness of his wife and for the child yet as antique as it is he is the one that makes the decision that will change the course of his family  alonesource 20th century foxrobert fails to listen to father brennan as well even though he knows that what the father speaks of the child to some degree is true and there are only a handful of people who know the truth about damiens paternity there is pride in the arrogance and dismissal of robert and even as he is about to tell his wife he holds back eventually taking the secret of damiens paternity to his gravehis pride in his dismissal of father brennan extends to kate as well following the death of the nanny and the attack by damien in the car kate expresses a desire to have damien checked by a doctor as robert scoffs at kate that the child has never been sick a day in his life kate expresses how weird that is especially in comparison to other children this is compounded by the search for a new nanny robert proposing that kate no longer needs a nanny and could present an opportunity for her to further bond with damien his quiet criticism speaks both to his underlying knowledge of damiens paternity but also kates growing suspicion that something is wrong with damien as she speaks of always being there to raise her child there is a sneaking suspicion that her question from the beginning who is this was not a passing comment rather the start of kates struggle with an unknown truthas kate struggles with her feelings regarding damien especially following an incident at the zoo she decides to seek help robert not only allows this to happen but allows the shrink to treat kate as though she were crazy as the shrink discloses to robert kate believes in her head that her son is evil and that he isnt hers as robert sits there listening he does not correct the doctor by revealing the truth rather he allows the doctor and his wife to continue on as though she is crazy he even goes as far as to state to the doctor that kates wishes for an abortion will not be fulfilled once again he makes the decision not kate it is this decision that allows the next action of the prophecy to be enacted  the killing of the unborn child in the womb and even after damiens attempt to kill kate and successful attempt to kill the baby inside her as she pleads with robert to not let him kill her he says nothing of the truth and gives little comfort in his growing understanding of the threat and the truth that looms over themand finally it is roberts thirst for revenge that seals his heralding of the apocalypse if he had put his pride aside and listened to what father brennan had said he might have stood a chance but instead becomes the final piece of the prophecy comes to fruitionconclusionwhile a smaller part of the film it is hard not to look at the terrifying aspect of the devils ability to prey on empathy the entirety of the film and the prophecy hangs on roberts empathy and love for his wife to take the child as his kates death too weighs on the empathy of the nurse charged with protecting and caring for her as mrs baylock mia farrow preys on the emotion of a son missing his injured mother to gain access to her room and in the final moments as robert is about to plunge the knife into damiens chest damien cries out please daddy dont the words cut deep and stop robert just for a moment but a moment too

preparation to an everincreasing pace of success the pieces have been moved into place over the years and the final moves come swiftly as kate takes her son the nanny becomes overcome by an unspoken request from a dog in the courtyard the score swells with a haunting whispering feel culminating in the nanny killing herself in front of the guests the is a capture of shock and disbelief in the party guests almost as time has slowed down and while the camera franticly tries to capture the explosion of trauma and horror it finally settles on damien it holds on damien waving at the dog his emotions absent of feeling for the loss of the young women and while the antichrist may rise there are always those who are tasked to prevent itprevention is futilethis comes in the form of robert

his underlying knowledge of damiens paternity but also kates growing suspicion that something is wrong with damien as she speaks of always being there to raise her child there is a sneaking suspicion that her question from the beginning who is this was not a passing comment rather the start of kates struggle with an unknown truthas kate struggles with her feelings regarding damien especially following an incident at the zoo she decides to seek help robert not only allows this to happen but allows the shrink to treat kate as though she were crazy as the shrink discloses to robert kate believes in her head that her son is evil and that he isnt hers as robert sits there listening he does not correct the doctor by revealing the truth rather he allows the doctor and his wife to continue on as though she is crazy he even goes as far as to state to the doctor that kates wishes for an abortion will not be fulfilled once again he makes the decision not kate it is this decision that allows the next action of the prophecy to be enacted  the killing of the unborn child in the womb and even after damiens attempt to kill kate and successful attempt to kill the baby inside her as she pleads with robert to not let him kill her he says nothing of the truth and gives little comfort in his growing understanding of the threat and the truth that looms over themand finally it is

Sep 20 2022,negative, for a while back in the 70s horror movies had weighty things on their minds americans were concerned about the real presence of evil in the world  terrorism an unpopular war a widely hated president  so lucifer himself the fallen angel representing a fallen country brought his brimstone stench into theaters americans were afraid of their own children so in many cases satan took the form of a cherub americans were uneasy about the middle east so in films like the exorcist 1973 and the omen 1976 all the trouble started there  or at least all the spooky evidence was found there gee how things have changed 911 columbine an unpopular war in the middle east  the stars mr thorn i say unto you the stars have aligned for the ghastly return of the adversary well either that or june 6 2006 was a really cool release date for a remake of the omen as before ambassador robert thorn liev schreiber in for gregory peck and his wife katherine julia stiles replacing lee remick find themselves the adoptive parents of the scowling young antichrist  damien seamus daveyfitzpatrick who by all appearances is a perfectly normal fiveyearold boy but who is attended by a snarling black dog and a nanny named mrs baylock mia farrow who speaks of having been sent by the agency that would be i presume the famous nannies from hell agency established 1976 by billie whitelaw thirty years experience protecting your hellchild from the sharp knives of meggido call today the omen was ridiculous in 1976 and its ridiculous now richard donners original film an unstable mix of oldhollywood pomp and postvietnam bloodletting moves like a snail across an acre of flypaper any residual affection attached to it by horror fans derives more or less solely from its freakish death scenes for that these days we turn to the final destination series which do the omen series one better by making the villain death himself i will say that thirty years of specialeffects evolution have given us more realistic renditions of the churchimpalespriest bit and the whoopstheregoesyourhead bit i can also testify that the final scene between the hapless katherine and the ruthless mrs baylock plays out much more credibly here than in the original wherein  not to spoil it  we did have to wonder wait what and she got away with it julia stiles is a terrific actress in the right role which isnt what shes got here stiles is twentyfive but could still pass for fifteen and she will probably have to wait another ten years before seeming remotely believable  or comfortable  playing a mom she may be too spiky a presence to exude maternal instincts anyway while she may if she chooses make a fine reallife mother someday its all about how she comes across on film as for liev schreiber he responds to the challenge of following gregory peck by going small and minimalist peck was certainly a stoic slice of ham but he could get it together and get his voice up when necessary schreiber just lets the plot bulldoze him a passive hero unconsciously aping tom hanks in the da vinci code trailing behind people who are always telling him what things mean omen 06 did bangup business on june 6 perhaps owing to all the giggly teens and twentysomethings who responded as expected to the brilliant calendar marketing whether it has enough staying power to warrant remakes of 1978s damien  omen ii the antichrist as conflicted teenager and 1981s the final conflict the antichrist as donald trump remains to be seen it ranked fourth over the weekend presumably abandoned by those who didnt want to be so unhip as to see it on june 10 or something even if sequels are planned though the precedent of the 666 release date presents a practical problem there wont be another opportunity for this kind of gregorian synergy until june 6 2106 that means any subsequent omen movie will just have to come out on like a friday bummer
Nov 19 2019,neutral, i was but a wee lad when 8220the omen hit theaters in 1976 but i remember the film enough to know that it scared the crap out of me now 30 years later comes a remake just in time for 6606 and although this version is a respectful retelling it doesnt seem to have much of a purpose like gus van sants remake of 8220psycho 8220the omen just doesnt bring anything new to the table for those unfamiliar with 8220the omen the movie tells the story of a us ambassador robert thorn liev schreiber whose wife katherine julia stiles has a stillborn child the ambassador decides without his wifes knowledge to substitute another baby whose mother died during birth and raise the child they named damien as their own director john moore is very respectful to the original with almost a shotforshot recreation in this version while ill admit the film is well made it lacks the tension and sense of doom that made the original work seamus daveyfitzpatrick is pretty creepy as damien and mia farrow shines as damiens replacement nanny but schreiber and stiles cant compare in roles originally done by gregory peck and lee remick i suppose there will be an audience out there unfamiliar with the 1976 version of 8220the omen and that audience will probably be pleased with this version you certainly can do a lot worse when it comes to horror remakes 8220the amityville horror immediately comes to mind but its still not good enough to be worth your time if you must see 8220the omen  id suggest you skip the remake and go rent the original this weeks dandy is 8220dave chappelles block party b a documentary that is the first new material from the popular comedian in nearly two years set against the backdrop of a fascinating rap concert this film gives fans a dose of why the comedian has risen to such huge popularity it also sheds a little light on why he walked away from his comedy central series in the middle of filming season three in september 2004 right after signing a 50 million deal with comedy central chappelle organized a free block party that featured a combination of comedy and music in a brooklyn neighborhood the stellar roster of artists included kanye west mos def talib kweli common dead prez erykah badu jill scott the roots cody chesnutt big daddy kane and  reunited for their first performance in more than seven years  the fugees chappelle served as emcee of the event providing his trademark oneliners throughout the day and evenings festivities but 8220block party has a little more going for it with footage from rehearsals and chappelle returning to his childhood home in ohio wandering through town handing out golden tickets to invite several busloads of citizens to join the party chappelle also enlists the services of a college band which ends up providing west with a memorable entrance during his performance of 8220jesus walks while i enjoyed the concert footage the film could have easily been about the comedians return home and still been effective it shows chappelle as a guy who is maybe a little starstruck by his own success almost to the point of feeling guilty about it i was already a fan of chappelle but 8220block party made me appreciate him even more here is hoping his selfimposed hiatus doesnt last much longer  sportswritermovie reviewer micheal compton now has reviews available on the web go to  and click on the comptons critiques link for a quick hit of movies now playing in the area micheal can also be reached via email at mcomptonbgdailynewscom
Oct 19 2019,neutral, crawl 2019 given all the cinematic bloat as of late a pareddown thriller would seem to be a blessing offering nothing more and nothing less than appreciated adrenalinepumping chills it worked three years ago when blake lively stood firm against a menacing shark in the shallows but the idea goes bellyup with crawl in this one alligators are the apex predators making life miserable for the humans as college swimmer haley keller kaya scodelario and her injured father dave barry pepper are trapped in the flooded crawlspace of daves florida home while a category 5 hurricane rages all around them initially theres some tension as haley and dave are hopelessly pinned down by these critters but because the script by brothers michael and shawn rasmussen never offers much variation and because director alexandre aja never provides a proper sense of the layout of the joint all excitement soon dissipates a few hapless humans wander into the frame to provide snacks for the gators but stripped of personalities and for the most part even names their ultimate fates mean little crawl is presumably meant to refer to the movements of both the alligators and the human protagonists but it might as well refer to the forward momentum of the movie itself its solemnity results in tedium and one wishes that its makers had taken the same approach adopted by director lewis teague and screenwriter john sayles with 1980s alligator starring robert forster rip embracing the more ludicrous aspects of the premise and ensuring the humans were quirky enough to hold attention whenever the gators were mia that picture was energetic and entertaining crawl on the other hand is mostly torpid and toothless häxan 1922 those looking for something different to watch this halloween wont do much better than häxan a delirious swedish documentary from the silent era a nonfiction feature ahead of its time in the manner in which it employs dramatic recreations this finds director benjamin christensen also turning to all manner of surrealistic imagery to relate his thesis it takes a look at witchcraft during the middle ages ultimately concluding that those burned at the stake or drowned in rivers were no different than modern folks suffering from hysteria the psychological musings dont arrive until late as the majority of the picture offers background info on how superstitious people once viewed witches before plunging into eyepopping sequences in which scores of witches take to the sky on brooms and sorceresses cavort with actual demons while spitting on crucifixes and feasting on unbaptized babies the visual effects are excellent if dated but the makeup and costume designs are as impressive as anything seen in modern cinema incidentally thats christensen himself playing satan if theres an overriding message to take from this movie it isnt the connection between the witches of yesteryear and the hysterics of today  instead its the eternal evil of the patriarchy and the perennial hypocrisy of the church as leering men of the cloth are repeatedly shown torturing innocent women both young and old criterions bluray edition of häxan also contains 1968s witchcraft through the ages a shortened version of the film with added narration by william s burroughs other extras include audio commentary from 2001 by film scholar casper tybjerg christensens introduction to the film for its 1941 rerelease historical background on many of the photographs used throughout the movie and outtakes hercules in the haunted world 1961 a standard swordandsandal flick receives a shot in the arm from director mario bava just a year after he made his mark with his gothic horror classic black sunday bava who had already worked as a cinematographer on a pair of other italianmade hercules pictures here also assumes the jobs of coscripter and director and he provides the film with a certain measure of visual flair british bodybuilder reg park a threetime mr universe plays the titular muscleman whose attempt to save his beloved princess deianira leonora ruffo from a mysterious illness requires him to journey to hell alongside his companions the happygolucky theseus george ardisson and the bumbling telemachus franco giacobini hercules thinks he can trust the royal advisor lico christopher lee learning almost too late that hes the one behind deianiras condition the acting aside from lee is wooden and the script extremely choppy but the film is elevated by bavas renowned eye for atmospherics the helmer does a fine job of making the most of a low budget and his use of lighting and color is typically inspired fans of lees booming voice and who isnt will be disappointed to learn that another actor dubbed him for the englishlanguage versions in addition to the us release version kinos bluray edition of hercules in the haunted world also contains the uk version hercules in the center of the earth and the european version the vampires vs hercules other extras consist of audio commentary by author tim lucas mario bava all the colors of the dark an interview with ardisson and theatrical trailers the omen collection 19762006 while 20th century fox released an omen box set on bluray back in 2008  one which contained the original trilogy and the 2006 remake of the first film  it failed to include the series madefortv offering this definitive box set from shout factory not only houses all five films but also adds a few new extras to the generous bonus features brought over from the previous set one of the finest horror films of the 1970s the omen 1976 proved to be a monster hit placing only under rocky a star is born and all the presidents men as one of its years top grossers working from an intelligent script by david seltzer richard donner directed this for maximum impact as us ambassador to britain robert thorn gregory peck and his wife kate lee remick slowly come to realize that their adopted child damien harvey stephens is actually the antichrist several of the shocking setpieces have become legendary in their own right although they never overshadow the contributions of an excellent cast particularly david warner as a wary photographer and billie whitelaw as a demonic nanny the great jerry goldsmith deservedly won the best original score oscar with the composer picking up an additional nomination for best original song ave satani damien omen ii 1978 largely received dismissive reviews and didnt even earn half of its predecessors take but its actually the most underrated film in the franchise as with the first film a terrific cast william holden lee grant lew ayres and lance henriksen among others and some imaginatively staged demises goose this middle chapter in which a now12yearold damien well played by jonathan scotttaylor learns about his true nature from the satanic emissaries sent to protect him to its detriment the final conflict 1981 looks and feels nothing like the first two pictures in the series instead its a shoddy effort noticeably lacking in necessary tension superlative acting and topoftheline production values sam neill stars as the adult damien ready to take over the world but first requiring his minions to halt the nazarene from returning by killing every baby in england who was born at a precise time a drowsy pace and an erratic script further doom this lamentable conclusion to a fine trilogy ten years after the final conflict producer harvey bernhard who produced all three previous pictures and cowrote damien omen ii tried to revive the franchise in the chintziest way possible with a film made for network television a fox movie of the week to be exact bernhard produced and cowrote omen iv the awakening 1991 in which the antichrist returns in the form of a bratty girl asia vieira this ones strictly routine although michael lerner briefly juices up the proceedings as a lowrent detective someone eventually had the idea to remake the omen but given the mediocre results the only reason seems to have been so that the omen 2006 could be released on 6606 granted director john moore remaking the omen isnt as sacrilegious as gus van sant remaking psycho but this beatforbeat retelling takes the chilling atmosphere of the 76 model and replaces it with tiresome visual effects and laughable dream sequences the devil taking over the world is a terrifying concept yet theres so little urgency to the proceedings that youd think his master plan extended only to prank phone calls to the vatican and tping ministers houses liev schreiber and julia stiles are no match for peck and remick although the brits in the supporting cast david thewlis pete postlethwaite and michael gambon acquit themselves nicely bluray extras collected in this deluxe edition include audio commentaries on four of the five films including donner on two separate ones for the original picture a featurelength documentary on the original series interviews with various cast and crew members and theatrical trailers quartet 1981 heres a lesser effort from the team of director james ivory and producer ismail merchant best known for the oscarwinning likes of howards end and a room with a view adapted from jean rhys novel by frequent merchantivory scripter ruth prawer jhabvala quartet is set in 1920s paris and centers on the misfortunes of a young woman named marya zelli isabelle adjani married to the polish art dealer stefan zelli anthony higgins shes shocked when hes suddenly arrested for theft with stefan sentenced to serve one year in prison marya finds herself facing life on the street fortunately shes instead taken in by english couple hj heidler alan bates and his wife lois maggie smith hj immediately puts the moves on marya and its soon revealed that lois allows him to run through a succession of young woman as long as he will remain with her but matters become more complicated for both lois and stefan once marya unexpectedly falls in love with hj ivorys directorial aloofness damages what should be a torrid melodrama as the affair between marya and hj isnt believable for even one moment and the vibrant backdrop of 1920s paris frequently feels removed from the action adjani somehow won the best actress prize at cannes for her deerinheadlights performance although its smith who best conveys the desperation of her character for better merchantivory titles available like quartet on the cohen media label check out 1984s the bostonians reviewed here and 1987s maurice reviewed here
Jun 5 2019,neutral,in the world of the antichrist the original omen reigns supreme
Jan 15 2019,neutral,the film doesnt leave you with bad dreams it just makes you wonder whats the point watching this remake when dvds of the original are at hand
Feb 3 2018,positive, someone once had an excellent idea for a film to scare the pants off us what if gregory peck who represented nothing but good sense and respectability adopted a baby boy and that cute ickle shockheaded newborn turned out to be satan and satan wanted mummy and daddy dead so he could inherit everything they had  in fact ultimately inherit the earth and bring about his true aim which we call armageddon what if the only thing peck could do to stop him would be to murder him  or try to wouldnt that be a great movie well yes it would and it was the omen has been making people jump out of their skins for 30 years and now its been remade but with one crucial ingredient missing surprise to remake almost in replica a horror film that depends upon surprise is rather baffling excuse me for pointing out the obvious but since anyone who has seen the original movie knows exactly whats coming doesnt that rather spoil the shock factor an element on which lets face it a horror film rather depends its odd that the director of this remake john moore behind enemy lines should have chosen to miss the opportunity to terrify even those of us who had seen the original film he could have led us to expect the original shocks and then have delivered something new unexpected and more disturbing an audience that thought it knew what was going to happen and was then completely wrongfooted could be truly unnerved but no when i saw the original omen for the first time i saw more of the sofa cushion held in front of my face than of the television screen it would be more accurate to say i heard the film rather than saw it this time around i was so unscared that at one point i found myself wondering whether robert thorn liev schreiber was driving a toyota or a lexus not a good sign and particularly since i am a complete wuss when it comes to horror films you may say but what about people who never saw the first film well hang on just a second can the omen really have been remade for an audience which is over 18 years of age but has never seen the original thats quite a limited demographic after all the first omen has been showing at christmas and easter fairly consistently for a good many years and in any case this films target audience should be expectant parents  theyre the ones it has the most potential to spook no there are two reasons for this remake and theyre both pretty feeble one the release date is 060606  which we all know means satan and how do most of us know 666 is the mark of the beast because we saw it in the original omen movie and two we saw a gap in the marketplace says fox chairman tom rothman and with that terrifically uninspiring comment all is made clear enough of that go and see offside instead its about a group of iranian women trying to get into a football match in tehran and its marvellous with great good humour and kindliness jafar panahi the director has addressed discrimination freedom and authority in iran match day in tehran iran is playing bahrain in a world cup qualifier a young iranian woman is discovered at a stadium turnstile dressed as a boy she is taken to a makeshift pen behind the stands where a handful of women all wearing disguises are being detained by soldiers the mood is fractious the women are upset and the soldiers are bolshie no one has got what they want the soldiers are sick of being in the army and the women are tantalised by the roars of the crowd their fear of any forthcoming punishment is initially put in the shade by their frustration at missing the match the two sides begin gradually to open a dialogue courtesy of an outspoken woman who is more than a match for the soldiers she looks a lot like a bloke smokes and swears openly addresses them as equals is aggressive or wheedling by turns and argues with fierce integrity the other women plead cajole and giggle  which maddens the soldiers still further but no one is seriously angry the soldiers are trying to enforce a law they didnt make and dont really care about they know how absurd they sound and their side of the argument that women are banned because the swearing and shouting in the stadium will offend them gradually falls silent they are gently persuaded into compassionate reasonable behaviour
Jan 5 2018,neutral, all of hollywood will be watching  and not through the rear view mirrors of their beemers and bentleys but through the front window this is a great animated feature and a lot of fun  youll laugh youll cry youll get a ticket for doing 70 in a 45mileanhour zone its that kind of a movie and the real feel of the racing footage is absolutely spectacular director john lasseter who also did toy story is a cgi genius owen wilson is lightning mcqueen a young hot rod on a crosscountry trek to race in the next piston cup championship but lightning isnt so bright and he gets lost in radiator springs a sleepy tourist town thats stuck in the past where all the inhabitants are autos including paul newman who plays a 1951 hudson hornet newman is radiator springs big wheel as well as the former piston cup legend and when wilson shows him what he can do on a race course we get to see what stateoftheart cgi can do  but when wilson and bonnie hunt the porsche who loves him go out for a spin its a breathtaking jaunt and cars becomes summertime genius these cars are doing what people use to do they go for a drive id call it literature except im afraid it would scare you away the film is an elegy on the america that lasseter music composer randy newman  and even this critic  grew up in and have watched disappear i think paul newman should be nominated for an oscar the last star in an animated feature i felt this way about was robin williams in aladdin as for the omen its the least horrible horror movie ive ever seen no gore no deathdefying screams and not too many scares either it is a remake of the 1976 original and the big news is liev schreiber very good actor is starring in the gregory peck role
Aug 30 2009,negative,clunky retooling
Apr 29 2009,neutral,certainly its not the worst remake of all time but it really is one of the more ridiculous unnecessary and gimmicky of them
Apr 23 2009,neutral,while not a shotforshot copy of richard donners far superior 1976 original omen david seltzer the screenwriter of both filmsu2014barely updates his original script for this gratuitous remake

Apr 19 2008,negative,if you thought van sants psycho reshoot was weird check this out its a community theater version of that old classic the omen filled with all your favorite scenes
Dec 7 2007,positive, few movie remakes work as straight carbon copies of the originals if you want to see the same film again just get the dvd not more cinema tickets to be successful a remake should not only stand comparison to its ancestor but also bring innovation and uptodate resonance for the alreadyinformed audience hitchcock knew this when he made his second more stylish the man who knew too much and de palmas scarface brutally retailored al capone for the cocaine eighties and cronenberg teleported bmovie the fly up to speed with romance and gore now hollywood is robbing the grave of 1976s the omen the classic horror thriller that more than stands the test of time and everdiminishing sequels what has this new version got to offer the story of liev schreibers american ambassador slowly realising his young son damien is the devil incarnate is exactly the same as are all the travels dogs and deaths along the way fair chunks of dialogue are lifted too while the rest remains a bit laboured gregory peck carried it off better satisfactorily spooked mother julia stiles creepy nanny mia farrow and david thewlis mildly shambolic photographer all grapple with the script while the real star is notsocute seamus davey fitzpatrick his near silent damien with the requisite demonic stare and menacing stillness is spot on however troubled priests pete postlethwaite and michael gambon must have bet on whose hamming could chew up the most scenery with gambon coming on like comic relief its deftly stylised scenery though with lights against darks and infernal red continually clashing with religious iconography unfortunately some scissorshappy imp must have got into the editing room and snipped out the best bits the classic scenes and even the climax feel disjointed badly handled and over too quickly dispelling any tension that the subave satani score could muster saving grace comes with references to contemporary events such as 911 and palestine as satanic prophecies this omen emphasises political connections throughout and again suggests the devil will wage his war from the white house the originals still the better film all round but the disturbing resonance with the monolithic bush administration here stands up well on its own and that is pretty horrifying
Jun 15 2007,negative,will no doubt divide viewers into those who agree that it is high time that the original received so slick a makeover and those who wonder whether there is much real point to a retooling of such devilish fidelity to its source
Mar 1 2007,negative,john moores the omen is not as frightening as richard donners 1976 versionmoore resorts to scare tactics rather than impending horror
Dec 13 2006,positive,the second half of the film devoid of the cheap thrills and subliminal images that fill the first half moves along smoothly
Nov 13 2006,neutral,confirms its pointlessness at every available turn
Oct 21 2006,negative, its not like its impossible to piece together a halfdecent horror remake as recent attempts like dawn of the dead the hills have eyes and the texas chainsaw massacre demonstrated in the right hands theres plenty of scope to inject a modern spin without bastardising the memory of the original but for most studios the primary motive for remakes isnt to construct a meaningful update but rather to squeeze a bit more dosh out of an idea that made them money once before in the case of the omen 20th century fox had the added incentive that the movie could be rushed out for a muchhyped theatrical release on 6606 because who doesnt feel like a devil movie on a date like that right aside from a cursory nod to september 11th and a couple of dream sequences john moores movie sticks pretty closely to the original template with ambassador robert thorn schreiber slowly waking up to the fact that his dougheyed adopted son may be the spawn of satan but whats lacking here is any kind of wit originality or energy in its own right this is closer to paintbynumbers than a movie  really is there any point in this movies existence at all seeing that it does stick so closely to richard donners original comparisons between the two are inevitable and of course the omen 2006 suffers in every way schreiber and stiles make for woefully bland leads compared to gregory peck and lee remick hell theyd make woefully bland leads compared to ant and dec and where the original deftly blended a measured sense of pacing with shocking set pieces the omen 2006 remains plodding no matter what devilish deeds are unfolding on screen the omen 2006 isnt dreadful its slick and efficient enough theres a decent supporting cast and if you havent seen the original then it might make for passable entertainment but for anyone with fond memories of the 1976 classic this update is less of a travesty than an entirely empty experience its almost as if the devil himself had a hand in sucking out its soul theres a reasonably informative commentary by director john moore a mildly different alternative ending and a featurette about the score should you care about such things pick of the bunch though is omenisms a rather odd making of feature thats shot through with creepy lighting and an ominous score  despite the occasional muffled sound it actually creates a greater sense of unease than the movie itself then theres a ludicrous documentary about the unholy trinity of 666 and how these numbers spookily appear all around us in everyday life the lowlight is a poker champion talking of how he once pulled out a hand of like three 6s chilling
Oct 3 2006,positive,full review in greek
Sep 27 2006,neutral, in the last few years weve seen two prequels to the exorcist and a remake of the amityville horror so it was probably only a matter of time before someone got around to reviving that other popular 1970s supernatural horror movie the omen the producers of this film had an especially timely marketing hook a release date 6606 that lends itself to ad campaigns with a markofthebeast theme in other ways though the remake of the omen cannot help but seem as dated as the movie on which it is based this is partly because the new film is extremely faithful to the original composer marco beltrami does not just emulate the style of jerry goldsmiths oscarwinning score for the original movie he even reuses some of its themes and screenwriter david seltzer does not adapt his earlier script so much as dust it off and tweak a few timesensitive details for example where the first film speculated that the common market was the fulfillment of a prophecy about the roman empirea key piece in the endtimes puzzles of hal lindsey and others at that timethe new film refers to the european union instead however most of the other biblical interpretations remain as they were and they just dont sound as imminent or well ominous as they once did take for example the poem that is recited several times in both films which refers to the return of jews to zion the modern state of israel was only 28 years old when the original film came out and at that time it was alarmingly common for evangelicals to speculate that the rapture or the second coming might happen before the nations 40th birthday as one who grew up in the evangelical subculture at that time i vividly remember thinking i might never see adulthood because of this so the first omen came out at a time of great eschatological urgency today however the israeli state is more than twice as old as it was back then life goes on like it always has and if anyone has proposed a new date for the end of the world it would not seem to enjoy the widespread consensus even on a speculative level that the old date had the remake does try to create a sense of imminent dread though in one of the few significant changes to the script the new omen begins with a sequence set at the vatican in which an astronomer spots a suspicious sign in the heavens and a cardinal argues before the pope that various recent news items are fulfillments of a passage in revelation which this film quotes about as accurately as pulp fiction quoted ezekiel the destruction of the world trade center the loss of the columbia space shuttle the southeast asian tsunami the prisoner abuse at abu ghraib and so onall these things herald the imminent arrival of the antichrist five years later robert is the american ambassador to great britain and his son damien seamus daveyfitzpatrick has grown up to become a darkhaired boy with piercingly blue eyes everything seems to be going wellbut then the nanny commits suicide by hanging herself at damiens fifthbirthday party in front of all his guests after dedicating her act of selfdestruction to the boy yikes creepier things begin to happen animals react violently to damiens presence at the zoo damien reacts violently when his parents try to take him to a church for a wedding a priest father brennan pete postlethwaite shows up at the embassy claiming to know deep dark secrets about roberts son a photographer keith jennings david thewlis notices strange blemishes in the photos he takesmarks which seem to predict the deaths of the people he has photographed and in the midst of it all katherine begins to fear that she is losing her own mind on one level the omen is a story about a family and a married couple in particular crumbling under psychological stress the film works partly because it taps into every parents fear that the babies they dote on will grow up to become children who dont like them it works because it presents a worstcase scenario of what can happen when children get older and develop their own separate identities including friendships and interior lives that are not what their parents would wish for them one of the films subtler detailsits in the background of only one or two shotsis the sketchy drawing damien posts on his bedroom wall depicting his nannys suicide and what parent wouldnt be a little worried about a thing like that director john moore whose last film flight of the phoenix was also a remake does not stray far from his source though he does make a few slight changes a famous decapitation scene which the original film dragged out with slow motion and repetitive editing is handled fairly quickly here on the other hand a scene of someone being impaled by a falling spike is amplified here as the spike falls through a stainedglass window and sends the broken shards down into the body of its victim also some of the films bigger scares come from the brief nightmares that plague katherine and robertnightmares that were not in the original film moore also retains some of the original films errors in one scene jennings says the town of megiddo is south of jerusalem and that its name comes from the word armageddon hes wrong on both points megiddo is northwest of jerusalem in the valley of jezreel and the word armaggedon is actually derived from har megiddo meaning the hill of megiddo in addition the film blurs the line between what we might call a sacramental worldview and a magical worldview father brennan tells robert to accept jesus as his savior and to take communionnot so much for his own salvation but because it will give him the power he needs to defeat the antichrist later a monk named bugenhagen michael gambon gives robert seven knives which he says are the only way the antichrist can be killed he even says the knives must be used in a specific way and in a specific order and it is unclear whether the person who uses them would need to have any faith such details are of course just the usual horrormovie hooey and the new film is if anything slightly campier in this regard than the original when damien first sees the dog that hypnotized his nanny into committing suicide he waves to itand in reply the dog drips one big fat drop of drool and then there is the casting of mia farrow as mrs baylock the satanic nanny who takes over farrow knows a thing or two about demonic children having starred in rosemarys baby almost 40 years ago and her adoption of foreign children in real life is very much a part of her public personaso we are definitely meant to laugh when mrs baylock says at her job interview caring for children has been the joy of my life the times may not be as apocalyptic as they once were but this is still an omen for the age of irony the omen is rated r for disturbing violent content including a suicide by hanging an impaling a beheading an immolation a fatal injection and several attacks by dogs graphic images and some language including a few fourletter words one character also expresses her intention to have an abortion no no this has nothing to do with the child of brad pitt and angelina jolie its just another recycled big screen horror flick horror movies are so hot right now hollywood just cant stop cranking out remakes along with the originals and sure enough just in time for its 30year anniversary heres a whole new version of the omen starring mia farrow julia stiles pete postlethwaite and liev schreiber the son of satan plotline has opened the door for 20th century fox to vigorously market this new omen to christian audiences just as sony did with the da vinci code this week i received a pamphlet in the mail that was filled with bible verses that relate in some way to the omen and this tract also pointed out that the movie opens on 060606 i was not spooked david dicerto catholic news service says its skillfully crafted and wellacted and that it differs from the da vinci code in that it does not attack core christian beliefs though its horrorfilm treatment of religion is obviously sensationalized overall he finds it a fairly decent if occasionally lurid thriller its still creepy after all these years writes steve beard thunderstruck who offers excerpts from interviews with the cast and director while some will speak with condescending tones about the superiority of the original version with gregory peck and lee remick the performances of liev schreiber julia stiles mia farrow and david thewlis were engaging and spooky while the very premise of the film  will strike some as heretical or preposterous it will definitely make for interesting conversation about the end of the world as we know it bob smithouser plugged in writes here and there the omen version 6606 improves on the atmosphere of the original european locales creepy art decoration ominous ties to current events but beyond that this almost literal retelling of david seltzers story with much of the dialogue recycled verbatim will join gus van sants psycho on the ash heap of pointless horror remakes an uncredited reviewer relevant writes the story is scattered treating whichever character can induce the most fear for the moment as the protagonist this leads to little and mechanical development on the part of the storys true protagonist the diplomatboys father when his moment to become the hero arrives its empty and stiff and dont forget the massive plot holes in terms of location and events

reluctantly but ultimately as fullfledged partnerincrime in the most literal sense is street hustler coco meagan good  when juniors kidnapper crime boss meat the game demands 100000 for his freedom o2 and coco go on a bankrobbing spree to raise the cash  the heist scenes are good fun and gives good in her first major league lead a rare chance to cut loose but like the energetic action beats these more engaging if formulaic aspects are of less concern to hall than a rather heavyhanded antiviolence message  its a noble aim to have in a genre riddled with triggerhappy violenceglorifying stereotype and every now and again the message comes through effectively the juxtaposition of o2s slacker cousin larenz tate being beaten at the same site as an antiviolence rally the assembled crowd unaware of whats going on literally under their noses and best of all a scene in which o2 and coco lay bare the tragedy and pain in their pasts  but a subdued haunting memorable scene like that is the exception rather than the rule as some already lessthansubtle background news references to los angeles mayor antonio villaraigosa cracking down on crime but eventually build to some sledgehammer speechifying the frustration grows as the whole escape from the hood for a better and safer life theme takes more and more precedence over the admittedly derivative but far more effectively done aspects  the light amusement of the bonnie and clyde angle soon dissipates and one rather forced lateinfilm joke that appears in the trailer doesnt help and even the breadandbutter chases and gunplay lose their luster and urgency the ultimate showdown with meat is so abrupt and anticlimactic as if to be a mere afterthought  through it all though the cast does make the most of what theyre given

deserves and in his surprisingly scant screen time the game oozes appropriate menace  the one exception would be the junior hall the directors son who sadly doesnt display the natural performing instincts of either his father or mother kasi lemmons but all the good will generated by the appealing lead duo and the few effective action sequences is all but wiped away by a wholly expected but no

most literal sense the device allows him to pause rewind fast forward even pictureinpicture his life  the expected sandler juvenalia ensues such as the trailer moments of slowmoing the bountiful bouncing breasts on a comely jogger and pausing to move a rude kids catching arm so he could get hit in the face with a ball as well as unrelated grotesque crudeness such as his family dogs incessant urge to hump an oversized plush duck toy  as is what has become the sandler norm such crudeness coexists with schmaltz as his putupon wife a wasted kate beckinsale spending most of the film wearing sleepwear shortshorts and his parents henry winkler and julie kavner constantly nag him about the importance of family over work and so one braces oneself for the inevitable sapsoaked conclusion but

though to be charitable some of the films problems were beyond his help  the loaded casting of peck in the original film was a stroke of genius and luck as the atticus finch baggage of his traditional onscreen persona added a deeper more unsettling undercurrent to the film particularly its climax there is no comparable contemporary star whose presence wouldve had the same effect however well schreiber does here  in sticking so close to the original the role of katherine is just as thankless as it is in the first film leaving stiles as stranded and underused as remick was  also the idea of an evil demonic child is far less fresh after seeing brats routinely raise hell in both horror films and comedies raise hell the past three decades  however places where moore attempts to put his stamp on the proceedings dont compare such as the far less tense editing of the climax to more crucially his direction of young daveyfitzpatrick  where donner had his young star harvey stephens play damien fairly straight for the most part moore has daveyfitzpatrick make evil eyes to the other actors and the camera making for a winkwink quality that undercuts any attempts at scariness
Jun 24 2006,positive, it was tempting after viewing this surprisingly good remake of richard donners 1976 horror classic the omen to begin this review with the phrase well ill be damned but then i thought about it and it just didnt seem to be the wise course of action still it must be stressed that this movie had all the makings of being an amped up slambang satanic action thriller but director john moore who does not possess the most impressive résumé flight of the phoenix behind enemy lines shows remarkable restraint in terms of pacing effects there are only a handful of cgi moments and use of sound he lets the story do the talking and he captures the suffocating nature of the protagonists dilemma to paralyzing effect  the movie begins in rome where young diplomat robert thorne liev schrieber discovers that his wife katherine julia stiles has just lost her baby in childbirth father spiletto the attending priest tells robert of another woman in the hospital who died while giving birth to a healthy son and robert not wanting to break the bad news to katherine agrees to take the abandoned son as his own after an accident takes out roberts superior hello final destination and catapults robert to the job of us ambassador of england he and katherine live a relatively normal life  but as their son damien seamus daveyfitzpatrick approaches his sixth birthday the thornes witness a series of strange occurrences their nanny commits suicide at damiens birthday party her replacement mrs baylock mia farrow the mother of rosemarys baby herself takes in a rottweiler as a pet for damien without asking the thornes for permission damien all but ignores katherine who assumes at first that it is because of her failures as a mother soon however she starts to get wise and robert tries in vain to keep damien under control and his wife in the dark while enlisting the help of a photographer david thewlis who has discovered a disturbing pattern in the photographs of his subjects  the most refreshing aspect of the omen is its nearcomplete disregard for how modernday horror movies are made the creepy nightmare sequences are all shot in silence with the imagery doing all the talking instead of an overblown percussionheavy audio track telling the audience when to be frightened even the death scenes are oldschool from a cgi perspective in fact one gorefree scene will have audience members squirming this is surely due to the savvy decision to bring back david seltzer screenwriter of the original omen to update his own story if anyone knows what worked and what didnt work in the original film its seltzer and it sure as um hell doesnt hurt that he came of age in an era where the story was the most important part of a film and as a result the urge to make a splatterfest does not come naturally  newcomer daveyfitzpatrick has the coldest eyes youve ever seen though to call what he does here acting would be a stretch he has five lines tops pete postlethwaite has a nice turn as the priest who warns robert of his sons origins but no one suffers more for their art here than stiles whose katherine knows shes up against something otherworldly and evil yet cannot find the strength or courage to fight it never mind convince anyone else that it exists it brought to mind charlize therons performance as keanu reeves wife in the devils advocate the hapless female pawn of evil theres good acting to be had in those parts  i went into the omen expecting very little and walked out gobsmacked seldom is a supernatural horror movie so sly and moore filled this movie to the brim with quick jabs hidden references and otherwise unsettling visuals that may not even register on a conscious level for the fans of the final destination and saw series they may view this as a disappointment since its less about the violence than the story but if someone wants an ultraviolent satanic thriller they can rent warlock this on the other hand is horror with a soul sleep tight dvd review      a disappointingly slim offering  from 20th century fox especially given the fascinating subject  matter the featurette omenisms which begins with a disturbing story about  the film to a pivotal scene being mysteriously destroyed turns into a sterile  lengthy makingof bit thats more about the mundane nature of making a movie  than anything else indeed director john moore who also provides an audio  commentary along with his producer and editor is not at all afraid to be a  diva no matter who is filming him but omenisms holds nothing in terms of  toothlessness to revelations 666 which feels like it was made for rupert  murdochs fox faith channel the most unsettling extra is the abbey road  sessions which shows composer marco beltramis creepy score being recorded in  the most famous studio in the world you can follow us on twitter and facebook for content updates also sign up for our email list for weekly updates and check us out on google as well

Jun 24 2006,neutral, another month another horror remake though its certainly not as bad as various other entries in this burgeoning genre  ie house of wax the texas chainsaw massacre etc  the omen primarily comes off as a slowpaced surprisingly tedious update that ultimately feels more redundant than anything else  liev schrieber  stars as robert  thorn a successful diplomat who agrees to take in a homeless newborn after the death of his own baby during childbirth  though he neglects to inform his wife katherine julia stiles of the switch years later when it becomes clear that little damien seamus daveyfitzpatrick doesnt just look extremely sinister robert finds himself forced to take matters into his own hands the omens been directed by john moore a filmmaker with a distinctly bland workmanlike sense of style  as evidenced in watchable yet visually inert flicks like behind enemy lines and flight of the phoenix the movie is consequently devoid of an underlying feeling of dread with individual sequences far more engaging than the whole ie theres a terrifically suspenseful bit in which damien riding around his house on a scooter stalks his mother before going in for the kill moores decision to ape its predecessors exceedingly deliberate pace proves to be disastrous  there are long stretches within the films midsection that are just stupefyingly dull primarily due to the fact that were several steps ahead of schriebers robert thorn as such the plethora of sequences that find robert immersed in an investigation revolving around the true nature of his son cant help but come off as superfluous and  thoroughly monotonous this feeling of apathy extends to virtually every facet of the films production and there are moments in which the viewer is drawn more to the impressive set design than to the actual content of individual scenes and while the omen does improve as it progresses  that infamous decapitation is much more impressive here than in the original  theres simply no overlooking the needlessness with which much of the film has been imbued

Jun 12 2006,negative, it seems only fitting that the devils true name is seamus daveyfitzpatrick a lineal collision of such sprawling implication that the mind reels before even the unspooling of a single reel of this finely honed yet utterly pointless remake there is as im sure you already know the origin of seamus a fine old warhorse of an irish name cribbed somewhere along the line if the majority of babynaming web sites are to be believed from the english james meaning he who supplants aha clearly somethings rotten in heaven already and so we move on to davey which can only point conspiratorially i might add to that beloved series of faithbased clay animation shorts davey and goliath in which a boy and his dog not to be confused with the lq jones film version of harlan ellisons seminal postapocalypse tale a boy and his dog although really at this point why the hell not attempt to circumnavigate the serpentine coils of pixelated earlypreadulthood from there its just a hop skip and a jump over a vast lake of molten human carnage to factoring in the waytooobvioustoignore fact that davey and goliath chums to the end aired in syndicated format from 196065 which gives us um two sixes and a five plus a one which of course adds up to  wait for it  666 obviously the one the nine and the dash are erratum and should be discarded from the sum fitzpatrick well i havent had time to figure that one out yet but im pretty sure it has something to do with the word tricky the point of all this is by now lost even on me although i can safely say that the mystery of this remake of richard donners 1976 demonchild flick is infinitely more entertaining  and puzzling  than anything going on in the da vinci code the story here is an almost noteperfect reproduction of the original with some minor details cast out gregory peck for one in favor of the kind of actorly upgrades you get in nearly all remakes these days liev schrieber for two which is to say not so hot as the american ambassador to italyengland and nonsire of the antichrist schreiber musters little of pecks steely gravitas although he acquits himself admirably in any case stiles however is just plain miscast as both his wife and damiens unwitting human stepmom lee remick was 41 when she tried to raise hell and at 25 stiles is still too cheerfully coltish to believably manage the complex maternal terrors at the heart of this character this omens major and only coup comes courtesy of mia farrow as mrs baylock the antichrists antimary poppins she uses her own whippetthin frame to gleeful deviant effect having previously acted the part of catholic girlturnedsatans cheerleader farrow here achieves a stratum of selfreferential cinematic metairony thats oddly endearing to watch she plays it as straight as a scalpel on an umbilicus and momentarily puts rosemarys baby clean out of your mind momentarily apart from the showstopping thirdact demise of thewlis very nicely upping the ante on david warners original showstopping last gasp and the whole daveyfitzpatrick whatsinaname mindfuck farrows delicately crazed performance is the only real reason to rush out to see the film and it goes without saying only if youve already savored donners broodingly tawdry original a note to readers bold and uncensored the austin chronicle has been austins independent news source for over 40 years expressing the communitys political and environmental concerns and supporting its active cultural scene now more than ever we need your support to continue supplying austin with independent free press if real news is important to you please consider making a donation of 5 10 or whatever you can afford to help keep our journalism on stands

Jun 7 2006,positive, senior american diplomat robert thorn liev schreiber is called to an emergency at a nearby hospital his very pregnant wife kathryn julia stiles had a difficult delivery and according to hospital priest father spiletto the baby died at birth despondent over the loss and fearing the impact it will have on kathryn robert accepts the priests offer to replace the dead child with another born the same night little does he know that this act of compassion will unleash armageddon upon the earth in the omen the presidents godson robert thorn liev schreiber the manchurian candidate is on a happy trajectory as the us ambassador to italys right hand man and beloved husband of katherine julia stiles the bourne supremacy when he is faced with a dire decision unbeknownst to her his wife has lost their firstborn during a difficult labor a priest father spiletto giovanni lombardo radice gangs of new york suggests a white lie  the substitution of another child born within the hour of that june 6th day  and so robert offers his wife this unknown baby to her as their own setting the stage for the fulfillment of the omen david seltzer dragonfly wrote the script for the original 1976 version of this postexorcist satanic tale and gussies it up with some modern day indications of what was prophesied in the book of revelations  the challenger disaster and 911 among them but although seltzer otherwise offers an almost note for note replay of his first pass director john moore behind enemy lines the flight of the phoenix has delivered a slight improvement a film that is scarier and more unsettling the second time around the audience is clued in to something amiss well before the thorns are when a rube goldbergesque accident fells the italian ambassador just as hes about to assume a more prestigious post in london the job falls to robert and katherine responds by acquiring a magnificent estate she feels is suited to their new position when damien turns five an elaborate birthday party turns horrific when his nanny amy huck from hell eurotrip steps out onto the roof in view of all proclaims its all for you damien and plunges several stories from a noose photographer keith jennings david thewlis harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban captures everything and is at the embassy the next day to photograph the priest father brennan pete postlethwaite the constant gardener æon flux who is escorted from the premises after speaking to the ambassador in the darkroom jennings begins to make a supernatural connection that dovetails with brennans predictions and begins to convince thorn that his son may be the spawn of satan the new omen features art direction as subtle as a matadors cape yet it is effective the color red always surrounds those about to die in the devils quest for power and when thorn is shocked to discover the mark of the beast 666 on his sons scalp one wonders why hes never really noticed the pattern on the boys bedroom wallpaper katherines psychological breakdown as she begins to believe her son is evil incarnate is supported by extremely creepy dreams and stiles very effectively evokes the confusion paranoia and terror of her situation just as schreiber a terrific actor conveys the gravity of his situation the casting of a prior mom of satans son mia farrow as mrs blaycock the nanny whose references never get checked was a masterstroke and farrow is a hoot all sweetness in public the originals terrific billie whitelaw was obviously a bad guy from the get go all shining fervor in privacy thewlis is a big plus as the photographer personally motivated to assist thorn the films big weakness is young seamus daveyfitzpatrick as damien  hes creepy enough as a cutaway but too one note overall if the purpose of a remake is to bring an older film to a new audience the omen must be considered a success its real trick is to treat those who are familiar with the original to some new chills with a familiar story in 1976 director richard donner created quite a stir with scripter david seltzers screenplay about the birth of the antichrist on the earth now 30 years later helmer john moore takes that same screenplay and faithfully recreates the original in a modern yet oldfashioned retelling of the omen movie icons gregory peck and lee remick played the surrogate parents to the spawn of satan the first time around in a slick and scary tale of one mans mission to stop evil from taking over the earth liev schreiber and julia stiles reprise the roles of robert and kathryn thorn in a remake that is geared for a brand new audience that would eschew the 76 film but will readily embrace the update as i said the new omen is a blowbyblow reproduction of the earlier movie so if you are familiar with the latter you wont get anything new from the remake but the omen is a wellmade supernatural thriller that moves along at a good and entertaining clip from the shocking damien its all for you nanny amy huck suicide to the deadly dispatch of father brennan pete posthelwaite and roberts realization that he is the stepfather of satans child director moore does a solid job with seltzers original script and talented cast in making the omen a fresh telling of the rise of ultimate evil on earth schreiber lacking the baggage of fame that gregory peck brought to the original is able to envelop himself in his character thorn as the diplomat faces increasing evidence that his son damien seamus daveyfitzpatrick is anything but an innocent little boy julia stiles has the tough role as fragile kathryn who is the first to realize that something is terribly wrong with her son the supporting cast is superb with mia farrow giving a kindly turn though with a wicked undercurrent as damiens newest nanny mrsbaylock and minion of the devil she is all sweetness as she protects her unholy ward making her deadly part in the conquest of the world all the more chilling  the laughs from members of the audience over her antics had a distinctly nervous edge pete postlethwaite gives a fine performance as the priest who is trying to right the wrongs he has committed in the service of satan by convincing thorn of damiens dangerous heritage his demise is one of the slickest bits of fx in the film david thewliss as the paparazzi who joins thorn in his mission makes the original david warner role his own michael gambon is just okay in the small role as a priest who advises and arms thorn with the weapons to kill the antichrist aside from the several special fx sequences the omen is meatandpotatoes storytelling that builds its tale of the antichrist in an oldfashioned unencumbered way john moore made a solid directing debut with his exciting behind enemy lines 2001 and bellies up to the bar of his latest film with capable competence he is joined by a team of behind the camera players that help make this remake seem fresh even today older audiences familiar with the 1976 version of the omen will not get anything new with the remake but this new rendition is aimed at a new audience and provides solid entertainment on the big screen i can see the film buffs especially supernatural horror film buffs watching both films back to back just to compare the two heck id watch the first one again just to compare the two films
Jun 7 2006,neutral,i felt like i was seeing the da vinci code with slightly shadier priests
Jun 7 2006,neutral,john moores remake of the omen rivals gus van sants psycho both for its fidelity to the source material and for its utter pointlessness
Jun 7 2006,positive,this one does a little bit better job of ratcheting up the tension than the first one which at times seems a little humdrum for a horror flick
Jun 7 2006,neutral,where in the originalthe camera quickly cut away now it lingers on the carnage this isnt necessarily a sign of how much we have progressed since then
Jun 7 2006,negative,as there are no new surprises or twists the omen is mainly instructive for comparisons sake something like a survey of obnoxious modern filmmaking trends
Jun 6 2006,positive,i dont approve of remakes but the omen redux is riveting imaginative and ultimately bonechillingly satisfying
Jun 6 2006,positive, robert thorn liev schreiber is serving as a staff member under the us ambassador to italy when his wife katherine julia stiles is told she lost her baby in childbirth a priest in the maternity ward offers robert hope a child was born to a mother who died in childbirth with no family to care for it after learning that katherine can no longer have children of her own robert takes the child in place of his own and lies to his wife to complete the illusion a few years later circumstances have propelled robert to becoming us ambassador to great britain but the mysterious deaths that got him there start hitting closer to home something is very wrong in the world and roberts secretly adopted son damien seamus daveyfitzpatrick seems eerily connected to it all this remake of the omen really boils down to an outandout horror flick that pulls no punches its been a long time since each death was held on screen for every savory second impalement decapitations and one that will make your skin crawl the next time youre left alone in a hospital at the same time its a creepy thriller that showcases liev schreiber from nonbeliever to manoffaith the only question is will his character be convinced of what everyone else in the audience can plainly see will he be in time to save himself and the entire world from the son of the devil himself there are a few requisite boo scares scary image and loud sound combo but director john moore does an excellent job of leaving not only the music out but cleverly quieting the sound until at the same time you realize everything is too quiet suddenly something happens and its not blown on a throwaway besides the perfectly creepy atmosphere an above average cast harry potter alumni david thewlis and michael gambon are among damiens adversaries keeps the drama and the mystery going in spite of the fact we all know where its going did i mention that the camera doesnt pull away as the good guys are cut down like weeds its been a while since ive seen the original long enough that i wasnt sure what happened next and that may be a good thing for this particular remake the only real problem with the great setup and story is knowing it has to end and knowing how it should end and this is also where the script andor director finally trips at the finish line it doesnt take a whole lot of imagination to think of a better or sneakier way to for the good guys to thwart the bad guys but if they did you couldnt have a sequel now could you still they could have made it less obvious and allowed the characters to continue showing the intelligence they had previous demonstrated throughout so while its a good show it stops just shy at being as great as it could have
Jun 6 2006,negative, it may be 6606 but the date you should remember is 62006 which is when the original omen is rereleased as a collectors edition dvd the omen although a remake may be a cinematic first  a film whose entire existence can be attributed to a date the three 6s for which the series of films starting with 1976s original of the same name are so wellknown are given prominent placement not only in this film but in the blitzing marketing campaign this gimmick is only a microcosm of the film itself which is virtually a shotforshot remake of the original and about as unnecessary as horror remakes can be save gus van sants appalling remake of psycho this is largely jumpscare horror that is tailormade for a big opening week and then a prompt trip to the walmart bargain bin for those who havent seen or heard about movies for the past thirty years or so the film chronicles the amazingly bad luck of robert schreiber and katherine stiles thorn as the film opens katherine gives birth to a child who dies soon after robert is told of the tragedy but he cant bring himself to tell katherine because of the guilt she would have to endure this is where the infamous damien daveyfitzpatrick enters the picture as he takes the place of the dead child that katherine really thinks is hers as years pass damien never really forms any kind of connection with his parents and as his sixth birthday approaches strange seemingly supernatural events begin to take place the thorns under the wisdom and advice of numerous religious figures begin to believe that damien may be the devil incarnate screenwriter david seltzer may have topped john hughes narrative recycling job for home alone 2 with this to call this version an update is stretching it since virtually every scene is recreated to a tee because of this youd think director john moore who im still in the process of trying to forgive for 2001s behind enemy lines would try and mold the film a bit and give it a touch all his own this is not the case as he drives the film through several final destinationstyle death sequences and a whole lot of puttering through standardissue jump scares and religious mumbojumbo but the real problem arises when you put the film in perspective to the originals age scary little kids in films are a given these days  a far cry from 1976 seamus daveyfitzpatrick while slightly ominous with his messy jetblack hair and blank stare just isnt very frightening he has next to no lines and his sly smile and grimace is more likely to draw laughs than actual apprehension its not his fault its just how audiences react these days because we have been bombarded with pale evil children the rest of the performances are suitable but hardly memorable liev schreiber is clearly no gregory peck but he at least brings some depth to robert thorn julia stiles is run through the emotional gamut as katherine but there is a slight immaturity likely age on stiles part that keeps the character from being completely convincing mia farrow actually runs away with the show as mrs baylock who is actually the hellish protector of damien her nonchalant demeanor is the creepiest thing about this film regardless the omen is a wash just like so many of these unnecessary cashcow remakes just like the da vinci code the omen does not seem like a summer film but oh yeah its all about june 6 2006 it may be 6606 but the date you should remember is 62006 which is when the original is rereleased as a collectors edition dvd
Jun 6 2006,negative,ah  once again  hollywood and its remakes  why do they bother it does not bode well for a film when the audience is laughing at what is supposed to be a very serious scene
Jun 6 2006,negative,a funny thing happened the other night  i went to see a horror film and a comedy broke out
Jun 6 2006,neutral,features an alarming number of classy actors getting whacked in the most ghastly and classless of ways
Jun 6 2006,positive,if the movie didnt take itself so seriously it could have been a great popcorn muncher as is itll still work fine for those willing to forgive its trespasses
Jun 6 2006,neutral, its good that he stands out because for better or worse theres not much beyond the performances to distinguish this horror thriller from the 1976 the omen starring gregory peck and lee remick while other remakes of scary 70s movies have tossed in 21st century updates  when a stranger calls  now with text messaging  the formula here is the same bigname actors slow pace shocking deaths creepy little kid with a bowl haircut other than the obvious marketing advantages of releasing this movie on 060606 a second omen seems completely unnecessary even if it is kind of fun the setup  diplomat robert thorns wife has a stillborn child so priests replace it with another baby who turns out to be the devils son  is the same although the scenario seems even more ridiculous now anyone who has given birth in the age of hmos knows that hospitals do everything short of installing lojack in the fetus to avoid a switchedbaby scenario do you think kaiser wants 45 straight days of bad publicity on nancy grace thorn is named ambassador to england and after horrific things keep happening to people close to his son he becomes a tabloid newspaper target a seedy photographer played by david thewlis suspects supernatural forces are responsible and a mystery unravels punctuated by a series of gory chainreaction deaths young people might think the omen is paying homage to the final destination series when its really the other way around among the actors only liev schreiber in the thorn role is a disappointment giving an uninterested monotone performance that recalls christopher lambert in his prime highlander years julia stiles is much better as katherine thorn overcoming the movies jerry lee lewis casting stiles looks like shes 14 and schreiber looks 40 to bring nuances to her stayathome mom role newcomer seamus daveyfitzpatrick is outstanding as damien  immediately joining haley joel osment and those two little girls from the shining in the freakylooking kid hall of fame the producers also recruited a robert altman movieworth of great character actors including michael gambon and pete postlethwaite is there anyone other than postlethwaite who could shout the line its mother is a jackal and not sound totally ridiculous in this crowd of master thespians mia farrow elbows everyone off the stage playing a very polite but seriously imbalanced nanny who acts as damiens protector whether it was done with studio makeup and camera tricks or reallife sessions with dr 90210 farrows face is now approaching loni andersonpriscilla presley levels of waxlike immobility and what could be scarier than that director john moore plays the lightversusdark themes for all theyre worth and his visual style helps make the omen feel like a mature horror film truth be told the director uses many of the same cheapthrill techniques featured in the friday the 13th films but moore has the skills to make it look like art writer david seltzer who also scripted the original the omen makes a few huge missteps in the second try the movie is derailed early on by video of the smoking twin towers hurricane katrina damage and tsunami destruction in thailand  all described as signs of the coming of the beast whether or not its too soon to include these recent disasters in a feature film is a matter of opinion but in terms of filming a fantasy these distracting realworld images take a while to get over and even though the new omen has a nearly identical plot it is missing the best part from the original film and its sequels  that totally sweet sanguis bebimus corpus edimus chanting in jerry goldsmiths musical score which got cranked up every time damien did something particularly evil the words translate to we drink the blood we eat the flesh how cool is that the remake is a solidly crafted movie with a lot of good scares but it also raises the question why even bother with an update  advisory this film contains profanity gore and multiple themes involving murdering children anyone who is pregnant intends to get pregnant or just loves babies should not only run screaming from the omen but spend the next month watching pbs stations to avoid stumbling onto the movies commercials  if you do go try walking into tonights 6 pm showing at 606 and six seconds you might miss a trailer for snakes on a plane but people will think youre a total badass peter hartlaub is the san francisco chronicles culture critic and cofounder of total sf the bay area native a former chronicle paperboy has worked at the chronicle since 2000 he covers bay area culture cohosts the total sf podcast and writes the archivebased our sf local history column hartlaub and columnist heather knight cocreated the total sf podcast and event series engaging with locals to explore and find new ways to celebrate san francisco and the bay area
Jun 6 2006,negative,other than that beat for beat and scene for scene this is almost exactly the same film start to finish director moore completely disinterested in doing something different or intriguing to make it stand out
Jun 6 2006,negative,schreiber and stiles are fine actors but this isnt a fine script and there is nothing like pecks campy meltdown to keep us entertained and horrified
Jun 6 2006,positive,its not pulsepounding not very often anyway but it is ominous and smart and more cerebral than your average horror film in these hostel days
Jun 6 2006,negative,there seems little rationale for omen 06 except to resuscitate a brand name that carried enough popculture clout in watergates aftermath to inspire a host of gnarly sequels
Jun 6 2006,positive,the devil takes care of business in exactly the same way as if hes reading from the book of rerevelation but director john moore has added some creepy visuals and assembled an unusually strong cast for a horror flick
Jun 6 2006,negative,characters in this omen still cock their heads like confused mutts at the number of the beast cmon people has the career of iron maiden been for naught
Jun 6 2006,neutral,an unnecessary but notasawfulasyoumightthink remake
Jun 6 2006,positive,future generations can only hope something so nice happens when they get their omen revival for now theres damien part deux enjoy him kids chances are hell be around for a while
Jun 6 2006,negative,in their religious fidelity to the original director john moore and writer david seltzer dont attempt to paper over anachronisms from seltzers 1976 script
Jun 6 2006,positive,moore realizes creating an unsettling mood genuine suspense and fully realized characters is as important  maybe even more important  than mere bloodshed
Jun 6 2006,negative,its a terrible sign for a movie when the sole reason for its existence is a satanic opening date
Jun 6 2006,positive,the omen is not a bad film it just suffers in comparison to its original
Jun 6 2006,positive, my moviegeek friends and i sometimes play a game where we take an old classic flick and recast it with actors working today like if you were gonna remake star wars who would play han solo that kind of thing why would we do that i dunno  maybe its just the prospect of hearing someone like josh holloway or david duchovny saying never tell me the odds its just fun and i think director john moore played that game with the creepysilly 1976 flick the omen and i think he had a whole helluva lot of fun in the process look he got pete postlethwaite to dress up like a priest and say classic stuff like his mother is a jackal thats awesome thats pure moviegeek goofiness and maybe casual moviegoers who dont see the dorky joy of that wont find much to appreciate in this remake that they didnt find in the original but for me seeing an example of the casting game taken to fruition and up on the screen is enough of an answer to that eternal hollywood question why remake this movie now sure moore  who is building a track record of making movies that are simply popcornfun like flight of the phoenix another remake and behind enemy lines  makes a bit of an attempt to update david seltzers 1976 script for today throwing in some handwringing by the vatican over all the signs of the apocalypse that have been showing up lately like 911 and the indonesian tsunami but for the most part this is strikingly like the original film to the point where part of the moviegeek fun is ticking off the classic moments as they swing around theres the big black satanic dog theres the birthday party with the hanged nanny here comes the bit with damien screaming at the prospect of going to church oh i think i know what theyre gonna find in that grave in the italian cemetery its like the remake of poseidon from a few weeks ago only better and thats because in a weird way this omen is so much more like the original than poseidon was moore didnt mess with a classic like poseidon did  hes paying homage to it i mean no one stages hamlet if they dont love the play and not to make this omen sound heavier than it is cuz its just a cool and creepy movie but its kinda like that its not deep or important or challenging  its cinematic comfort food sometimes you want filet mignon sure but sometimes you just want meatloaf and this is really really good meatloaf with the chunky mashed potatoes and gravy made from scratch not poured out of a can i dont mean to insult this cast by likening them to diner food  they are why its so much fun waiting for all the omen moments to come around to see how theyll deal with them and why the film is still so suspenseful even when you know absolutely everything thats gonna happen every single one of them makes you go yes thats exactly whom i would have cast liev schreiber the manchurian candidate the sum of all fears is robert thorn this time around the american diplomat who out of love for his wife agrees to a secret baby substitution that saddles him with the spawn of satan schreibers one of those sly actors who can turn on a dime between genuinely profound emotion and deadpan snark and though here its mostly things like heartstopping grief and sheer terror that hes working with hes the kind of actor who keeps you on your toes never quite knowing what to expect from him and hes a lot more convincing actually as an anguished father and husband than gregory peck was in the original particularly paried up with julia stiles the bourne supremacy mona lisa smile as roberts wife katherine both schreiber and stiles are at least twenty years younger than peck and lee remick were in the original  the other major deviation moore took from 1976  which supplies one of the few new spins its all in the subtext nothing overt but now instead of an older couple and their lastchance child we have a much younger couple with different hopes and expectations from parenthood and the rest of the cast is just well gravy mia farrow the mother of rosemarys baby as mrs baylock the satantic nanny thats simply inspired postlethwaite aeon flux the constant gardener as the doomedtobeimpaled father brennan is perfect david thewlis basic instinct 2 kingdom of heaven as keith jennings the photographer who captures warnings of impeding death with his cameras who else could you possible cast in that role the kid playing damien seamus daveyfitzpatrick is like an evil little harry potter dark hair blue eyes and a malevolent pout hes hilarious evil but hilarious more fun the original damien harvey stephens appears briefly here as a reporter
Jun 6 2006,negative,for a movie packed with religious symbols the omen has little understanding of religion it arrives at spirituality backwards the devil is real so you better believe in god
Jun 6 2006,negative,maybe they should pay more attention to damiens sketch of his babysitter hanging herself instead of freaking out when he makes a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
Jun 6 2006,neutral,john moores omen still delivers some good scares here and there and it is one of the better entries in the recent spate of horror remakes but not even the antichrist can catch lightning in a bottle twice
Jun 6 2006,positive,this new omen works fine it has its own look and it plays the story straight as if this were the first time it was being brought to the screen if you havent seen the original movie this one should provide some good shivery fun
Jun 6 2006,negative,there seems to be little reason for its existence  except to take advantage of the calendar anomaly of june 6 2006 6606
