messages to give the mindless action some purpose characters new and old are endearing megaminds inherent goodness his complicated relationship with roxanne tween influencer keiko overachieving buddy chum and the slightly ridiculous gang of villains the film from the same writing team as the original peppers in some goofy lines and concepts like lord nightyknights unscary new name and his soft spot for teddy bears and flipped expressions like the bad old days and darkness fades to light this time around megamind needs to learn lessons about teamwork and valuing ones friends while keikos character gives a speech about only needing to live up to her own expectations she also delivers what must be the films cringiest clichéd line my generation was born techsavvy likewise female characters womansplaining concepts to their male counterparts is not an especially subtle theme the ideas are perhaps more obvious than in the original which might also make them a tad less

Mar 7 2024,negative, dreamworks as a studio is in a very weird place where their rival disney is having a decidedly low moment dreamworks is a mess of high and low quality releases with no seeming throughline between the movies and what they are doing with their brand this was never more true than this week when we got 2 widely diverging sequels both which nobody really asked for in the first place plus we got orion and the dark a couple of weeks ago which they dumped on netflix with hardly any publicity as if it was garbage it wasnt and who can forget last year when ruby gilman teenage kraken was treated terribly by the studio and even trolls band together wasnt given the publicity campaign youd expect with that franchise and it was terrible  everyone knows i am a big fan of the original megamind ive always felt it got unfairly lost in the wave of minions and despicable me hype even though it is the superior of the two films i even have the artbook for the original megamind i find it funny inventive with great vocal performances unfortunately dreamworks did not live up to the legacy of the original with this terrible sequel it fails in pretty much every respect and isnt even enjoyable as a cheap introduction to the upcoming megamind rules television series its admittedly tough to craft a hero story around megamind but what they come up with is so bland that the 85 minute runtime felt punishing it isnt funny and the loss of our original voicecast is not only obvious but a clear sign of a lack of investment by dreamworks i rarely use the word cashgrab but it is accurate in this instance i know some will say but its just a direct to streaming movie you shouldnt have expected much i review tv movies for a living and some of them are great just because something is cheap doesnt necessarily mean it is devoid of creativity or laughs an engaging script is very cheap if i was laughing i wouldnt care about the different voices or the weak animation heck im someone that loved son of bigfoot and that looks like a direct to dvd animated film from the outside but its actually great the fact is dreamworks took megamind and made junk and that offends me as an animation fan critic and lover of the original film how dare they if there is a franchise from dreamworks that is underrated it has to be kung fu panda i recently saw the first one on the big screen at maven cinemas and i thoroughly enjoyed it its funny and po isa very likable character in my opinion all of the kung fu panda movies have been solid and i think i even enjoyed the last one more than most i loved the story of po and his 2 dads and what it had to say now we have a 4th movie and once again theyve made a solid entertaining entry in the series in this situation po is asked to successor to him as the dragon warrior and he isnt comfortable in the teachermaster role he doesnt like change which i think all of us can relate with then he meets a fox who looks like a wolf named zhen voiced by awkwafina and they confront a villain named the chameleon voiced with gleeful abandon by viola davis this is not a plot that will surprise or blow anyone away but its sweet and entertaining i liked the way it was able to bring in the previous 3 films in both subtle and nonsubtle ways and the script provided a good mixture of laughs and sweet moments the animation and music are also up to the standards of the series i really couldnt ask for much more from a kung fu panda 4 so there you have it the crazy thing is we have another dreamworks film coming out later this year called the wild robot its wild if you enjoy my writing please support me on patreon and you will get some great perks along the way especially for things like festival coverage i cannot do it all on my own please take a look at the patreon here
Mar 7 2024,negative,the first had so much going for it and this absolutely demolishes any momentum
Mar 6 2024,neutral,the effort is mostly about making noise finding the writing unable to improve on the already low standards of the original film 
Mar 5 2024,negative, from the movies we wouldve forgot existed if it wasnt for that 14yearold billboard still hanging in suburban detroit dept comes megamind vs the doom syndicate now streaming on peacock a directtostreaming regurgitation of a piece of wannabe ip from 2010 please contain your excitement the og megamind was a mediumsized hit thanks to will ferrell and tina fey voiceovers and a release during the peak cg3d animation era it was perfectly ok enough to make a little scratch but not inspire a sequel  at least until kabletown and their megacorp ilk started plumbing musty archives for franchise revivals to fill the content menus of their moneypit streaming services mvtds serves as a featurelength launching pad for the megamind rules series and none of it retains the original voice cast because well money probably  but also possibly the catch22 situation of alist talent not wanting to touch mediocre material while the mediocre material could have been gussied up with alist talent as the one guy once said so it goes  the gist mvtds is set two days after megamind if youre keeping track and why wouldnt you be we get a recap megamind keith ferguson is a bulbousheaded alien whose subsequent social alienation turned him into a supervillain but what with one thing and another he switched sides and became a superhero standing beside him are tv newscaster roxanne ritchi laura post and his flunky ol chum josh brener who used to be called minion and theres a metajoke here about legal reasons for the name change thats both obvious and not funny because arent the despicable me minions also owned by universal the answer to that is whatever which also is the likely response to the existence of a 14yearsintheworks megamind sequel and also the movies mo yet we slog on because we must megamind is still a coneheadish sort blurting malapropisms and chum is still a strange deepsea fish in an upsidedown bowl atop a robotgorilla body  except chum wants to be promoted from lickspittle to sidekick and megamind is too thoughtless and egotistical to do it so chum quits to plunge toilets at a bleak greasy spoon and eventually uses his smarts to turn the place into a hot doughnut spot meanwhile roxanne helps megamind reorient himself as a dogooder and the plot introduces a poochiesque kid character keiko maya aoki tuttle a relentlessly upbeat social media whiz and megamind superfan who wants to join his heroic cause if any villains happen to be around keiko no doubt will instagram them to death speaking of villains in the local prison we meet the doom syndicate lady doppler emily tunon controls the weather pierre pressure scott adsit is a hypnotist mime behemoth chris sullivan is a strong guy made of lava rock and lord nightyknight patrick warburton is a big scary warrior type they bust out and wreak havoc and dont know megamind is a good guy now they recruit him to join the evil party and he doesnt say no because hes a megawuss even though his mind is mega it takes him a while to realize that he might be able to thwart their dastardly plans from the inside will megamind get over himself long enough to reunite with chum and defeat the villains no spoilers of course but the villains surely wont stay defeated since they have eight episodes of a series to populate now  what movies will it remind you of its about time megamind got a sequel  even space chimps got one whats next on the list of revivals nobody asked for shark tale too surfs up and down monsters vs aliens vs your tolerance for this junk  performance worth watching hearing none of the voiceover talent really stands out here but i guess brener seems to be enjoying himself and is a reasonable enough replacement for the original minionchum david cross  our take mvtds opens with megamind speaking directly at us and i couldnt wait for him to shut up  only 82 more minutes to go the movie is formulaic down to its molecular structure mayhemic action some worldbuilding for the spinoff series poop jokes puns malapropisms that are barely a cut above the family circus comic panel etc the animation looks like a glorified episode of paw patrol it follows a wearisome prefab plot and its characters are off the tj maxx discount rack itll blend right into the peacock kiddie menu alongside checks notes dino king boonie bears kung food jackie chans fantasia and other sausagemachine fodder you didnt know existed until now and that i mightve just made up note trick question  theyre all real the 2010 movie a passableatbest superhero spoof suffered mightily in the wake of the relatively charming despicable me which bulldozed it in the popularity sweepstakes and it continues to suffer due to a lack of creativity and the sinking feeling that none of this is anybodys vision the megamind pseudofranchise smacks of an idea spawned by marketing wonks in a boardroom hoping to generate content broad enough to appeal to everybody but especially if everybody is a potential advertiser or brandingtiein affiliate will children like it who cares the only thing that matters is if people in other boardrooms like it its definitely not art its barely entertainment and if anything ever felt like capitalp product this is it  our call megamind vs the doom syndicate is vaguely comic genrica loitering in the peacock menu just waiting for exasperated parents to turn it on and keep the little monsters entertained so mom can finally grab 10 minutes for herself and use the can in peace skip it
Mar 4 2024,neutral, from the indie darling to the tips you need for day one of the biggest games to classic cheats and codes cultured vultures has you covered when it comes to gaming join cultured vultures as we bring you some of the biggest news from the world of wrestling whether its wwe news or something from across the sea lets talk shop given that it was written by the same duo that wrote the first megamind its no surprise that megamind vs the doom syndicate has fingerprints of the charm and humor that made the original a cult film unfortunately theyre too few and far between most of megaminds sequel is a cliched bore and has so many plot holes in regards to the first film that its hard to take this seriously as a proper sequel at all in megamind vs the doom syndicate the previously evil megamind keith ferguson is no longer well evil hes now metro citys hero keeping the citizens safe and stopping villains from committing crimes when megaminds old evil group hears about this in the news though they assume megamind is only pretending to be good and pay him a visit and so megamind has to pretend to still be evil all while thinking of a way to defeat his old villain syndicate the continuity errors from the first film are astounding not a single character mentions the doom syndicate all throughout the original but megamind apparently used to be their leader the syndicate claims theyve been waiting patiently for a signal from megamind but somehow missed the events of the first film when megamind took over metro city this sequel also claims that villains have been popping up since metromans defeat but the only villains we saw in the first movie were megamind and titan and metroman was defeated very early on in the film even disregarding the continuity errors though megamind vs the doom syndicate is mostly just a slog to get through the animation is a serious downgrade from the first film and aside from one scene in the third act there are no interesting camera angles or movements either thats largely because where the first film had all these great action scenes of characters flying or controlling grand contraptions the megamind sequel doesnt actually have much for the characters to do instead its mostly just megamind doing his best to keep up the illusion of him still being evil and a predictable subplot of minion now called chum quitting his work with megamind and excelling in his new job at a restaurant the setup for this sequel feels more like a comedy than the first movie and yet the jokes also work a lot less the majority of them are pretty groaninducing especially the ones that get repeated ad nauseam and the new characters are too onedimensional to be any fun watching there are a few jokes that work here however and not just work but boast traces of the witty writing from the first film theyre not on the same level but they do show both screenplays were made by the same hands which is also evident in the way the returning characters are written megamind chum josh brener and roxanne laura post arent nearly as fun this time around  and their voice acting isnt nearly as good either  but they also dont seem too far removed from how they were in the first film and a lot of the jokes that work stem from an understanding of these characters personalities that said theyve also lost a considerable amount of their depth mostly because theyre not given a lot to do other than try and defeat the doom syndicate megamind vs the doom syndicate also serves as the pilot of the show megamind rules and because of that most of the movie feels restricted by the need to set up the foundation of a followup property there cant be any intriguing character arcs since this is mostly just a glorified prologue and what its setting up isnt compelling enough to make you want to watch the show whether it be as a pilot of a show or a sequel film though megamind vs the doom syndicate has little to offer viewers thats worth watching especially if youre a big fan of the first film some of the coverage you find on cultured vultures contains affiliate links which provide us with small commissions based on purchases made from visiting our site we cover gaming news movie reviews wrestling and much more  gamezeen is a zeen theme demo site zeen is a next generation wordpress theme its powerful beautifully designed and comes with everything you need to engage your visitors and increase conversions
Mar 2 2024,neutral, the original megamind released in 2010 was a fresh funny and heartwarming animated film with wildly imaginative visuals and alist voice talent including will farrell tina fey brad pitt jonah hill and david cross fourteen years later this new straighttostreaming flick is not fresh with derivative visuals and mostly nondescript voice talent it is intermittently funny and briefly heartwarming as though they ran the original through the washing machine a few times and then faxed it its primary purpose is to serve as an infomercial for a new streaming series megamind rules comes to your home screens this month since this generation of the intended audience was not born when the first film came out it begins with a brief recap megamind originally voiced by ferrell now by keith ferguson was a fiendish villain in metrocity which he continues to pronounce to rhyme with atrocity ably assisted by a techsavvy fish who lives inside a bowl on top of a robot body originally david cross here josh brener this character was known as minion in the original movie but is now renamed ol chum to avoid confusion with the very popular yellow minion characters from the despicable me cinematic universe when megamind created an even more evil supervillain just as metrocitys beloved supermanlike superhero decided to retire megamind found that he could be a hero and he saved the day with the help of the citys intrepid television journalist roxanne formerly fey now laura post  it is a promising setup as megamind has to reorient himself to consider the value of helping others and figure out what to do with the bad guys who used to be his colleagues as the movie begins he is going after a gang of criminals who dress as fish though he takes a moment to say almost wistfully even admiringly its something the old evil me would have done back in the day he sighs sometimes i miss the simplicity of the bad old days he misses even more when the previously devoted ol chum leaves because megamind refuses to promote him to sidekick by himself megamind is not even able to figure out how to use his toaster and then his former gang the doom syndicate breaks out of prison and he must find a way to convince them that he is still evil while he figures out how to recapture them before they can proceed with their evil plan he persuades roxanne to pretend to be his fiancée and partner in crime and keiko maya aoki tuttle a smart brave young girl who knows all about newfangled ideas like livestreaming and social media shows megamind that he can accept help from others ol chum has his own adventures in a diner but comes back to join the team as well the doom syndicate includes a french mime a fiery rock monster a former weather forecaster who can control lightning and a gothy guy who has just changed his name from lord knight to lord nightynight and carries a stuffed teddy bear called mr cuddly snuggles as this suggests the film reassures its young audience by making the bad guys and action scenes more silly than scary along with the everpopular poop and barf comedy it is less successful at understanding its intended audience when it comes to some of the verbal humor not clever enough to entice parents to watch with their children just out of touch by a generation or two really jokes about the titanic movie simon and garfunkel lyrics from the 60s and nose hair clippers even more recent references are unlikely to land with elementary schoolers when the doom syndicate puts on a block party the night before the big plan will go into effect megamind complains that he is the victim of an impromptu rager urges the partygoers to use coasters and then tells the dj to put another stanky groove in my pocket there are lessons about bullying and teamwork and megamind learns that what separates the good guys from the villains is concern for the safety and feelings of others theres also a very brief mention of the importance of voting and the power of democracy and good candidates but compared to the original or to more recent films like boss baby and the bad guys it is slapdash and lightweight
Mar 2 2024,negative, its been 14 years since dreamworkss least successful film of the 2010s megamind hit theaters typically poor box office performance spells doom for an animated film series however in the early days of the superhero movie craze megamind defied expectations the film would go on to garner a cult following through the power of the internet when you have a devoted fan base the last thing you want to do is let them down unfortunately thats precisely what megamind vs the doom syndicate does the original film offered a clever take on the superhero genre with its heart and colorful characters under eric fogels direction megamind vs the doom syndicate feels more like a drawnout trailer for peacockss new animated series based on the franchise megamind vs the doom syndicate continues the journey of megamind an intelligent alien supervillain after defeating his nemesis metro man megamind creates a new hero to fight however he must step in to save the city when his creation becomes an even greater threat just two days after the events of the first movie megaminds ego is as inflated as ever within minutes of the opening you can see that this is going to be a rough ride megamind returns to belittling his sidekick ol chums formerly minion contributions reminiscent of every boss who undervalues their employees efforts this leaves ol chum feeling unappreciated prompting him to strike out on his own after being denied a promotion to sidekick by megamind meanwhile roxanne ritchi feeling stagnant in her career is inspired to do more after meeting keiko morita maya aoki tuttle the megamind fan club president despite helping megamind save the city roxanne somehow feels inadequate next to a middle schooler with a large social media following its jarring how quickly these characters regress after the progress after only two days since the events of the first film megaminds former villain colleagues lady doppler emily tunon lord nightyknight talon warburton pierre pressure scott adsit and behemoth chris sullivan doubt his transformation into a hero as the former leader of the doom syndicate they believe this is just the next step in megaminds grand schemes when they confront megamind about it plot details emerge that a younger viewer likely wont care about meanwhile adults who watched the original years ago will likely scratch their heads at the dialogue and character choices roxanne finds it surprising that megamind has connections to other villains she acts as if she is still learning new things about megamind all of this despite the fact that it hasnt been two days since they saved the city further in an attempt to build tension it is revealed that lady doppler and roxanne ritchi know each other leaving lady doppler as the only one who is suspicious of megaminds true intentions instead of standing up to his former colleagues megamind continues to play along as the doom syndicate the villains want to go on a crime spree before enacting phase 2 of their master plan which looks to transport metro city to the moon this is difficult for megamind as he has changed his mind on the villain lifestyle its harder still now that he is alone without chum there to help him this prompts megaminds character journey of learning how to ask for help to defeat the villains its surface level compared to the depths the original megamind reached when subverting expectations about what a superhero movie can look like the movie attempts to reach those same depths but never quite meets the mark ol chum as much as megamind goes through his own journey the former minion looks to find an understanding of his worth separate from megamind however since his character is largely sidelined to work at a donut shop that is never really explored instead we get a woeisme style attitude throughout with megamind having to solve the problems he created as the film progresses it makes him more and more unlikable it walks back on his growth since defeating tighten in the first film it makes me wonder who this movie was for as it is its little more than a glorified promotion for the continuation television series whats most disappointing is that megamind vs the doom syndicate doesnt capitalize on its voice cast in addition to the doom syndicate keith ferguson as megamind laura post as roxanne ritchi and josh brener as ol chum do their best to salvage a lackluster script that is more focused on puns and jokes than any real commentary voice actor changes are nothing new for animations that follow the first films kung fu panda and how to train your dragon have had very successful animation runs following their film releases without using the original voice cast for the most part this movie is passable in this department and not the distraction i thought it would be without will ferrell tina fey and david crosss recognizable voices despite this the plot tries to introduce characters that are the main focus of the television series unfortunately this makes all the dialogue very surfacelevel with so many new faces further the film never pays off on the career existential crisis commentary that the film began with i came in hoping for the same kind of clever plot with the subversion of expectations that made megamind a fan favorite instead it lands as a content farm on an established ip the result is a lifeless followup while the villains are colorful and the keiko morita introduction is a great way to bring in a younger audience none of these characters get a chance to shine or grow at least not in this film as viewers are expected to hit play on megamind rules directly after the credits roll on megamind vs the doom syndicate this is painfully evident when the end credits song is the opening of the television series while megamind learning how to be a hero while battling villains as a concept for the series makes sense it is lazy and disingenuous of dreamworks to have this project be just a glorified hourandahalf trailer for the show ultimately megamind vs the doom syndicate plays like a surfacelevel madefortelevision movie the goal is clearly to transition viewers over to the franchises new animated series while this approach has worked for dreamworks in the past this time they are ten years too late to capitalize on the following megamind has while the film boasts a strong cast there is a clear lack of depth in the plot this leaves it disconnected from all the things that made the original so great in a time with so many great animated films and series of new ips spend your time with those and skip megamind vs the doom syndicate megamind vs the doom syndicate plays like a surfacelevel madefortelevision movie the goal is clearly to transition viewers over to the franchises new animated series while this approach has worked for dreamworks in the past this time they are 10 years too late to capitalize on the following megamind has i am just a guy who spends way to much time playing videos games enjoys popcorn movies more than he should owns too much nerdy memorabilia and has lots of opinions about all things pop culture people often underestimate the effects a movie an actor or even a video game can have on someone i wouldnt be where i am today without pop culture satoru gojo is the heart of jujutsu kaisen season 2  now heading into cour 2 here is everything you need to know about the character 
Mar 1 2024,negative, it sounds like a perfectly good setup for some superhero shenanigans after defeating a nemesis of his own creation the reformed archvillain at the center of 2010s megamind returns finding himself in the crosshairs of his former allies while struggling with his new role as metro citys protector but unfortunately megamind vs the doom syndicate never quite realizes its full potential maybe thats being saved for the tv series megamind rules thats launching simultaneously on peacock instead this longawaited sequel is a pale imitation of its predecessor bringing very little to the table the straighttostreaming sequel is doomed from the start its disjointed script squanders plenty of opportunities for laughs and costumed capering megamind vs the doom syndicate doesnt quite seem to know where the original films humor comes from megamind took some big swings with a wondrously overthetop will ferrell voicing laserfocused jabs at comicbook clichés that form the backbone of a wellmade parody this time around however megamind just isnt up to scratch its telling that none of the original voice cast have returned sure it would have required a miracle to get ferrell tina fey brad pitt jonah hill and david cross back in the recording booth for a lowbudget sequel unfortunately their chemistry cant be replicated either and while the new voice cast puts in a decent effort its just missing that special something  the seemingly effortless back and forth between ferrel and cross for instance keith ferguson is riotously hammy as megamind himself but ferrell is a tough act to follow  ferguson never quite reaches the comedic heights of ferrels overenunciated vowels and cackling monologues elsewhere megamind vs the doom syndicates voice casting is pretty soso josh brener takes over for cross as minion who has been renamed ol chum for lets just say despicable reasons and does an admirable job as megaminds fishy sidekick but theres minimal spark between ferguson and the silicon valley alum or any of the cast for that matter and this falls apart even further when it comes to reporter roxanne ritchi now voiced by laura post  the willthey wontthey tension between megamind and roxanne is all but gone and a bland performance from post leaves little room for emotion megamind may have gotten the girl but now the poor guy has no idea what to do with her this too feels like a missed opportunity  one that isnt played for laughs but instead simply comes across as a flawed misunderstanding of the original film or worse still a change of direction that makes no sense relegating roxanne from love interest to another dear old chum then theres the doom syndicate itself  a ragtag band of evil miscreants that range from bland to slightly less bland sure their squabbling and bickering over leadership of the group injects a shot of wellneeded humor into the movie individually however theyre just not very original pierre pressure voiced by scott adsit is too close a match for the incredibles villain bomb voyage and it only gets worse from there a generic lava monster a dark knight and a garish version of xmens storm round out the team with designs that would look more at home in an episode of pj masks then theres the teams motivation it seems as though the doom syndicate lacks direction and their evil plot is as well thought out as lets do something evil why because its so evil again this simply falls flat turning these twobit villains into twodimensional caricatures its a shame really megamind played fast and loose with superhero standbys  secret identities extraterrestrial origin stories and the like  to create something that may not have been hugely novel but was at least entertaining no such luck here megamind vs the doom syndicate is a superfluous sequel that would be destined for the bargain bin if it ever made the leap from streaming to dvd the overthetop antics of the original are out as is the original films cast only to be replaced by an approximate facsimile thats not quite good enough the doom syndicate itself wrestles laughs some thanks to their bickering but the heart and soul of megamind has been lost in this pale imitation despite a handful of decent performances megamind vs the doom syndicate sets up a riotous romp through superhero cliché but simply fails to deliver
Mar 1 2024,negative,  one of the things that set the title character megamind apart in the 2010 animated film was that his limited wits made him funny and kind of helped you root for him throughout the story the sequel which is coming out way later than one would expect is tasked with showing megamind as a fullblown hero with a villain background as well as what that implies for metro city inhabitants and the protagonist but even just a few minutes in it becomes clear that megamind vs the doom syndicate has no idea what to do with any of its characters   picking up only two days after the events of megamind the sequel centers around the villainturnedhero voiced this time by keith ferguson learning to come to terms with his new identity his life gets difficult when he is visited by the doom syndicate his former team that still thinks that megamind is a major villain who is devising a master plan to take over mega city meanwhile he deals with three allies who are trying to become some form of sidekick to the new hero   the first headscratcher from megamind vs the doom syndicate is that youd think theres a reason for the creative decision of having virtually no time since the events of the first movie it would make sense if the story focused on megamind acclimating to his new superhero role and the sort of ethical decisions that come with the title but theres none of that here of course we cant always expect very complex storylines from a kids movie but even despicable mes gru managed to have a lessthanbasic journey from villain to hero also the first megamind was a wildly entertaining ride that had fun with superhero vs supervillain tropes while the sequel barely seems to know how to construct a story   in megamind vs the doom syndicate the stakes are surprisingly low while the title character struggles to protect his secret from his former friends the group of villains never pose a real threat because they spend a good chunk of the movie waiting to see megaminds nonexistent evil plan come to fruition meanwhile its never really clear why megamind holds on so strongly to the façade that hes still a villain in the hands of more skilled screenwriters that could make a pretty good conflict andor identity crisis that formed the core of the story but here it is just a stalling technique to make the movie longer than a tv episode   at the same time it would be better if megamind vs the doom syndicate was advertised as the extended first episode of the companion series megamind rules because the production values certainly reflect it for a feature film megamind vs the doom syndicate has a pretty underwhelming style with lifeless production design and simple character looks that certainly dont help the story come alive in the era of gorgeouslooking animations like spiderman across the spiderverse and the super mario bros movie megamind 2 falls flat even if you lower your standards and compare it with productions from the 2010s which would be more or less when this new story takes place   it doesnt help that megamind himself suffered a change in his voice you wouldnt expect the personality of a character to be modified when the voice actor gets swapped but this is what happens here when he was voiced by will ferrell megamind had a fresh excitement to his tone that also hid a desperate attempt to be accepted with ferguson all of that is gone along with the strong accent and the fact that only a couple of days passed between movies makes it seem like megamind changed personalities altogether in the blink of an eye   the same is true for the supporting characters voices and individual storylines roxanne laura post wants to do more than report catastrophes in mega city but alan schoolcraft and brent simons script has no idea how to make the connection between where she starts and where she ends in the movie in fact her ending comes as a bit of a surprise and out of nowhere additionally ol chum josh brener wants to prove his worth and that leads him to part ways with megamind but we never really see a journey for the character and it seems like the movie just waits it out to put them back

theres a whole slate of fans of the original who are now older and the sequel offers them nothing this would all be fine if the movie focused instead on being funny but aside from a quip now and then megamind 2 is devoid of humor   with vaguely established threats and storylines megamind vs the doom syndicate is the movie equivalent of meeting a friend you missed for many years only to realize that the encounter didnt really need to happen the movie does serve as an introduction to megamind rules  especially due to the final scene  but its hard to imagine that peacock didnt just take some
