Oct 5 2023,positive, the pump has been primed for a return to the shrek universe with a lively sequel to 2011s puss in boots are there sufficient numbers of fairy tales that havent already been mined for laughs in the four shrek movies yes it took over a decade for dreamworks animation to return to the franchise that built it shrek flamed out after four films but its the spinoff puss in boots that spawned this latest incarnation bringing back stars antonio banderas and salma hayek as the titular puss in boots and kitty softpaws respectively we learn that puss has squandered his nine lives by living recklessly and only now that hes on his last life does it begin to sink in just how risky his lives and attitude have been after seeking refuge with a cat lady and meeting the overly sweet therapy dog perrito harvey guillén he learns of a fabled fallen star that will grant one last wish to the person who gets there first hes not alone in his quest as goldi florence pugh and the three bears olivia colman ray winstone samson kayo kitty and big jack horner john mulaney are also after the star all deliver strong vocal performances creating a rich aural tapestry against which the mostly strong animation can stand out the narrative is densely packed but easy to follow and filled with the kind of laughs that once made shrek shrek 2 and puss in boots such highlights in their respective years of release guillén is the standout in this cast the films biggest issues come down to the choice of animation techniques for fight sequences which makes the events feel a little choppy and overly stylized like weve shifted from a traditional computer animated film to a 2d japanese anime picture those sequences are brief and the amazing animation that surrounds them offsets a lot of those concerns its surprising that a character that has been shelved for so long in spite of the netflix series could still prove to be so delightful after all this time in a sea of imitators and the fading of luminaries disney and pixar its nice to see some studios still trying to reach for the stars goldilocks and the three bears provides the characters and a few sight gags for this film alongside the nursery rhyme little jack horner all of them get fleshedout treatments that feel more like a part of the shrek universe than the stand alone zorroinspired puss in boots series yet it feels like a natural extension with the last wish and thats enough to keep the franchise buoyant for the foreseeable future
Aug 16 2023,positive,puss n boots 2 is a shockingly phenomenal movie tackling much deeper themes than one would expect from a kids movie 
Aug 9 2023,positive, puss in boots the last wish grade b this film is so good that your last wish should be that puss in boots tales have at least nine more cinematic lives puss in boots  as perfectly voiced by antonio banderas  is living the carefree life of a scallywag hero he has brazenly faced death so many times that he has gone through eight of his nine cat lives the only way to protect his one remaining life is to go into retirement and hiding at the home of a very zealous cat lover the script by paul fisher the croods a new age has all of the basic elements that make this a fun film on a very elementary level while at the same time weaving in a very smart and sensitive story about life choices it is designed that both young and old should find the tale equally as enjoyable banderas was always a great selection as the voice of puss in boots because of the swashbuckling tone he brings the tabby hero sounds like a defender of men and a lover of women the voice talent is flawless and the story emotionally solid but it is the animation style that truly elevates puss in boots the last wish director joel crawford the croods a new age takes the solid computer generated visual style of dreamworks animation and gives it a jolt by blending both 3d and 2d the overall look is the detailed 3d approach that has been used throughout the shrek franchise but crawford blends in the kind of 2d cgi style that has movies such as spiderman into the spiderverse so popular after more than two decades the shrek franchise could have become very stale instead puss in boots the last wish proves that with a smart script a great voice cast and a fresh approach to the animation it is possible for a production that comes way down the line to be superior to anything that has come before it in the franchise resident alien season two grade b the cable series based on the comic books created by peter hogan and steve parkhouse continues to shine because of alan tudyk his work is a close encounter of the hilarious kind he plays harry a crashlanded alien who takes on the identity of a smalltown colorado doctor he slowly begins to wrestle with the moral dilemma of his secret mission on earth most of the success comes through tudyks work that includes the challenge of showing how an alien would react to suddenly having to deal with a human body then there is the alien language that would have left many tonguetied magic mikes last dance mike channing tatum is recruited to stage a dance production in london will be released on dvd and bluray on april 18 a man called otto tom hanks plays a widow who is looking for an emotional escape but must first deal with a new neighbor will be released on dvd and bluray starting march 14 to have a successful garden you need to know when it is the best time to plant here are the best plants to start in may
Aug 6 2023,positive, shrek is a film cultural phenomenon and bizarre internet meme that has pervaded every crevice of the modern popular zeitgeist from bumbling toddler to cynical adult the animation wonder has nothing but adoration both earned and misguided hurled at it it not only challenged the notion of what cgi animation could accomplish but demolished the mold of what childrens movies could be cleverly subverting classic fairy tales with bracing irreverence the farting utterly vulgar ogre revived the floundering dreamworks animation catapulting them from the pits of oblivion overnight shrek 2 introduced the alluring zorroesque and antonio banderasvoiced puss in boots the swashbuckling dartagnan hatsporting ginger tabby cat became an instant fan favourite garnering his own spinoff movie in 2011 soon after the main shrek quadrilogy concluded with a thud puss in boots the last wish is a longawaited sequel that could have easily coasted off its recognizable property to a handsome box office return instead dreamworks and director joel crawford refused to play it safe crafting one of the most cathartic animated experiences in recent memory brimming with inventive ideas and kaleidoscopic visuals the last wish not only injects vigour into the longdormant shrek franchise but is one of the greatest films of the year period the fearless puss in boots banderas as silkysmooth as ever is synonymous with laughing in the face of certain death spending the better part of his nine lives performing deathdefying feats all of which are gloriously showcased in the raucously gorgeous opening not concerned with being on his last life he comes pawtopaw with a foreboding wolf wagner moura a cloaked bounty hunter with two short scythes who has meticulously waited for puss to be on his final life bested for the first time puss flees towards retirement settling into a cat ladys home and languishing in the mundanity of domestication rendered as a great homage to apocalypse now he comes across the existence of a legendary wishing star that fell to earth eons ago when hes accosted by the cockney goldilocks florence pugh and her family of bears ray winstone oliva colman and samson kayo alongside the showstealing impossibly naïve dog perrito harvey guillén and his old flame kitty softpaws salma hayek the three embark on a journey to find the star and reclaim a fresh batch of new lives all the while vying against the wolf goldilocks bears and the villainous sorceryobsessed big jack horner john mulaney the plot has all the makings of a familiar adventure and in its framework it absolutely is however its execution separates it from its maudlin contemporaries utterly dripping with style this swashbuckling adventure enters the domain of the aweinspiring with pure visual potency painting its great lesson on appreciating the life we have now with an ingenious emotionally invigorating brushstroke the dazzling animation excels on all fronts creating depth with both its astonishing world and multifaceted character design from the nuanced utterly frightening wolf to the grizzled huntresslike goldilocks to pusss visage of inner turmoil each character is imbued with noticeable layers the last wish not only continues the franchises jocular amalgamation of popular fairytale characters but underpins it with a surprising level of maturity fearlessly provoking its young audience into heavy conversations surrounding death fractured families and shattered trust the sheer assortment of fantastical personalitiesall varied eclectic and wholly interestingare never wasted each satisfyingly fulfilling their own arcs in service of a greater one goldilockss reason for pursuing the wishing star is markedly unexpected yet fits the narrative with grace while the irredeemable and feckless big jack horner transforms his famed nursery rhyme into a stark motivator the wolf is a vividly realized personification of death whose piercing red eyes and ominous whistle unearth pusss deepseated fear of the inevitable every time he appears from the shadows even characters like the scrupulous talking cricket make an indelible imprint despite their brief time on screen the evershifting transmogrifying world serves as a wonderful playground for the dynamic propulsive action setpieces straying from the more realistic style of its predecessors the storybooklike animation revels in unbridled creativity not satisfied with just one domain the studio brings forth a bevy of environments that morph from perspective to perspective colliding onto themselves and transforming into something else entirely and even more staggering the result is equally treacherous and resplendent wringing everything possible out of its familiar concept the last wish is a rare animation marvel that astonishes with its visual prowess while deftly delivering mature lessons to a young audience from the complex character design to its transportive worldbuilding the films stellar multitudinous quality coalesces in a wholly cathartic finale though the ultimate route is predictable the numerous shifting pathways and transformations are what make it truly memorable come for the cute cat stay for the deceptively deep character
Jul 25 2023,positive,fantastic exhilarating action phenomenal animation perfect voice acting  an argument could be made for the best animated film of 2022 
Jul 25 2023,positive, over the years dreamworks has lost its notoriety for being an animation powerhouse scrapping its allages edgy stories in favor of appealing to younger audiences  the original fanbase of the animation studio is now adults and it seems like they havent hit the right chord to usher in a new generation of fans it has been 11 years since the first puss in boots and the shrek franchise that ended in a flop but is still relevant in internet memes it has taken a decade for the dreamworks team to revisit the world of far far away in a longawaited sequel that revamps the entire shrek franchise through antonio banderass swordslinging cat  immediately jumping back into the world of puss in boots the film gives the perfect reintroduction to the spanish cat that feels like reconnecting with an old friend the new animation style is in full effect with destruction and festivities  picking up a few years after the first film puss finds himself  at the top of life until he is hit with an existential crisis when he learns he has one life left  for the first time in his life  the invincible puss is now fearful of death as it follows him around in the form of a wolf   to keep a low profile puss moves into the stray cat haven of mama luna where he will waste the rest of his last life as an actual cat  hope is brought to him as he discovers there is a wishing star that will allow him to get his life back if he finds it he is not the only one hunting down the star a collective of characters including goldilocks and the three bears and big jack horner chase after him  add in pusss old flame kitty softpaws to further complicate his task  puss kitty and a scrappy dog perro join forces to embark on a vibrant journey to get the star before their enemies do puss in boots the last wish is the literal wishing star dreamworks has needed to fill the large gap created by its popular franchises ending  waiting over a decade to continue the story of puss and his world was well worth the wait because this sequel delivers in every aspect one of the most notable improvements is the animation style that is an into the spiderversification of shrek with its changes between 24 and 12 frames to match the confidence of puss  the new style embodies the essence of who puss is and allows it to take on a western style fitting the story of an aging hero facing death perfectly two styles of animation are combined 2d handdrawn and cg that blend seamlessly together this change makes the animation feel so exciting to watch as well as allows more creativity for the filmmakers behind the story to take the iconic character to gorgeous landscapes audiences havent seen before  it is very comic bookesque that puts its audience right in the middle of the action through dynamic camera movement   the darkness of the film makes it an outlier of dreamworks animations filmography by showing a visualization of the terror that haunts puss  the entire film is a gift for visual storytellers to pick up on different gags and details on multiple watches  animated films have been lacking recently with casting nonvoice actors into leading roles puss in boots the last wish successfully avoids this by bringing back antonio banderas who has never been better  he adds new layers to his character as he is experiencing emotions for the first time in his life there is a sequence where puss has a panic attack about his destined fate and it is handled with so much empathy by banderass voice choices mixed with the imagery  the new mix of characters from florence pugh john mulaney and olivia colman are the perfect castings as they can bring their personalities into their roles that fit the context of the story  for having so many characters the script fleshes out each villain giving them their moments to shine whether its goldi and her family or the wolf and puss there is a lot of depth in these character decisions jack horner is a traditional bad guy but everyone else is given a chance for the audience to understand their desires or care for them  11 years was well worth the wait for this animated masterpiece about making the most out of our lives and spending time with those we love  this has become the blueprint for how to do an animated sequel that is not lazy but has heart and purpose it is easily toptier dreamworks that will work with any age of moviegoer with its smart but not intimidating nature 
Jul 24 2023,positive, this story is a fairytale reads the opening title card of puss in boots the last wish the spectacular adventurer puss in boots antonio banderas has returned to the silver screen his life is as glamorous as one would expect for a swashbuckling feline but all of that comes crashing down when a doctor anthony mendez tells puss that hes burned through eight of his nine lives puss hears of the famed last wish a special fallen star that can grant one wish hot on his trail are other famed fairytalecharactersturnedvillains goldilocks florence pugh her three bears olivia colman ray winstone  samson kayo and jack horner john mulaney luckily puss wont have to go on this journey alone accompanying him are an old friend kitty softpaws salma hayek and a new one perro harvey guillén the animation magically mixes the 3d style dreamworks is known for with stunning elements of paintlike brushstrokes by no means does this make puss seem lifelike but the strokes add warmth to the animation the characters arent sleek smooth or perfect theres a rustic quality to the illustrations that proves puss in boots the last wish is here to tell a different story something to separate itself from the rest of the dreamworks portfolio and create a new style all its own like puss own selfrealization the film and its titular character come into their own and stand far from the shadows of their origin  of course the film is geared toward children and theres a heartfelt message woven throughout the journey of puss kitty and perro the trials and tribulations of their travels are reminders of whats important in life its about friends family and love and always has been there are some throwback jokes to puss signature pouty look and physical comedy that will surely delight the kids somewhat surprisingly puss in boots the last wish also has its creepy moments throughout the entire journey to the last wish puss is stalked by the big bad wolf aka death wagner moura the wolf is a looming force with bright red eyes who will not stop until he catches up to puss the audiences hair will stand on end just like puss in the scene that introduces the big bad wolf its the first time in the shrek cinematic universe that this character is afforded the darkness of its fairytale origins puss in boots the last wish is the lastminute surprise of the year the film has all the charm the audience has come to expect from the shrek standout but with a blindsiding amount of heart and humor
Jul 14 2023,positive, puss in boots the last wish now on netflix was the first movie in the shrek franchise in more than a decade and by all means should be nothing more than forgettable piffle for sixyearolds but for the first time since donkey first cracked wise and shrek first cracked a fart one of these movies is actually about something and reaches a nearpixar level of substantive achievement to boot but unlike pixar this thoughtful kittycat adventure doesnt prompt us to weep and dribble snot like mad which frankly has been getting a bit old no this puss hits the sweet spot between thoughtful and delightful  something nobody expected in the least the gist warning pending exposition this story is a fairy tale reads a title card so i can lead off like so once upon a time an actual star fell from the sky and created a dark magical forest and within that star was one wish to be granted to whoever might find it end exposition and now to the adorablekitten crap the inimitable puss in boots antonio banderas as ever isnt just a hero of legend and mancat if infamy but a bonafide celebrity who can walk into a room and sing jaunty tunes and just be his own gigantically egotistical self then devour the adoration like a wolf to a pile of bbqed sheep his latest party is interrupted by a giant made of stone and moss and antlers and malevolent whimsy and upon besting the towering beast with his pointy cutlass and pointier wit puss takes a bow and gets his bell rung by an actual bell dong it fell and now hes dead but dont worry cats have nine lives yknow puss awakens and the doctor asks him to county how many hes spent  there was the time with the bulls in pamplona and the other time when he cheated while playing poker with dogs a drunken test of whether cats always land on their feet etc theyre adding up quickly so quickly hes on his last life cue the ohshit moment and therefore puss pauses for a moment of selfreflection which is something he really aint good at hes drowning his sorrows in a glass of the heaviest cream when a bounty hunter approaches him hes always got bounty hunters on his butt  blame notoriety and a little ethical compromise for that  but this ones different its wolf wagner moura who appears with red eyes and a hooded cloak and a pair of sickles and its pretty clear who he really is you know the big d and for the first time in his lives puss is terrified and runs away from a fight all this is actually kind of funny in an existentialhorror kind of way and also in a cutecatactinglikeacutecat kind of way i mean he gets drunk on heavy cream its a balancing act anyway puss buries his hat and boots  the legend the whole persona  and runnofts to the home of mama luna davine joy randolph a crazy cat lady wholl adopt any stray puddy who knocks on her door she puts mittens and a bell on him and names him pickles and hes mortified and depressed and grows a big long beard but at least he makes a pal in a chihuahua disguised as a cat nameless but soon to be known as perrito harvey guillen this is about when the plot really starts losing its mind because a crime family consisting of goldilocks florence pugh and the three bears olivia colman ray winstone and samson kayo wants the bounty for puss and this is when the fallen starwish exposition makes itself relevant because everyone here decides to quest for it competitively and puss motivation is hell wish for his nine lives back so he can resume being his old self it aint gonna be easy because big jack horner john mulaney and a bug that looks a lot like jiminy cricket kevin mccann and puss old nemesis kitty softpaws salma hayek pinault join the fray making sure this all gets very complicated much to our delight what movies will it remind you of rango it reminds me of rango and yes thats intended to be a compliment one hell of a compliment performance worth watching hearing far too often celeb voice work in animated films is little more than a marketing tool hoping to lure us into the theater to hear i dunno woody allen voice an insect or whatever with underwhelming results but as the voice of puss banderas has true spirit and character and gives one of the more lively voiceover performances in recent memory  memorable dialogue wolf confirms our suspicions about his identity i dont mean it metaphorically or rhetorically or poetically or theoretically or in any other fancy way im death straight up and ive come for you puss in boots our take the last wish is ingenious in many ways the character dynamics are richly layered with puss and softpaws cynical mefirstisms countered by perritos pure heart goldilocks and the bears struggle to find happiness you know something thats not too hot or too cold but just right and jack horners concupiscence for power and fairytale artifacts a neverending desire for more more more that has incurably corrupted him they all fight over a treasure map to the fallen star that offers everyone a different path through the forest shifting its physical reality into psychetraps for all parties  and this is where puss stares down his mortality and wonders if he truly values who he is what hes done and where hes headed heady stuff sure but not always and definitely not quite on the nose director joel crawford and codirector januel mercado take pains to make everything accessible to all audiences a fairy tale with some classical grimm underpinnings the script is consistently funny foregoing the snarky selfskewering that defined the shrek franchise swapping it for a more timeless sensibility consisting of whipcracking oneliners and characterbased comedy although the references are still intact  keep your eyes peeled for nods to t2 and sergio leones spaghetti westerns slapstick action is present as ever but not overdone executed with crisp visual acumen and a welcome touch of experimentation decelerated frame rates give it an almost comicbooky feel  the films callow intelligence cant be understated puss in boots infamous for his bloated sense of selfconfidence finds himself neckdeep in the quicksand of an identity crisis we love the guy but he needed to be taken down a peg for him to become someone of true depth and character and so he becomes more than just a joke machine blossoming into full actualized personhood except hes a cat in boots and a hat with a little lappy tongue and who can still do the pooradorablekitty thing with his eyes thatll gooify you in seconds but now were emotionally involved with his psychological wellbeing something we surely never ever thought would happen with a character in a shrek spinoff who knew puss in boots could sink his claws in so deep
Jun 28 2023,positive,its darn good
Jun 2 2023,positive,                                                                               finally an animated movie sequel thats worth the wait one has come to expect little from computer animated franchise films these days  or any franchise films for that matter but puss in boots the last wish a follow up to the 2011 film puss in boots is both fun and thoughtful both puss in boots films have been directed by joel crawford with a stellar voice cast lead by antonio banderas as the swordwielding showman hero and fugitive cat a spinoff from the shrek franchise this is the story of a walking talking cat who sings songs celebrating his own greatness after hes vanquished a menacing giant a fallen bell sounds pusss death knell a lifetime of shenanigans and adventures later puss learns that he has ploughed through eight of his nine lives on doctors advice he hangs up his hat and boots and opts for a sedentary and safe life as a pet taking shelter with cat lady mama luna davine joy randolph he learns how to live as a domestic pet eating cat food and sharing a litter with tens of other felines so this is where dignity goes to die he mutters sardonically as he queues up for the communal litter trough thats until the cockney crime loving family of goldilocks florence pugh and the three bears olivia colman ray winstone samson kayo comes looking for puss in boots they need his help to steal a map to the magical star fearing death and an end to his legendary status an invigorated puss embarks on a quest to find the map the star and make his last wish a lonely but optimistic dog harvey guillén with aspirations of becoming a therapy dog becomes his unsolicited sidekick as they seek out the map they also encounter kitty softpaws salma hayek pusss competition and former love interest screenwriters paul fisher tommy swerdlow and tom wheeler build a fairy tale nursery rhyme multiverse into the story besides goldilocks and the three bears theres also big jack horner john mulaney a supersized avatar of little jack horner who stuck his thumb in a pie and pulled out a plum big jack horner is malevolent avaricious piemaker and collector of prized artefacts from excalibur to a flying carpet magic nanny bag and unicorn horns another dark force is the red eyed wolf wagner moura who haunts and follows puss on this rideordie adventure puss learns many lessons among them trust kinship and breaking down his own hubris the banter between puss and kitty banderas and hayekis especially fun as she ribs him he responds mock me quietly please through the little dog perrito they learn the value of stopping to smell the roses animal wisdom for the soul is peppered into an energetic and fastpaced narrative with colourful 3d rendering that creates an amusing family film voiced by a topnotch cast
Apr 14 2023,positive, puss in boots the last wish is the second installment of the puss in boots franchise and is definitely long overdue and one we didnt know we needed like the 90s cartoon theme songs this film did not need to go this hard but it did this time around instead of flying through the air and playing all the local kitties puss is grappling with debilitating anxiety and commitment issues all while dealing with the impermanence of life and literally facing his demons who knew puss in boots would have me leaving the theater wanting to sort my fing life out  the premise is simple puss reprised by the iconic antonio banderas is of course a household name in the thieving business his ego is on 1000 and hes wanted all over the land per yuushh this time his days are numbered while its true cats have nine lives puss has run out and is now on his last life knowing this he decides to retire to the grey havens where it is safe because he can no longer take the uncalculated risks he is known for but whispers on the wind say that the location of the elusive wishing star has surfaced the wishing star grants any wish to the person who finds it the star fell to earth eons ago and has yet to be found with pusss life on its last strand he feels this is his chance to get his lives and his confidence back  the story is solid with a band of characters all going through their own bouts of anxiety loss a lack of belonging and some serious control issues jack horner for one voiced by comedian extraordinaire john mulaney now jack horner is giving  sadistic repressed boy man the unhinged need to command more than just his destiny but all those around him is due to his childhood trauma obviously while he was the apple of his and his fans eyes as a child the pressure to keep putting thumbs in pies and the ridicule turned him into a callous monster while he is the keeper of the map to the wishing star he does not care who he has to off to make sure he takes ownership of that star throughout the story there are several people trying to control their situations by all means necessary except for newcomer perrito voiced by harvey guillén he is really just along for the ride more on him soon even kitty soft paws salma hayek who rejoins our protagonist puss to steal her own wish kitty is hired to find the wishing star but obviously plans to doublecross her employer you wonder why are puss and kitty not working together youd think shes the one who got him to slow down and park his litter box and she was we learn later in the film he could not commit contrary to his comment in the first puss in boots film while everyone has a right to this iron throne of the wishing star one of the people trying to change their storyline and take back control of their narrative is goldilocks voiced by the one and only florence pugh goldi is running around with her adopted family  the three bears we got mama bear oscar winning actor olivia coleman papa bear ray winstone and baby bear samson kayo they are a band of grifters a con family if you will goldi is promising this wishing star is their last big job to change their lives yet she has other ideas to get back to her real family she knows her true family is out there and she deserves to be loved by her real parents and live a normal fairytale life when i tell you i almost cried when goldi revealed her truth and mama bear with tears in her eyes says if this will make you happy lets go get your wish done this woman said flat out you raised me but youre not my family  and a true mama said your happiness is what a mama is for my unfertilized eggs gasped coming to the realization of your reality and taking stock of what you have has always been a tough spot for me not that i am shaming my family and looking for some other family but the idea of always looking towards the future being in complete disbelief that i have everything now that i need to succeed and have the life i want whats the saying its hard to see the forest through the trees now this was only the tip of the emotional iceberg in this film  what takes the last wish over the top is the introduction of pusss true villain puss doesnt just retire when he recounts all his deaths a character arrives ready to take puss to his final grave wolf the classic big bad arrives redeyed and ready wielding chained sickles with skills well beyond pusss abilities plus he has an entrance whistle that could freeze the blood in anyones veins this chills puss to his core this mans is terrifying i found myself with goosebumps on my forearms every time he arrived and i kept asking myself why this is just a cartoon fictional character im watching antonio banderas as a cat in boots for bast sake why is this character so menacing and inescapable why is this so close to home when you realize through the metaphor of is all he is the reaper  death himself the final chapter the one you cannot beat  i started to feel my heart rate rise and my breath quicken i too have been struggling with the anxiety that comes with the thought of my final day on this earth death its considered one of the five core fears in human existence its the fear of annihilation of ceasing to exist   best self we cannot evade death and for me it isnt necessarily not knowing what is on the other side its facing that big bad wolf its the whistle on the wind and knowing its coming no matter what whether we go to heaven or see our loved ones once again is the selfsoothing part for some but the anxiety of the end begins with the imagination of my final moments then i lose my breath and hot tears begin to well up and fall its a wild thought that i saw this right in front of my eyes in the sweet animated face of puss  in my life i have been searching for ways to handle the anxiety of it all as the virgo i am i analyze and rationalize my thoughts until it no longer scares me or at least until it makes more sense and i reach acceptance puss ran from it as if a crafty escape would provide the freedom of relief but in inexplicable ways that whistle would creep in and hood shadowed red eyes would show up for me it came in the form of the third rail projects production of grand paradise in an immersive live theater experience i was guided around a number of storylines based on the promise of eternal life in one moment i was thrust into my own wake yes i was asked to lay down given flowers as four box walls were formed around me and visitors invited to look upon my body at that moment i was given a chance to analyze my final chapter a glimpse into my funeral did not hurl me into a massive panic attack it was calm it was surreal a true out of body experience and one that didnt have the answers sway   but let me peer through the veil into a universe unknown i know that sounds epic compared to the puss in boots storyline but it was one and the same puss was given the opportunity to truly understand and know the value of life itself and the value of the only life he has left  so puss is walking through this labyrinth all the while pushing down and ignoring his anxieties when those red eyes appear in the fray puss is hurdled into the clutches of death at the final stretch when were so close to the star puss blacks out he is running just booking it hes trying to get away from something he knows he cannot escape hes hiding hes hyperventilating and the hairs on his body are standing at attention hes gonna lose consciousness perrito comes running and even he looks frazzled he doesnt know what to do he just closes his eyes and lays his head on pusss chest puss pets him as his heart rate lowers his breath regulates and he comes back to reality this almost made me cry like toy story 3 levels cry it asked the question  what do we do when we are faced with our largest fears and selfsoothing is not enough the wolf came to claim puss because his only treasure was the fact that he felt invincible that he could just figure it all out on his own and had all the time in the world this is the crux of his issues he could not accept death and truly appreciate his life we only have this one life and we cannot spend it running from death or trying to beat it we have to see the forest enjoy the leaves and see how the sun shines through the canopy one day yes this will fade and all we have are the memories people are what make life worth being alive no matter how many lives you have ahh its corny af but i care not puss in boots is a teachable moment for all of us because even though all of the resources in the world are at our fingertips we still find a way to ignore our needs and think we can do it all by ourselves now is puss in boots the reason i am able to get through panic attacks no therapy and meditation is gonna have to come through too but puss in boots telling this stories  right now brought a new level of acknowledgment to this sht were all going through and honestly im thankful for that  what a time we live in where our cartoon characters can give us the space to explore mental health and the importance of leaning on our community all done with a double sickle wielding judge doom piercing

Mar 5 2023,positive, home  recommendation  films to watch  the bonus features included with puss in boots the last wish expound upon everything you mightve noticed or secrets you missed entirely between puss in boots films there was an 11year gap 11 years where original voice actor antonio banderas desperado official competition played several supporting roles in other shrekrelated projects big and small but not where the fearsome fighting feline took the lead rather than opt for a flimsy tale that would entertain audiences but would be ultimately forgettable director joel crawford the croods a new age and codirector januel mercado with a script from paul fisher the croods a new age and tommy swerdlow the grinch made something that would push the boundaries of childrens entertainment making that pgrating bulge with each meticulously elaborate scene riding the line between the silliness of the shrek universe from which it came and something far more grimm puss in boots the last wish explores the value of appreciating where you are and what you have as taking things for granted is an empty lonely road with the dreamworks animation adventure now out on home video you can explore all this and more with the litany of included bonus materials though this is an initial review for puss in boots the last wish in order to discuss the home release properly we need to dig in just a little deeper requiring spoiling specific aspects of the film now that youve been warned read on if you dare assassin mercenary lover hero swashbuckling tabby puss in boots

reserved of all the characters that have teamed up with shrek over the years ive never quite gelled with puss especially since ive been a fan of banderas since desperado 1995 and i enjoy his comedic selfdeprecating side quite a bit ive always found it odd that it took me until late 2022 to finally watch 2011s original solo puss outing in order to prepare myself for the last wish amusing an adventure as that was its still not something id likely revisit unless one of my kids asks to so when it came time to watch the last wish to describe my interest as nearzero is the closest to capturing the mood what i was not prepared for was the mature narrative a deep and dark look at the repercussions of vainglorious lifestyle as hes literally hunted by death in form of the wolf i couldnt for the life of me figure out who this film was for  the adults who likely first met puss in 2004s shrek 2 or their children whom might find the whole story a little too much the mixture of expectation and reaction made for something volatile in my mind making the film a harder watch as it went along yet the online response has been incredible with critics and general audiences hailing the films beauty its truthfulness and its daring my favorite animated films of 2022 include pompo the cinephile marcel the shell with shoes on the bobs burgers movie unicorn wars and turning red among others so the medium of animation isnt the issue nor is the exploration of heady topics with this in mind and the opportunity for a home release review having come up i decided to revisit the film with tempered expectations and a grip on the narrative i cant say that i would queue this up for fun in the same way that ive replayed pompo bobs or turning red frequently but in the same way that one might find themselves in the mood for an adult thoughtful investigation of complex ideas and therefore put on unicorn wars so would i put this on although the inclusion of harvey guilléns sweet perrito does endear the film just a tad more than even i am willing to admit so with that in mind i revisited the film with the featurelength commentary from crawford mercado producer mark swift editor james ryan and head of story heidi jo gilbert turned on listening to them discuss the process of breaking shaping and editing the story is eyeopening the intention hinted at with the words this is a fairytale pasted at the start is for the last wish to be a part of the shrek universe while also being something all of its own they also discuss the intentionality of the darkness of the narrative and the application of the visual framework to convey that using the painting motif to give it a different language from the shrek films while also making it look like the drawings in a grimm fairytales storybook with the exploration of intentionality they point out the many times death is a major component of the story either by placing a skull near puss such as in his opening musical number where its behind his head or creating the illusion of one with blocking and set design by hiding the wolf out in the open for fast eyes to see or intentionally using perrito hes such a good boy and a dogs often soft sweet demeanor as the perfect foil to puss and kitty softpawss salma hayek pinault catlike independence and selfishness my favorite thing about home releases is the opportunity to learn about the filmmaking process and the inclusion of feature commentary often feels like a rarity as more home releases include a trailer perhaps a single brief behind the scenes featurette and thats it here however theres so much to learn that where someone such as me found the initial watch discordant in seeing how the pieces fit in learning of the intent i can finally view the bigger picture and at the very least appreciate what is accomplished even if i can recognize that the film as a whole may not be for me lr wolf wagner moura and puss in boots antonio banderas in dreamworks animations puss in boots the last wish directed by joel crawford  2022 dreamworks animation all rights reserved perhaps my favorite detail to learn relates to the sequence between the giant and puss during the opening as the music blares and the giant attacks pusss movements and the giants are deliberately staged on beat with the music i likely wouldnt have noticed this on my own and its mentioned that this is a concept lifted directly from edgar wrights baby driver 2017 a film whose entire blocking and choreography is built around the music and score details like this are what make commentary tracks so valuable as they may be the only way that some film fans and cinephiles are able to get to learn about productions the other bonus features offer their own rewards looks at the cast at work or offering their thoughts on making the film three deleted scenes with introductions an allcat cam for feline enthusiasts as well as several artistic projects that may entertain younger fans but the commentary is where youll want to spend your time after an initial watch theres so much that they share and this may be the only way to know it for this review universal pictures home entertainment provided a 4k uhd edition that included both a bluray and a digital copy be advised that an issue ive had with other digital editions is present here when viewing bonus features through itunes all audio and no video this occurred with several of the a cast of characters featurettes the new short the trident jack horners lineorama and a few others when i tried to access them via the 4k uhd disc there was no issue another lovely thing about the home release the bonus features arent limited to one disc format often with combo packs the bonus features may be on the bluray only or somehow lock materials to digital or physicalonly that doesnt appear to be the case here as you can access any and all no matter the format you prefer of course i cant speak to the dvd edition as that wasnt included so keep that in mind as expected though the 4k uhd looks great with this release i may not fully grasp the intention of using the style beyond lets make it look different because were telling a pseudooutside the shrek universe story but i cant argue with the athome representation especially in the initial scene with the wolf and the clown car of characters at the fallen star the 4k uhd with hdr provides the kind of depth of field and appropriate shading of colors that make one feel that theyre watching something unique lr puss in boots antonio banderas perrito harvey guillén and kitty softpaws salma hayek pinault in dreamworks animations puss in boots the last wish directed by joel crawford  2022 dreamworks animation all rights reserved im of the mind that not all films need to be for me to appreciate them i like the overall concepts of the last wish more than i do the execution but that seems to hinge more on how i feel about puss specifically if you were one of many who made repeat trips to the theater who has discussed and analyzed everything from the initial musical number to the perfectly executed panic attack scene who has sought after a stuffed perrito toy because we know universal has them then snagging the last wish is an absolute forgone conclusion for those like me who may need something more than being a completist and making sure you have all the shrek movies under one roof the bonus features are where its at
Mar 5 2023,positive, the boxtrolls 2014  kubo and the two strings 2016 with coraline and paranorman both hitting 4k this past december laikas other stopmotion wonders are now joining them in the format adapted from alan snows novel here be monsters the boxtrolls starts off employing a familiar and oftused formula  ie the story of a young boy in the midst of various critters everything from the jungle book to where the wild things are  before eventually hitting its own unique stride the title creatures are harmless trolls who are nevertheless feared by the citizens of the town of cheesebridge wanting to be accepted by the ruling elite the scurvy archibald snatcher voiced by ben kingsley promises to exterminate the meek monsters a task that meets resistance in eggs isaac hempstead wright a boy who was raised by the boxtrolls elle fanning sister of coraline star dakota fanning voices a girl who aids eggs in his task while nick frost richard ayoade and tracy morgan pipe up as snatchers underlings the final bit that seeps into the end credits  a philosophical discussion between frosts mr trout and ayoades mr pickles  is a marvelously meta moment like coraline paranorman and the boxtrolls before it kubo and the two strings also nabbed an academy award nomination for best animated feature and then did them all one better by also becoming only the second animated film after the nightmare before christmas to compete in the best visual effects category certainly its a visually striking picture drawing much of its style from various japanese modes of artistic expression both ancient origami and modern miyazaki kubo voiced by art parkinson is a young boy who embarks on a journey to find the armor of the father he never knew accompanying him on his odyssey are an anthropomorphic monkey charlize theron a beetle warrior matthew mcconaughey with amnesia and an origami samurai standing in their way are insidious entities known as the moon king ralph fiennes and the sisters rooney mara this is the only laika production where the length is felt but even an occasional lull doesnt dent the pictures startling design and mystical aura each twodisc steelbook set sold separately offers the film on a 4k uhd disc and the special features on a bluray extras are similar in nature as each includes audio commentary by codirectors graham annable and anthony stacchi on the boxtrolls and directorproducer travis knight on kubo and the two strings rare test footage a piece on the puppets featurelength storyboards and photo galleries devotion 2022 jonathan majors has already been making a name for himself both on television lovecraft country loki and in film the last black man in san francisco da 5 bloods but 2023 seems to be the year that hes truly breaking out thanks to his acclaimed performances as the antagonists in antman and the wasp quantumania and creed iii slipping between the cracks of all these highprofile projects was devotion a 90 million naval aviation flick that crashed and burned with a 20 million gross in the year of the thrillaminute top gun maverick its easy to see how something so languorous would keep the masses away but the truth is that this plodding and underdeveloped picture would register as a noble failure at any time centering on reallife figures who served as officers during the korean war this stars majors as jesse brown the first black aviator in navy history and glen powell as tom hudner his best friend and wingman for a film meant to inspire and invigorate devotion is an awfully timid endeavor and the script based on adam makos book devotion an epic story of heroism friendship and sacrifice is respectful to a fault taking a muted masterpiece theatre approach to a fullblooded tale whose messier elements included the racism that brown had to confront on a regular basis powell so dynamic in top gun maverick is largely ineffectual here and we never feel the supposed depths of the friendship that existed between his hudner and majors brown marathon man 1976 a powerhouse cast brings steely conviction to this atmospheric thriller efficiently directed by midnight cowboy helmer john schlesinger and penned by william goldman adapting his own novel dustin hoffman is excellent if a tad too old as babe levy a graduate student and hardcore runner who doesnt know that his older brother doc a superb roy scheider is a government agent and one whos presently involved in dealings with nazi war criminal christian szell laurence olivier convinced that babe knows the whereabouts of a stash of diamonds he himself had taken from executed jews during wwii szell uses his knowledge of dentistry to torture the clueless babe leading to the films classic line is it safe and force the college student to employ his marathon training to extract himself from a harrowing situation tricky in its plot structure the movie cannily plops a complete innocent in the midst of people who are smarter stronger and savvier and then requires him to outlast them all in order to survive only the climactic doubleheader a confrontation in a desolate house and a scuffle in a central park maintenance facility disappoints for his chilling performance as a nazi olivier earned a best supporting actor oscar nomination two years later he would nab a best actor oscar nomination for his hammy performance as a nazi hunter in the boys from brazil goldman meanwhile deservedly won the best adapted screenplay oscar for his other 1976 credit all the presidents men puss in boots the last wish 2022 even though antonio banderas puss in boots owned the shrek franchise from the moment he was introduced in the second film that was no reason to hand him his own film or at least that was my thinking upon the 2011 release of puss in boots a toon flick i found listless and lackluster but puss in boots the last wish turning up 11 years after its predecessor is a laudable vehicle for the energetic and egocentric feline frequently forsaking the snarky and occasionally tiresome brand of humor that defined the shrek crop and carried over into the first pib this one does a fine job of balancing its knockabout humor with a surprisingly somber tale of how the specter of death can limit ones ability to fully embrace and enjoy life having used up eight of his nine lives puss perpetually tries to stay a step ahead of death personified as a sicklewielding wolf and  voiced by wagner moura and hes joined by former partner kitty softpaws returning salma hayek pinault and a scruffy dog harvey guillén as he attempts to find the wishing star and regain all of his lives yet hes not the only one seeking the star with his nemeses including goldilocks florence pugh and jack horner john mulaney an oscar nominee for best animated feature film this may not be as original or innovative as fellow contenders and frontrunners marcel the shell with shoes on and guillermo del toros pinocchio but darn if it didnt move me the most training day 2001 despite formidable performances in the likes of malcolm x and fences denzel washingtons only best actor oscar to date he earlier had won a supporting statue for 1989s glory was for this gritty and initially engrossing cop flick washington is riveting as alonzo harris an la narcotics officer who gives rookie jake hoyt ethan hawke nabbing a best supporting actor nomination one day to see if he has what it takes to work under his command jake is thrilled with the opportunity but he soon realizes that alonzos methods which usually involve bending or breaking the law fly in the face of his own idealism the role of alonzo harris would allow any actor ample opportunities to chew the scenery but washington repeatedly refuses the bait  his performance is all livewire mobility and coiled intensity theres also a delicious ambiguity in david ayers screenplay that suggests alonzos dirty deeds might be the only way for a cop to survive on the streets unfortunately all philosophical musings about the moral dilemma in committing evil for the sake of goodness are washed away in the third act as the movie sheds all lofty ambitions and becomes a police shootemup marked by contrived circumstances and convenient coincidences extras in the 4k  bluray  digital code edition include audio commentary by director antoine

destruction in new york hong kong and elsewhere meteor isnt as cheesy as some of the other entries in the disaster cycle but its also not much fun with reams of dry dialogue visual effects that run hot and cold and slumming movie stars trying their damnedest to stay awake still you do get to hear connery ask government bigwigs forcing him to help out why dont you also stick a broom up my ass so i can sweep the floor on the way out the cast also includes martin landau in the hammy portion of his otherwise stellar career see also 1980s without warning and 1982s alone in the dark as a

Feb 22 2023,neutral, dreamworks animation succeeded in building its brand through the initial popularity of the shrek franchise while the entirety of the shrek cinematic universe has earned the accolades of its first two entries its most famous feline characters spinoff series has landed chiefly on its feet puss in boots the last wish with antonio banderass signature rasp behind the swashbuckling orange tabby has amplified the reimagining of fairy tales through a grittier visually stunning and grounded narrative  the sequel to puss in boots is brimming with vibrancy and life its rich creativity has been scarce in 2022s animation slate and even if the storys resolution may feel fairly predictable the charming nature of the central journey and the simpleyeteffective message hammers morality into the films purpose while its not surprising that puss in boots the last wish treads into more adult conflicts it was unexpected that one of the best metaphors for death in animation would be found in wagner mournas chilling wolf puss in boots the last wish echoes the sentiment that we are to make the most of the one life were given but not to take it too seriously  puss in boots the last wish takes necessary risks without losing subscribing to the assumption that all sequels lose their luster 8510 
Feb 20 2023,positive, for her directorial debut michelle garza cervera decided she wasnt going to play it safe instead she presents a chilling dissection of the tribulations of pregnancy following a woman settling into a domestic life having grown up fighting against that very idea having prayed to a statue of the virgin of guadalupe valeria solián and her husband raúl dosal receive the outcome they desire as their lives are about to be blessed with a newborn baby however the following months for valeria are plagued by sneering family members a loss of profession a husband who fears sex in case it harms their baby a desire for her old partner and oh a malevolent entity that wishes to possess her in short shes had better times huesera portrays a slowburning subtle horror that has an alarming intimacy its far more focused on valerias struggles against a culture that expects her as a woman to submit to motherhood than with traditional horror  but theres enough of that throughout also she spends her pregnancy trying to live up to what others want when its apparent she isnt clear on what she wants and these moments provide plenty of discomfort alongside scenes of a menacing presence that lurks in the shadows and torments valeria at every given opportunity this entity is based on actual mexican folklore cervera shows plenty of flair in her direction and the combined cinematography and sound design are especially impressive  at times the sound literally crackles throughout as sequences of silence are shattered by the sickening crunch of bones as valeria spirals further physically and mentally the movie veers more into conventional horror as the third act begins leading to a visually striking and satisfying conclusion but crucially the movie isnt upended or disjointed tonally by this shift with a super lead performance from natalie solián in her feature debut sharp writing and a combination of sequences that get under your skin huesera is a triumphant debut offering the pace and overall lack of scares may not be to everyones tastes and at times it does feel sluggish but huesera delivers a powerful engaging and sometimes bruising experience the australian film scene is one that consistently delivers strong productions that often fall below the radar and their horror scene has in the past delivered some excellent entries into the genre with surrogate debutant director david willing opts to foray into the supernatural with a story focusing on natalie morassi  a single mother and nurse who after aiding a sick woman late at night falls mysteriously ill this illness results in immediate symptoms of pregnancy that quickly culminates in an apparent birth though the baby is nowhere to be found with the ire of doctors and child services raised and her physical and mental wellbeing on a rapid downward spiral natalie must do everything within in her power to keep her family and herself from falling apart whilst not wholly original  the film does lean heavily on its influences  surrogate is an effective and sometimes excellent lowbudget horror movie that blends supernatural elements with mystery and thriller aspects anchored by a strong lead performance from kestie morassi theres a confidence that flows through surrogate which is a testament to willing and cowriter beth king and its competent production blends well with mark buys score at times the movie can feel solid if unspectacular but sprinkled throughout are some genuinely excellent sequences  a seance midway through the movie is perfectly framed and executed to deliver a deliciously atmospheric and tense situation  and the conclusion was unexpectedly bleak and striking its an ending that really props the movie up satisfyingly with the varying subplots characters and genre crossovers the movie does sometimes threaten to derail itself and whilst not every aspect is a success at no point do the wheels fall off entirely surrogate is an assured debut feature that attempts to blend the old and new and more often than not succeeds in doing so the time of kang is now antman and the wasp quantumania is both the 31st movie in the everlingering marvel cinematic universe and the feature debut of jonathan majors kang the conqueror  described as the next thanoslevel villain for our avengers heroes peyton reed returns to helm the third eusocialthemed blockbuster as paul rudds scott lang along with his daughter cassie newton the wasp lilly hank pym douglas and janet van dyne pfeiffer explore the mysterious quantum realm and in doing so threaten to unleash a force that could take over the universe how they get there is a bit ridiculous as is the rest of the movie sadly quantumania is a disjointed messy and frankly bland movie that basically serves as a setup for the next batch of mcu movies at the expense ofbeing an antman movie quantumania starts off feeling like an antman flick and its as breezy and fun as youd expect but once the quantum realm is introduced everything begins to fall apart narratively the need to move things along to introduce kang and his backstory at the expense of the story is plainly obvious alongside some tedious foreshadowing of him he and someone  michelle pfeiffer is asked to lazily spend half the movie not telling her family information which would be deemed as crucial to their plight thankfully jonathan majors saves the movie with his strong and menacing performance as kang each scene he is in is elevated to the point that the rest of the movie seems vanilla by comparison thats not to say paul rudd isnt his usual charming self he is and hes doing what he does best here but the rest of the castarent great  i assumed throughout that michael douglas had quit acting whilst filming this the cast has to work with what they are given so that should be taken into consideration but their characters end up becoming lost in the sheer glob of colour and sometimes toecurling vfx im fully aware that the quantum realm needs to be realised somehow but even for a multiverse setting it felt too much here especially with the stagecraft usage that stuck out badly the art department was afforded licence to have fun with their designs though with an abundance of aliens and funky background characters even if it did feel a bit star warsy at times and this element allowed for some ace character designs to distract from the visuals shallow script and uninspired gags  though modok was well awful as someone who dug the first two antman movies this feels like a step back for the character in service of the now standardmcu setups which is a shame we get kang which is great but its hard not to wish that he could have been introduced in a better movie after an encouraging start quantumania succumbs to mediocrity when it had the chance to propel the mcu forward effectively jonathan majors is great but the movie is anything but oh and bill murray appears for some reason everyones favourite swashbuckling feline is back in puss in boots the last wishbut for how long you see puss banderas has long neglected the value of his nine lives and is now down to his final one after a brush with a villainous wolf moura causes him to retire to a cat home puss is quickly drawn back into the fight when the chance to wish his lives back into existence rears its head  but hes not the only one trying to reach the mythical last wish 2011s puss in boots was well received as a spinoff to the shrek franchise but a sequel after twelve years seemed like an odd choice specifically where has the interest come from to suddenly release a sequel now well im glad that dreamworks decided to push forward as puss in boots the last wish is wonderful a movie about a marauding cat delivering some genuinely poignant themes of friendship selflessness mental health and mortality was not on my bingo card this year but here it is the movie offers some deliciously realised animated action set pieces good comedy unsurprisingly strong voice acting from banderas and hayek plus a slew of newcomers including florence pugh and harvey guilléns cutesy perrito and one of the better villains i have seen in years  wagner mouras wolf had such a sinister presence that never let up his menacing smile and whistle was a real sign that it was about to hit the fan similarly the movie follows suit in that it doesnt condescend to the audience in delivering its narrative and messages which is something that cannot be levied at other animated movies in recent years also at one point a dude has his skin sucked right from his skeleton crucially whilst the story does sag somewhat at the midway point theres more than enough on offer throughout to keep audiences of all ages engaged and engrossed in the adventure emotional and surprisingly excellent puss in boots the last wish is one of dreamworks best and a real crowdpleaser when you see the surname cronenberg attached to anything you should know that youre in for a wild ride the poster alone for brandon cronenbergs latest effort infinity pool is odd enough alexander skarsgård submerged in a red goo as mia goth looks on seductivelymenacingly beside him  that would explain the pool of it all the story centres on struggling author james foster skarsgård and his wife em coleman who whilst vacationing at a luxury resort on the reclusive island of li tolqa meet gabi goth and alban lespert whilst all initially seems pleasant an incident outside of the resort all guests are explicitly told not to leave the resort involving both couples sends the fosters relationship into turmoil and james spiralling into an abyss of excess depravity and lust having witnessedsomethingthat initially repulsed him before becoming fully seduced by the idea if you couldnt tell i am attempting to keep things as vague as possible so as not to drop spoilers for what is a fever dream packed with sex orgies urine dark humour and violence  its a lot however infinity pool feels focused narratively and in its direction  this feels like a step up from cronenberg jrs previous movie possessor  with its themes of depersonalization hedonism and the rich indulging their unkempt desires money is the root of all evil and all that skarsgård delivers a fine performance as he walks the lines between fear anxiety rage lust and acceptance and goth provides yet another example of her exceptional talents she again plays a scarilygenuine feeling psychopath their interplay between them is fascinating to watch the movie as a whole may not be fascinating for everyone to watch as it depicts graphic sexual scenes drug usage full frontal nudity and blunt violence  its not the heaviest movie ive ever seen but it may prove to be too challenging for some infinity pool comes out of the gate fast with a strong first half before settling into a satisfyingly solid second half though i never felt any real lulls throughout the intrigue is enticing and there is enough black comedy to ensure proceedings dont become too wild  theres a real maturity to the storytelling here and provides another interesting addition to brandons burgeoning filmography cocaine bear the two words that have come to define cinema this is cinema this is cocaine bear right enough silliness ill leave that for the movie itself having taken the internet by storm simply due to its title and premise  that being a bear feasted on a large amount of ditched cocaine in 1985  could elizabeth banks latest directorial effort live up to the hype kind of if youre going into the movie expecting to see a coked up bear going on a rampage then youll find yourself in luck butbearin mind that a hefty chunk of the ninetyfive minute runtime is gifted to a host of human characters most of whom arent particularly interesting now this being called a true story comes with the notion that you take that with a pinch of salt a major amount of liberties have been taken here but without those liberties this would be a very boring movie did the real cocaine bear massacre a rabble of misfits no but why let the truth get in the way of a drugfuelled story at no point does the movie lose sight of what it is though this is selfaware comedy horror and everyone here is game for the mission  o shea jackson jr and alden ehrenreich are both having a blast as is margo martindale and keri russell is dependably solid in her role as sari mother of young teen dee dee prince who is taken by the bear when she and her friend henry convery ditch school for a days adventure in the national park the issue is that the characters themselves dont really have a lot to them other than their gimmick and as the movie doesnt lean in hard enough to each of them they feel undercooked and underserved similarly whilst the bear brings nothing but terror the nagging sense that this could have gone harder or wilder never left me its bloody for sure and there are some great gags but i left my viewing feeling like the movie would have been morefun had banks trimmed some of the unnecessary subplots  including a sweet but unnecessary one about a dog  then the movie would have felt that bit tighter and allowed for more focus on the bear and the humans fighting for survival for what it is essentially a jacked up bmovie cocaine bear is still a fun enough ride however for a movie called cocaine bear to be left with the feeling that this was not crazy enough is wellcrazy

Feb 9 2023,positive, puss in boots faces an existential crisis in this riotously fun oscarnominated sequel from dreamworks having recklessly used up eight of his nine lives the fearless feline is forced to accept that his roistering days are over  unless he can restore his vitality by wishing on a star however hes not alone in his search for the mythical land where it can be found and so begins a race for the prize as voiced by antonio banderas puss oozes charm from every paw with his newfound vulnerability making his character all the more endearing among the rest of the fairytale supporting cast goldilocks and the three bears get a coarse corblimey makeover courtesy of florence pugh olivia colman samson kayo and naturally ray winstone while john mulaney bags all the best lines as a truly monstrous jack horner the animation particularly comes alive during the animestyled action scenes while the sharp script delivers gags galore and pleasing nods to the wizard of oz the good the bad and the ugly and the wider shrekverse coming 11 years after the original puss in boots film the last wish proves a sensational swashbuckling return for everyones favourite costumed cat
Feb 9 2023,positive,it lived up to all of the hype the story was so strong 
Feb 8 2023,positive, expectations can derail a movie there are times when you can enter a theater without them but its harder than you think a sequel doubles down on this theory a sequel to a beloved movie is essentially going all in from the jump knives out was a spectacular hit because of a whodunit concept crafted to perfection and a very good cast led by daniel craig jamie lee curtis don johnson ana de armas christopher plummer toni collette michael shannon and chris evans played fine parts in the mystery stacked cast a dry wit sense of humor and rian johnson unplugging after pissing in the cheerios of star wars fans it was a beautiful perfectly paced dark comedy thriller plummers rich novelist dies leaving behind a mystery for his greedy family to unfold and solveone designed by the departed soul glass onion a knives out mystery takes that setup and spins it a bit its edward nortons uber rich elon musktype dipshit who invites all of his oldest friends to solve his murder mystery craigs famous benoit blanc also attends bringing along his amazing slowburn detective instincts to the fray of greed katie hudson dave bautista janelle monae and kathryn hahn sub in here for the intrigued party members who get to play a real life game of clue the concept of that game is sewn into johnsons films and that gets you through the first half of the movie but this sequel lacks the overall spark of the original losing some speed on the fastball is standard practice for this arena but i left the film satisfied with what was received however i wasnt jumping out of his pants wanting to talk about it hence the three week wait until this review what gets set up and revealed midway is ingenious what follows afterwards is the softball part of the equation craig and monae have the most fun and give easily the best performances when theyre together on screen its as if they are aloof to the rest of the movie and cast norton cant give a bad performance but he recycles his asshat from the italian job here and its not as appealing the rest of the cast goes through the motions of film personas they created before this movie at times i was very entertained other times i wanted more out of what i was watching expectations can do that to a film for better or worse ill give glass onion a 24 rating the world wasnt exactly screaming for a sequel to puss in boots granted the furry little fella stole a good chunk of the shrek film and the solo film made 555 million while scoring an 86 on rotten tomatoes eleven years after the 2011 film puss in boots the last wish attempts the impossible hitting the net on your third trip through the order overall the last wish is a success coming in at a brisk 100 minutes and carrying enough pop culture humor to fill two movies this sequel gives you the goods its a ticket to the antonio banderas show he puts in wonderful voice work infusing the animated swordsavvy feline with charisma and passion its not one of those phone it in voice performances you can really tell banderas loves this character the story revolves around puss running out of eight of his nine lives finding himself on the run feuding off attackers along the way he teams up with kitty softpaws the lovely selma hayek to help stretch out the clock a supporting cast of florence pugh pughpugh olivia colman harvey guillen and john mulaney doesnt hurt at all i would slot this in as a movie that keeps the adults attention while giving the kids a good eye candy session its impossible not to root for puss to run the gauntlet and get the girl even if watching him sweat and adjust facial hair on the fly is a fun time lets go 34 for pussssss in boots 2 if i had to choose between the two i would punch your pass to puss and leave the onion in the kitchen im more of a donut hole guy anyway since its christmas eve i want to say one more thing first hey meme no its not pronounced how you think before words on a picture went viral young lebanese boys called their grandmothers meme or maymay she was a tiny ball of fire henrietta bulus mastered at least five languages spoke with mother teresa threw more dinner parties than anyone on blue jay

Feb 7 2023,positive,the last wish offers something different and unexpected puss has grown up with his audience
Feb 6 2023,positive, the shrek universe expands a little more with puss in boots the last wish another computeranimated family film from dreamworks with antonio banderas and salma hayek pinnault reprising their roles as puss and his frenemy kitty softclaws directors joel crawford and januel mercado serve up a treat one worthy of its oscar nod for best animated feature as with all the shrek cinematic universe output puss in boots the last wish subverts fairytales and nursery rhymes while telling its story and part of the fun is seeing which the writers paul fisher tommy swerdlow and tom wheeler plunder and then reimagine for modern audiences some references are simply to make a gag the movie is stuffed full of them while others make a nod to serious points such as the importance of loyalty or how ageing and death are realities of life the story centres on puss who with horror realises that he is on the last of his nine lives and using a map filled with riddles has to find a wishing star to restore them but before he can reach it he is stalked by death here given the form of a big bad wolf wagner moura also involved in pusss adventure are goldi florence pugh and the three bears olivia colman ray winstone and samson kayo  reimagined as a cockney crime family  and big jack horner john mulaney as an immensely greedy hoarder of all things magical which might help the assorted cast get to the wishing star before puss does its a clever conceit the film starts with a lengthy sequence in which our hero performs yet more acts of derring do in defeating a giant and is everyones hero then because hes a player he parties till dawn  keep that fullcream milk coming  but realises time is catching up with him his journey begins to find the wishing star but of course he faces any number of obstacles  with the wolf stalking his every move along the way puss teams up with former paramour kitty softpaws cue some outrageous feline flirting and perrito harvey guillén an adorable runt of the litter who attaches himself to the two cats whether they want him to or not his naivety is touching  he thinks being thrown in a rubbish bin was his familys version of hide and seek  but perrito turns out to be strong and brave when puss needs him most one of the many life lessons subtly parlayed in this film the animation style is warm and uses high colour the films visual richness giving the impression almost that were stepping into a picture book its very appealing
Feb 6 2023,positive, this shrek spinoff is a breezily entertaining dreamworks animation that harnesses the familiar appeal of the selfaggrandising feline antonio banderas while also adopting a distinctive and original graphic visual style directors joel crawford and januel mercado both worked on the kung fu panda films and its perhaps this plus the striking stylised action sequences of spiderman into the spiderverse that informs the bold peppy approach to pusss gravitydefying derringdo the plot is basic down to his final life puss sees an opportunity to restore the full nine with a magic wishing star hes not the only one seeking it goldilocks and her ursine crime syndicate are on his trail as is the monstrous big jack horner and then theres kitty softpaws salma hayek and wannabe emotional support animal perrito the chihuahua harvey guillén it helps that the writing is as sharp as pusss claws
Feb 3 2023,positive, theres nothing funny about morbid obesity yet its depiction on screen is usually in the service of comedy  terry jones as mr creosote in monty pythons the meaning of life 1983 lumbers unavoidably to mind hugely fat characters also populate horror and fantasy films but its not often that you find one as the protagonist in a love story admittedly darren aronofskys the whale isnt a conventional love story  it isnt a conventional anything  but its about love nonetheless both destructive and redemptive charlie brendan fraser weighs over 40 st and is not just housebound but practically chairbound he is a middleaged academic who teaches creative writing online from his apartment somewhere in idaho but is so crippled by his colossal size that he cannot get to the front door without a walkingframe he picks things up from the floor with a grabber contraption like the ones children aim at furry pink rabbits in amusement arcades and is sufficiently selfconscious about his appearance that when he teaches he pretends that the camera on his laptop is broken he can be heard over zoom but not seen we enter charlies life with it appears very little of it to go his fierce but devoted carer liz hong chau tells him that congestive heart failure will soon see him off that he needs urgent hospital treatment to have any chance of survival but charlie doesnt want to pay expensive medical bills not least because he has no wish to survive when he does think his death is imminent he rather oddly begs a visiting missionary ty simpkins to read him extracts from an essay about moby dick the reason for this will emerge but in the meantime charlie is eating himself into an early grave with a daily intake of pizzas and sandwiches that would feed a hungry family of six he wasnt always so fat but the suicide of his male lover  for whom he had left his wife mary samantha morton and daughter ellie sadie sink  triggered a spectacular bingeeating habit that he is neither able nor willing to control charlies psychological demons become clearer when 17yearold ellie comes to see him for the first time in eight years she is charmless at best at worst vicious and manipulative but charlie even though he has to bribe her to continue calling on him sees only the good in her indeed it is perhaps the chief irony in darren aronofskys bold drama that charlie has a generous almost childlike view of humanity in general that he cannot apply to himself i was no fan of aronofskys last film the ghastly voyeuristic mother 2017 but he is certainly anything but anodyne as a director and the whale  adapted by samuel d hunter from his own 2012 play  deserves all the attention it will continue to have up to academy awards night next month in many respects it is another exercise in audience voyeurism you have been warned and from where i was sitting its intrinsic theatricality diminishes its value as a film apart from a couple of fleeting flashbacks we dont move beyond the confines of his home any more than sweet selfloathing charlie does but with a nod for whoever looked after the fat suit and prosthetics frasers performance is genuinely stupendous he is the favourite to win best actor at the oscars and i can understand why its less easy to understand why m night shyamalan thought knock at the cabin  an adaptation of paul tremblays 2018 novel the cabin at the end of the world a much better title  would be worth either his while or ours  its slickly enough written and acted but its a truly preposterous story about a gay couple and their adopted daughter whose holiday home deep in the pennyslvania woods is invaded by a modern and curiously polite incarnation of the four horsemen of the apocalypse this strange quartet led by a kindly teacher dave bautista and also featuring rupert grint as a grumpy gasfitter with much to be grumpy about must convince the family that they need to start sacrificing one another if they are to save the planet from impending doom its not really made clear why theyve been chosen from 78 billion or so other people in the world and im afraid the film is another dud from shyamalan who has never come close to matching his 1999 masterpiece the sixth sense in this movie he has given himself a hitchcockstyle cameo role selling fried chicken on television    but perhaps he should have chosen turkey instead a sequel to the 2011 film puss in boots itself a spinoff from the shrek movies this one gives us florence pugh as the voice of goldilocks with olivia colman and ray winstone as mama and papa bear as youll have gathered joel crawfords film like the original boasts an eclectic mix of characters from legends and fairy tales jack horner john mulaney is an obese hunchbacked villain and there are cameos for pinocchio jiminy cricket excalibur and the big bad wolf puss brilliantly voiced by banderas is a swashbuckling zorrostyle hero fearless until the wolf ruins things by pointing out that he has used up eight of his nine lives if he can find the elusive wishing star alongside his old flame kitty softpaws salma hayek puss can get his eight lives back but everyone else is searching for the wishing star too including for more nefarious reasons the monstrous jack horner and the crime family of goldilocks and the three bears its very imaginatively done as in puss in boots the last wish see below theres a fairytale ending of sorts in to leslie  but a lot of bleakness precedes it as the title character andrea riseborough lurches broke and homeless through a miserable alcoholsodden existence six years after winning the texas lottery this lowbudget film a debut feature for british director michael morris has been basking in some mostly welcome attention after riseborough pictured very unexpectedly landed a best actress oscar nomination i say mostly because there are some crying foul not to mention racism the africanamerican actress danielle deadwyler brilliant in till was overlooked but there is no doubt its a performance worthy of acclaim at the heart of a tale patsy cline might once have expressed in song last seen gurning her way hilariously through the matilda movie riseborough a tynesider note proves her impressive versatility by convincing utterly as a texan deadbeat who steals from her teenage son and seems beyond redemption before returning to her home town and with the support of a good man piecing her life back together
Feb 3 2023,positive, its a pleasant surprise when the film that isnt quite shrek 5 turns out to be the best of that sequence its an even bigger surprise to discover that puss in boots the last wish is a compelling companion piece to pedro almodóvars pain and glory in which a declining film practitioner antonio banderas ponders his mortality the sequel to pusss 2011 standalone adventure sees the swashbuckling feline in fearful contemplation upon realising that he is down to the last of his nine lives my prescription says the cats doctor and barber no more adventures you need to retire thus pursued by a glaivewielding big bad wolf wagner moura puss buries his iconic footwear and settles down to a life defined by kibble and naps at a cat ladys refuge the nicestlooking animation to emerge from the dreamworks imprint takes cues from the treasure of the sierra madre and spaghetti western films  notably the good the bad and the ugly  as puss takes up with his scorned old flame kitty softpaws salma hayek pinault and a cheerful unwanted therapy dog harvey guillén on a search for a wishing star that can recoup his lost lives kevin mccanns jimmy stewartinspired conscience cricket makes for fun commentary on last years many pinnochios the chaotic codfairytale references dont always land  the bakers dozen anyone  but few actors are as suited to their animated avatars as banderas is to puss there is a lot to like here not least ray winstones papa bear the forests are skittlecoloured the set pieces are wild and kinetic but it is banderass star power that saves the day
Feb 3 2023,positive, the second solo adventure for antonio banderass ginger zorro grossed 309million before it even opened in the uk not bad for the followup to a shrek spinoff from 11 years ago this time puss must forgo the senoritas the swashbuckling and the fullfat milk swilling due to an accident at work after defeating a rampaging troll a falling church bell cuts short the showboating when he comes round the doctor informs him he has just exhausted eight of his nine lives so our oncecarefree hero ditches his floppy hat and boots to wander naked into mama lanas cat rescue for a life of tasteless cat biscuits and smelly litter trays forming a triple act with a clingy dog called perrito harvey guillen and old flame kitty softpaws salma hayek pinault he sets out to find the mystical wishing star the quest will see them battle a fearsome wolf wagner moura cockney gangsters goldilocks florence pugh and the three bears ray winstone olivia colman and samson kayo and the nowmassive jack horner john mulaney who appears to have outgrown his good boy days but stuck with the pieeating but the animation is gorgeous the action is zippy and banderas is brilliant after a lean few months for family animation kids and parents should lap this one up
Feb 3 2023,positive, until this year my only puss in bootsrelated wish was that i would never have to sit through another film from the shrek franchise as long as i lived i must confess the unexpectedly entertaining puss in boots the last wish has entirely changed my mind puss in boots antonio banderas squandered eight of his nine lives with a devilmaycare panache he sang danced and swashbuckled his way through a legendary series of adventures but his melodious pursuit of a giant may have seen the bell toll for the last time on those carefree days then a standoff with a foe who cannot be quipped into submission shakes the marmalade marauder to his core what happens when the charismatic poster puss of living for tomorrow suddenly fears he will not make it through today mortality is a mighty foe for puss the answer is to put his life of crime to rest burying his broadbrimmed hat cape and trademark corinthian leather boots and any expectation of further adventure beside them soon his razorsharp claws are sheathed in mittens and he is growing fluffy and docile in the home of mama luna davine joy randolph with dozens of languid cat brethren and an alarmingly optimistic chihuahua for company puss in boots the last wish does something refreshing for a childrens film it takes a long unflinching look at anxiety exploring it with a frankness that people of any age who have been frozen with similar dread will appreciate dreamworks latest production is certainly not the first time animation studios have ventured into mental health territory in recent years but the vivid depictions of panic are singular and they truly captivate the peerless spiderman into the spiderverse continues to be a force for good in this world this time by inspiring the last wishs tactile and visuallyengaging animation its vivid storybook aesthetic is a far cry from the cg monotony of this franchises last outing and helps sell the heavier moments as is the way with family features there are still some everything but the kitchen sink scenes but there are also moments of striking artistry in silhouettes angular crystals the stomp of a giant and the swish of a skirt plot threads get messy on the chase and here your mind will wander with the least coherent character animation and a shoehorned story tangent john mulaneys jack horner is surplus to requirement and his contribution drags still he does have a jimmy stewartesque cricket kevin mccann in his dastardly bag of tricks so its not all bad and the irresistible charm of the central friendship journey paired with heitor perreiras buoyant score further wash away the tedium puss in boots the last wish is a heartfelt adventure caper that tackles anxiety with surprising empathy and wit a few cast members should have been lost in the woods but overall this ones a winner
Feb 3 2023,positive, move over brendan fraser youre not the only noughties family film icon making a comeback this week eleven years after his last cinema appearance here is antonio banderass puss in boots again  or rather poos in booze as the name is rendered in the velvety spanish purr that helped make the character a favourite in the later shrek films and clearly the industry at least is glad to have him back since the film has been nominated in the best animation categories at the coming oscars and baftas after a long career of zorrolike swashbuckling the last wish finds puss on the ninth and last of his lives but in no mood to shuffle off to the franchise graveyard just yet so when word reaches him of a wishing star that has fallen in a faraway forest he sets out to retrieve it in the hope its powers will allow him to postpone the inevitable for a little while yet other interested parties are also on the trail however including a vivienne westwoodesque goldilocks florence pugh and her three bear accomplices ray winstone olivia colman and samson kayo and also jack horner john mulaney a nolongersolittle fruit pie magnate harbouring an inferiority complex over his nurseryrhyme roots this is supposedly a film about coming to terms with death  and death itself even makes a series of deliciously scary cameo appearances in the form of a wolf voiced by narcos wagner moura whose red eyes thin smile and silver sickles glint from beneath his black hooded cloak but aside from the chills elicited by this genuinely spooky figure the film is almost defiantly hopeless at emotion the tone is teethgnashingly manic throughout while the underlying point of pusss quest is obscured by continuous flurries of slapstick and quips sometimes its quite funny  the sequence in which puss and salma hayeks kitty softpaws try to outcute one another by pulling increasingly adorable faces is a nice escalation of a series running gag and occasionally its spectacular too thanks to frequentwell lets be generous and say homages to classic action scenes from japanese anime buffs will recognise shots borrowed from neon genesis evangelion and attack on titan within the first five minutes alone in which puss loses life number eight in a battle with a moss giant rather than ploughing on with shreks now dated visual style dreamworks has smartly adopted the stylish hybrid look pioneered by sony animations into the spiderverse which combines elements of handdrawn and cg theres an entire pick n mix stand of eye candy here  more than enough to satisfy younger viewers but alas its all empty calories
Feb 3 2023,positive, there he can grow a beard eat disgusting dry cat food and avoid the bounty hunter wolf who is keen to get his dead body and claim a reward and along with new friend perrito harvey guillen  a dog who is dressed as a cat to enjoy the luxury of the sanctuary  and his old friend kitty softpaws salma hayek they go on a mission to try to find it the journey is a dangerous one with entry into the black forest and the trio are soon up against gangster family goldilocks florence pugh and the three bears ray winstone olivia colman and samson kayo who are also on a bid for the wishing star there are some incredibly daring action sequences and horner and the bounty hunter wolf are both dreadful enough to keep you fearing for our furry friends life banderas brings all the usual joy and energy to the character he made his own and uses just the right amount of humour in the role too loving couple andrew and eric are vacationing with their adoptive daughter wen at a secluded cabin when four armed strangers led by dave bautistas leonard turn up tight pacing from the getgo maintains a nervy edge as these four individuals demand the family make a harrowing choice kill one of their family to prevent the apocalypse or let the world burn paired with moving performances that capture a huge range of emotions this is one of the rare shyamalan films not to require a plot twist to succeed just sharp empathetic direction acting and writing which reminds you that he is a filmmaker who loves to play with good and bad hero and villain and happiness and suffering to get audiences asking philosophical questions of themselves too the opening scene of this darren aronofsky film shows a supermorbidly obese man surrounded by debris in his dingy room watching pornography that gives him a heart attack hes a teacher of english but only does this via zoom where he pretends his camera has broken so his students can never see him the only other characters are those who visit including his friend liz hong chau who is a nurse but also his enabler his spiky estranged daughter ellie sadie sink exwife mary samantha morton and missionary thomas ty simpkins  but its fraser who is the outright star of this masterful film giving such a powerful performance that it will leave even the hardest heart broken
Feb 2 2023,positive, nineteen years after his first appearance in shrek 2 and ten after his first spinoff movie antonio banderas swings back into action as puss in boots the animated films financial success has sparked speculation about a fifth shrek movie but is there really anything more to be squeezed from this longrunning series we reunite with puss in boots voiced by banderas who is going through an existential crisis after a mishap means that he has used eight of his nine lives he retires from adventuring and becomes depressed however he finds out about a map that leads to a magical wishing star stealing the map and reuniting with exfiance kitty soft paws salma hayek puss in boots races to find the star considering how long the character has been away it would be easy for the film to opt for a soft easy subject that keeps the franchise going looking at you minions however taking on as serious a subject as death however whimsically gives the story just enough depth to keep things interesting yes most of the action is devoted to familiar slapstick and wacky side characters but finding a reason to exist is the golden ticket for any sequel and director joel crawford the croods a new age accomplishes it while the story feels fresher the characters are broadly the same hayek and banderas have had great chemistry on screen for decades and the added element of animation doesnt change that winning formula recognisable voices like olivia colman florence pugh and ray winstone keep the giggles coming while john mulaney is a proven delight if you are expecting something that will reinvigorate the genre this will be a disappointment however what puss in boots the last wish lacks in originality it makes up for in laughs and heart
Feb 2 2023,positive, puss in boots the last wish is a heartfelt surprisingly mature look at life and death from one heroic cats perspective read our review of the oscarnominated animation  originally a character introduced in shrek 2 puss in boots was an instant fan favourite the characters solo film a little unimaginatively titled puss in boots premiered in 2011 and its taken 11 years to get a sequel to that  at the beginning of the last wish puss voiced by antonio banderas finds himself on the last of his nine lives even fearless swashbuckling kitties will have to face death eventually but puss is keen on continuing his adventures and desperately needs some extra lives  he sets out to find a magical wishing star which could grant him more time on earth joining him is his exfiancee kitty softpaws voiced by salma hayek still the villainous goldilocks florence pugh and the three bears olivia colman ray winstone and samson kayo are after the map to the wishing star too  as you can see the voice cast to the last wish is stacked like really stacked oscar nominees and winners left right and centre of it theres always something very giddy about hearing your favourite actor do a particularly fun voice performance florence pugh is the highlight here clearly having a ball doing a heightened cockney accent that somehow never feels out of place in this world her goldilocks is an excellent addition to the world of shrek firmly rooted in fairy tales but also given a surprising amount of depth here antonio banderas as per usual is also pitchperfect as the titular cat his voice is sultry and seducing so much so that it feels a little wrong for a kids film the same goes for salma hayek their vocal chemistry is off the charts making the last wish a treat for kiddos and adults alike  perhaps thats the biggest strength of the film its very clearly a kids film most of the comedy is pure slapstick but the storyline feels much more mature than previous dreamworks animated efforts its not exactly groundbreaking stuff plotwise but the last wish feels distinctly more ambitious than its predecessor  the last wish also reaches for the sky with its animation style the film mixes several different styles which gives it a sense of prestige the last wish clearly wants to hit the same notes that spiderman into the spiderverse did animation is a genre that is constantly evolving and the last wish successfully blends different styles together for a dynamic end result even if none of it is quite as memorable or zeitgeisty as desired  there is also something uncanny about the human character design in the first sequence in which puss is hosting a lavish party the human faces look disneyfied with unnaturally large eyes this brings the film down a tad but thankfully the story is what really keeps the last wish going  the last wish is funny enough to appeal to kids but its also honest enough to entertain adults there are plenty of references to other fairy tales occasionally making the last wish feel like a game of bingo the film also holds a potent if uninspired message about appreciating and living your life to the fullest  puss in boots the last wish is a worthy sequel and dreamworks animations most ambitious visually striking film in years with stellar voice performances from banderas hayek and pugh the last wish has cemented its place as a great sequel and a superb animated film   the sitting duck unveils the gripping journey of trade unionist maureen kearney brilliantly portrayed by isabelle huppert amidst harrowing political intrigue and personal hardship   the sitting duck unveils the gripping journey of trade unionist maureen kearney brilliantly portrayed by isabelle huppert amidst harrowing political intrigue and personal hardship
Feb 2 2023,negative, somewhat mystifyingly some topsecret algorithmic function in dreamworks animations audiencereaction data analysis software has decreed that yet another comeback is in order for the sort of okish and mehplus character of puss in boots smokily voiced by antonio banderas originally seen in 2004 in shrek 2 and then in the 2010 spinoff feature puss in boots the numbers have come chuntering out of the side of some giant ibmstyle computer the suits have frowningly inspected them and another tranche of puss in boots content has been greenlit once again debonair outlaw puss in boots  a sort of cleanedup southern european version of jack sparrow  is having swordtwirling adventures again in the company of his paramour kitty softpaws salma hayek but now pib must confront his own mortality having used up eight of his nine lives he is on a quest to put off the evil hour by finding the legendary wishing star which once fell to earth like a comet he and kitty join forces with the perky mutt perrito harvey guillén but must battle other fairytalenurseryrhyme honchos including a cockney crime family in the form of goldilocks florence pugh and the three bears olivia colman ray winstone and samson kayo and big jack horner john mulaney  to whom all the funny lines are given wagner moura voices the wolf who is the grim reaper wielding a couple of sickles really this movie is a huge 102minute additional scene something that would go on the extras package of a bluray edition of the previous puss in boots film or possibly get its own videoondemand release it feels like something to put on your tv or ipad to pacify a toddler nothing wrong with that of course and many stressed parents would call it the noblest artistic calling but how bland and forgettable this film is without in the smallest way harnessing the real performing power of banderas colman pugh winstone et al
Feb 1 2023,positive,funny poignant beautifully animated an absolute delight for children and adults hands down one of the best films of the year
Feb 1 2023,positive, after pi requiem for a dream the wrestler and black swan darren aronofsky takes his appetite for corporeal punishment to new levels with the whale a grim tale of compulsive selfloathing rendered as an oscarbaiting redemption story brendan fraser takes the lead as charlie a morbidly obese gay shutin eating himself to death in response to the grief he feels over the unexpected death of his partner and the family he lost when he came out estranged from his exwife and teenage daughter he lives alone teaching college writing classes online a gig that allows him to stay hidden from the world he disables his webcam during zoom classes while feeding his excessive junk food addiction with daily takeout orders that charlie is a guy whose heart has literally and figuratively been broken by years of selfabuse shame and guilt is made clear in the opening scenes masturbating to gay porn he has a seizure and has to be rescued by a doorstepping missionary whom he coaxes into reading an extract from a student essay on moby dick that calms him down enough to prevent a full cardiac arrest the significance of the essay will be revealed much later though charlie reads it again and again treating it as an emotional crutch as vital to his ability to get through each day as the actual walkingframe he needs to get around his cramped apartment for the duration of the movie fraser is buried beneath the sweaty folds and distended bulges of a 300pound prosthetic suit a physical transformation that all but guaranteed his oscar nomination before the film even came out he brings what dignity he can to the role you can read the sadness in his eyes as a sympathetic reflection of someone trapped by the extremity of their situation but theres a whiff of freakshow leeriness to his presentation too  and the additional use of charlies sexuality as a catalyst for his tragic situation is another wellworn oscar trope aronofsky also revels a little too much in charlies zoo or aquariumlike existence deploying a boxy aspect ratio to accentuate the already tight confines of his apartment and providing him with a parade of curious visitors and caretakers among them his best friend liz hong chau also oscar nominated thomas ty simpkins the aforementioned missionary and eventually charlies daughter ellie stranger things star sadie sink whose unhappy life charlie desperately wants to fix by sacrificing his own chau adds some spark here but the subplots involving simpkins and sinks characters feel contrived aronofoskys decision to embrace the films stage origins its based on screenwriter samuel d hunters play of the same name doesnt help matters either  the stripped down aesthetic only adding to the suspicion that theres not much more to this than the body horror spectacle of its central performance m night shyamalans knock at the cabin begins in exquisitely creepy fashion with a little girl called wen kristen cue happily playing in the woods as a stranger approaches the stranger is polite but looks intimidating hes played by dave bautista and wen is savvy enough not to trust him an instinct that will soon prove correct when the stranger and three friends force their way into the cabin wens dads jonathan groff and ben aldridge have rented for their vacation this being a shyamalan film what follows isnt a standard home invasion thriller adapted from paul tremblays bestseller a cabin at the end of the world its a twisty armageddonthemed horror with bautista and his cohorts played by rupert grint nikki amukabird and abby quinn an intriguing spin on the four horsemen of the apocalypse shyamalan remains great at using his camera to switch perspectives and destabilise what we think we know of a story and though he doesnt quite find a way to resolve the ambiguity of the premise without resorting to literalness in the hokey finale this and last years old suggest hes very much back on form donkeys are currently having quite the moment in arthouse films featuring in triangle of sadness the banshees of inisherin and now eo a surreal updating of robert bressons au hasard balthazar designed to provide a reflective snapshot of modernday europe by following the travails of the titular donkey as it changes ownership after being cut loose from the circus directed by veteran polish filmmaker jerzy skolimowski the film deploys impressionistic flourishes pointofview shots and even suggests eo has a romantic yearning for his former trainer mostly though this passive protagonist functions as a placid barometer of human civility isabelle huppert costars donkey doesnt feature in shrek spinoff puss in boots the last wish but given this belated sequel to 2011s original puss in boots sets up a future return to far far away dont rule out his reappearance at some point this film though finds its antonio banderasvoiced feline swashbuckler reckoning with mortality after using up eight of his nine lives the plot thus finds him on a quest to find a wishing star in the hope of restoring the lives hes recklessly frittered away a quest complicated by other fairytale characters intent on securing the wish for themselves in the tradition of shrek the film has fun deconstructing fairytale lore though what really distinguishes it is the animation which has a more painterly and pleasingly handcrafted feel florence pugh olivia colman and salma hayek pinault are among new and returning voice cast

Jan 30 2023,positive, my compliments to your cobbler says the big bad wolf wagner moura to puss in boots antonia banderas is the latest cartoon caper from dreamworks given that this is the first sequel to a spinoff to the sherk franchise which is pretty much played out since igniting the cgi animation world back check notes 22 years ago anticipation was pretty limited for this one expectations aside its a light fluffy adventure with plenty of knowing gags whether you love cats or not joel crawfords film is not a load of old cobblers nor one from the bottom of the litter tray a lavish quick offthe mark action set piece shows us that puss in boots is getting old a giant bell falls squarely on his furry little nog and a doctor suggests that he has now used up eight of his nine lives a chance encounter with the big bad wolf makes a cowardly cat of our hero who buries his heroic garb and decides to sit out any potential conflicts but puss is being sought after by goldilocks and the three bears who are seeking the wishing star that can grant one single wish of course puss in boots wants nothing more than to get his eight lives back and goes off in search accompanied by kitty softpaws voiced by salma hayek as a dreamworks animation this is still a cut above most florence pugh is goldilocks and olivia colman and ray winstone are mama and papa bear respectively but the mvp here is comic john mulaney who brings a louche yet manic energy to little jack horner one of several nursery rhyme characters who get pressed into service here appreciating what youve got and not betting it all on imponderables is the clear message here and the last wish just about delivers it with some lively voice work and a rather more dynamic animation feel than the previous entry in the franchise given the films striking boxoffice success as counterprogramming to the avatar sequel its unlikely that this will be the last we see of puss while a little darker than the other shrek films its charming and cute enough to satisfy family audiences gags like puss claiming i am a master of the baking suggest a little of the old shrek humour for adults creeping in and while the formula is aging like the furrball protagonist puss in boots is the cats pyjamas as far as comfort food for kids goes this demo site is only for demonstration purposes all images are copyrighted to their respective owners all content cited is derived from their respective sources
Jan 29 2023,positive, once upon a time there was a cat who was hired to get rid of an ogre however he was no match for the ogre or his trusty steed so it joined them on their quest to live happily ever after little did they know that this bootwearing hispanic cat would become a hero in its own right while expanding the world of fairy tales for audiences worldwide 12 years after his first solo film puss in boots antonio banderas returns in an overdue sequel puss in boots the last wish starring a starstudded cast the swashbuckling feline ventures on a quest through the mysterious dark forest to find a wishing star  but he is not the only one ever since we first met puss in boots in shrek 2 his character has been all about the legend that is puss in boots however this latest instalment sees his legacy claim eight of his nine lives through his own amusing arrogance worried about what his life will become if he died or worse was a normal cat he chooses to hide away from death or a big bad wolf voiced by wagner maura and resign to the mundane life of a house cat but when puss hears about a wishing star that can replenish his lost lives he decides to take on goldi florence pugh and the three bears olivia colman ray winstone and samson kayo as well as magic collector big jack horner john mulaney to find it  with the help of a new canine companion harvey guillén and love interest kitty softpaws salma hayek pinault as we enter the sixth instalment of the shrek franchise audiences have already seen a lot of wellknown fairy tale characters reimagined during its over20year history but puss in boots the last wish seem to continue the series magic of reviving famous characters in a mostly villainous and hilarious way in this instalment goldilocks and the three bears are reimagined as a crime family think the mitchells from eastenders and nursery rhyme character big jack horner has grown up to run a huge pie corporation with a grudge against fairy tale magic paul fisher and tommy swerdlows screenplay allows the characters to find their way without being heavyhearted everyone is quite selfish regarding their respective wishes whether it is new lives a family or their own happy ever after but everyone along with puss and kitty softpaws is relentless in their pursuit of the wishing star to comical effect the screenplay also allows them to display some vulnerability and frustration with their own circumstances enabling them to slowly appreciate what they have rather than crave something superficial although goldi and the bears allow their family dynamic to sometimes dampen their effectiveness as fairy tale gangsters one of the other new additions is a consistent scenestealer referred to as purrito the overexcited sockwearing pup offers buckets of enthusiasm and charm without delving into oversentimentalism but it is his empathy that makes him such a great addition  in a franchise where a lot of characters are all about their own desires purrito is happy to appreciate what is in front of him despite his ignorance of his tragic puphood his ambition to be a therapy dog also delivers sweet moments and makes him a great buffer between the antisocial bickering yet adorable felines the vast array of characters allows director joel crawford to make the most of the films eclectic voice cast mainstays banderas and hayek pinault are consistently brilliant with pugh colman winston and kayo amping up the cockney gangster vibe as goldi and the three bears additional credit goes to guillén maura and mulaney for their respective performances as their characters help bring complexity to the table following last years the bad guys dreamworks continues to incorporate a grittier animation style after the success of into the spiderverse this sees less detail in the intricacy of the characters but elevates the action scenes to a comic book style while retaining the fantastical elements worthy of a fairy tale overall puss in boots the last wish is a brilliantly entertaining instalment of the shrek franchise with dazzling colours great characters and jokes galore it is unadulterated family entertainment
Jan 28 2023,positive, youd be forgiven for thinking that the shrek franchise was on its last life by now while the 2001 original and its evenfunnier 2004 sequel shook up the status quo with their sharp disneyfairytale satire diminishing returns saw the anarchic ogres impact dwindle over time its fair to say then that puss in boots the last wish  a sequel to a spinoff that graced cinema screens over a decade ago  doesnt arrive with much momentum behind it that it frequently explodes into sequences of vital visually dazzling capitalc cinema is a truly unexpected delight in its opening 15 minutes its clear that the last wish is fighting tooth and claw to exceed expectations  kicking off with a kinetic kitty versus kaiju setpiece that reestablishes the legendary status of puss in boots for an audience who have likely long moved on antonio banderas who originated the role way back in shrek 2 returns to voice the zorrostyled lechelapping swashbuckler whose diminutive stature belies feats of highwire heroism taking on a mosscovered mountain beast with only his rapier its an eyeboggling pulsepounding sequence gorgeously animated in striking digitalpaint brushstrokes and intentionally stuttering spiderverseesque framerate effects the effect is dazzling  once again its apparent that spiderverse has upped the game of every animation studio in town the last wish capitalises on that with visual flourishes that bring real dynamism to its action scenes breaking away from the homogenous stylings of late00s 3d animation to deliver ultraexpressive impressionistic imagery that boundarypushing extends to the themes explored here too  if younger viewers wont necessarily be familiar with puss in boots himself they also likely wont be expecting a treatise on mortality and ptsd but thats the last wishs central preoccupation as puss realises his nine lives have dwindled down to one capped off in a hilarious moggymurdermontage and that death itself is rapidly approaching with stakes this high notions this existential and a superhero this hairy it often plays like a kidfriendly logan everything exceptional about the last wish makes the more generic elements stand out such as the supporting characters some of which dont quite sing a gangsterfamily goldilocks florence pugh and the three bears ray winstone olivia colman and samson kayo wring few laughs while villain jack horner john mulaney also feels like a distraction but in most regards the last wish is a minor miracle  visually daring frequently funny and surprisingly emotional against all the odds it could bring the shrek series back to allstar status

Jan 22 2023,positive, one of the great surprises of the 2022 movie season puss in boots the last wish  is a fun sequel we never knew we needed blends comedy action and some tender moments the panic attack scene is a powerful memory while also reuniting antonio banderas and salma hayek pinault in a winning and wonderful way i suppose if you were not a fan of shrek films or the previous puss in boots film from 2011 this may be of little to no interest to you though it has near unanimous acclaim some feel the film is convoluted borrows from other film concepts and is thin on plot and story not my take but it is a take that is out there sometimes you just have to tip your hat and puss in boots the last wish is the sequel i never thought i needed though a fan of the first shrek films where the antonio banderasvoiced puss in boots character first debuted i was rather lackluster on the banderasled spinoff in 2011 puss in boots had a couple fun moments some fun banter between banderas and salma hayek pinaults kitty softpaws and the oooohhh cat who became a meme for a number of years on social media however the 2011 film is largely forgettable and nothing i have revisited since watching it all those years agoand so imagine my surprise when minutes into the sequel i am laughing rather heartily or stepping back and admiring the different animation techniques used to establish characters and distinguish between feelings of fear arrogance and the normal lookandfeel of the shrek and shrekadjacent movies banderas performance is full of energy and vitality the movie begins at a brisk pace packed with grand enthusiasm suffice to say this film feels a whole lot different than its predecessorin the last wish puss learns he must live more carefully and with less brazen risk after he is brought back by his doctor following an unfortunate encounter with a massive bell puss realizes he has used up eight of his nine lives with only one life left puss begins to rationalize changes he needs to make while also encountering a grim reaperstyle wolf wagner moura who haunts him seemingly at every turnthough it can feel intense and younger viewers may have a need to snuggle up with someone they trust when the striking menacing wolf arrives on screen the last wish is largely a breeze to hide away from the wolf puss hides out in a cat sanctuary run by the sweettempered mama luna davine joy randolph one of a few dozen cats overseen by mama luna puss resigns himself to being a housecat giving up his swashbuckling adventurous life for that of a plain old domestic over time a new arrival a chihuahua in disguise named perrito a scenestealing harvey guillén becomes an ally the stakes amplify when goldilocks florence pugh shows up along with her three bears to claim a ransom on puss when puss learns that the opportunity to gain a wish comes in the form of the wishing star he seeks to find the star even if it means he runs up against another potential danger in big jack horner the large grownup version of little jack horner voiced by john mulaney  sometimes you just have to tip your hat and puss in boots the last wish is the sequel i

fx series what we do in the shadows is tremendous the animation is especially impressive mixing different styles and looks depending on the nature of the threat and the scene while jack horner looks bulbous and large a bit overthetop though if being honest the wolf has a stark intense presence that feels different than anything else in the film the shrek franchise certainly has its distinctive presentation which is visible here but the backdrops and the details are much more enhanced than i remember even when the story lags or much of the action takes place in the center of the screen a constant frustration with american animation letting your eyes wander around and take in whats in the background reaps some great rewardsmaybe the bar was set low but even with too many villains and a reliance on a few too many action and fight scenes puss in boots the last wish is quite the fun surprise to uncover at years end director joel crawford and codirector januel mercado have found a way

Jan 20 2023,positive, there i said it i may get criticized i may get canceled i may get banned from shrekfest for life but i needed to speak my truth the puss in boots movies both the 2011 original and the new sequel the last wish run circles around the shrek movies they spun off from much of the charm of puss in boots is due to the voice acting of antonio banderas whose rumbottlewrappedinvelvet purr is hilarious hes an orange tabby whos also a swashbuckling adventurer very much in the vein of zorro who banderas played in 1998s the mask of zorro puss even carves a p into the shirt of one of his adversaries with his sword in case you missed the connection the last wish opens with puss at the top of his game singing swinging and slashing his way through bad guys including a lumbering giant in the colorful opening sequence the animation style has even upped its game as well  the computergenerated 3d is given colorful textures that look like they were made with a paintbrush during the fight scenes the frame rate of the animation drops a little making the action a little choppier but more dynamic to watch puss does get smashed by the giant  but hes got nine lives so what does he care except that his doctor has been keeping score and informs puss that hes already used up eight of them theres a funny montage of all eight of his deaths including ignoring a shellfish allergy now a wolf grim reaper is stalking puss patiently waiting for death no 9 which leaves puss not feeling so footloose and fancy free puss tries retiring from the swashbuckling game and gets adopted by a cat lady davine joy randolph but the simple life doesnt stick reunited with his old love interestrival the master thief kitty softpaws salma hayek puss heads off on a quest to find the wishing star that can restore his spent eight lives also on the trail of the star in a treasure of the sierra madrestyle plot are goldilocks florence pugh and the three bears olivia colman ray winstone and samson kayo who seem like storybook characters as written by guy ritchie and jack horner john mulaney who has turned his love of pies into a criminal enterprise is also on the hunt directed by joel crawford and codirected januel mercado the last wish consistently delivers good jokes for young and old dazzling visuals and an earnest message about living the life youve got banderas and hayek have been screen partners from 1995s desperado to this years black comedy official competition and they have a warm chemistry here as the feuding cats but the two feline thieves almost have the movie stolen from them by harvey guillen of what we do in the shadows as a guileless mutt named perro who latches onto the pairs quest it might be time for a spinoff of the spinoff featuring perro share your opinion on this topic by sending a letter to the editor to tctvoicemadisoncom include your full name hometown and phone number your name and town will be published the phone number is for verification purposes only please keep your letter to 250 words or less
Jan 19 2023,positive, plot puss in boots is back and this time he is nearly out of his nine lives thankfully he may have an answer with the legend of a lost star that can grant a single wish he and his pals seek out this magical item in hopes to prolong his kitty lives review the cat is back over a decade after the first catcentric adventure puss in boots the last wish makes a swashbuckling return to the big screen antonio banderas is back as puss along with his onandoff romantic interest kitty softpaws salma hayek this time the cast includes a goodhearted undercover puppy played by by the scenestealer harvey guillén florence pugh as goldilocks and her three bears olivia coleman samson kayo and ray winstone are all terrific john mulaney shows up as the adult version of jack horner  if you remember the nursery rhyme  and he embraces it rather well and william moura is delightfully wicked as the big bad wolf hunting down the legendary furball and yes animated adventures are in season with this delightful family film from dreamworks after an impressive opening celebration in the town of all things puss the cat faces the fact that he is on the last of his nine lives having been warned that he must end his adventurous ways he is convinced to become a lapcat however puss fate is not with cat lady devine joy randolph unfortunately for him the big bad wolf a bounty hunter is hot on his trail to take him in however you cant keep puss down when he runs into an old friend the sly kitty softpaws hayek the two find themselves hunting for a legendary star that will grant one final wish with only one life left puss is desperate to find a magical gift to grant someone the legend of the last wish yet kitty puss and their adorable companion perro harvey guillén arent the only ones on the prowl puss in boots the last wish starts with a bang the opening action sequence is surprisingly exciting and yes it all leads to many humorous adventures even still the joel crawford and januel mercadodirected feature is just as thrilling as it is charming the entire premise of searching for what could grant the most potent wish brings a sense of wonder and thrills within the world the characters must follow a map that leads them on dangerous roads which appear impossible to maneuver through yet the way they find their destination is decidedly exciting the last wish works on many levels its a visual treat with a sweet script and it also mixes humor and big blockbuster moments rather well antonio banderas and salma hayek make for a great onscreen duo once again the two balance each other perfectly with their terrific vocal performances one scene where they try and out cute each other had me laughing quite literally out loud that happened a few times and thats an absolute joy to feel while watching an animated flick the side characters add to the fun harvey guillén brings on the adorableness of perro florence pugh is a firecracker as goldilocks along with the three bears beautifully done by olivia colman ray winstone and samson kayo and if you want a couple of solid shreklike bad guys we got em wagner mouras big bad wolf and john mulaneys jack horner offer clever villainy for a movie like this ultimately the sequel brings the visual flair and the enjoyable characters to the forefront the script manages a return to the charms of the shrekinspired franchise way back when mike myers brought an edge to the fairy tale come to life and with this theres much for adults as well even the premise within the script written by tommy swerdlow and paul fisher handles aging in an entertaining yet heartfelt way the final act has a sweet message that will charm even the most cynical viewers the last wish is a sequel that manages to bring back much of the magic from before all the way back to when we first were introduced to this fantastical far far away and yes the new film does tie into that in an inspired way puss in boots the last wish is a solid return for the imaginative and comedic fairy tale world as a sequel to a film from 2011 the magic holds up better than one may expect the cast is great and the visuals are wildly impressive the sequel may not change how we see animated cinema but it will undoubtedly bring laughs aplenty to the whole family i was smiling ear to ear for most of this feature and yes even i found myself curious to see if we can have yet another good sequel from the land that is far far away if you still long for shrek and friends youll be happy to hear that this is a witty and actionpacked return to that quirky and comedic magic we have compiled a list of everything we know about 28 years later a trilogy of sequels to danny boyle and alex garlands 28 days later the fall guy just hit cinemacon for a victory lap after premiering at sxsw does it live up to the hype and give ryan gosling a clasic role
Jan 19 2023,positive, a sequel to 2011s puss in boots puss in boots the last wish follows antonio banderas title character as he teams up with kitty softpaws salma hayek pinault and perrito harvey guillén to track down the mystical last wish for the wishing star its clear ultimately that puss in boots the last wish is at its best in its lighthearted and frequently funny opening stretch as filmmaker joel crawford armed with paul fisher and tommy swerdlows screenplay has suffused the proceedings with a brisk tongueincheek sensibility thats heightened by a smattering of agreeable jokes and digressions eg a montage of exactly how puss lost eight of his nine lives  with the watchable vibe heightened by banderas and his various costars amusing voice work john mulaneys largerthanlife turn as the villainous jack horner remains a highlight to be sure theres little doubt then that puss in boots the last wishs overall impact is hindered by a hitandmiss midsection that places far too pronounced an emphasis on loud overthetop action sequences ie its all just so frenetic and the movie which admittedly does conclude on a relatively satisfying note does feel like it mightve benefited from both a shorter running time and a more lowkey execution  with the final result a decentenough animated endeavor that could and should have been so much better
Jan 19 2023,positive,will lessons imparted about the appreciating what we have fly over the heads of younger kids possibly will offhanded references to drowning puppies possibly not
Jan 19 2023,positive, the shrek franchise is a muddled one at best the first film is fantastic and shrek 2 is decent while shrek the third and shrek forever after just drain a tired ogres swamp for everything its worth the overall disappointment with where the franchise headed in later sequels put off the desire to ever see the 2011 puss in boots film however it may be worth a visit now since puss in boots the last wish is so exceptionally great and the best animated film of the year  directed by joel crawford and januel mercado the croods a new age with a story by tommy swerdlow the grinch and tom wheeler puss in boots and a screenplay by paul fisher the lego ninjago movie and tommy swerdlow puss in boots the last wish has an animation style that is drastically different from the realistic style youve come to associate with shrek and puss in boots utilizing drastic perspectives action sequences that slow down to emphasize major blows before speeding up again and different frame rates to give characters and enemies unique movements puss in boots the last wish is visually similar to the likes of spiderman into the spiderverse and the bad guys the film is essentially a race to the star to see who can get the wish first puss is accompanied by a female cat named kitty softpaws salma hayek their troubled past keeps them in constant conflict when puss briefly retires as a hero he meets a therapy dog named perrito harvey guillen who is now convinced they are best friends is happy about everything and doesnt want to wish for anything standing in the way of puss and his wish is the criminal masterminds goldilocks florence pugh papa bear ray winstone mama bear olivia colman and baby bear samson kayo and the relentless and magicobsessed jack horner john mulaney like shrek puss in boots the last wish toys with being more adult than the average animated film visually dark at times with flashes of red and orange and constant close encounters with death the last wish also deals with more mature dialogue with both crap and hell being muttered on at least one occasion and baby being referred to as a dingleberry perrito also gets bleeped for his heavier use of vulgarity one of his more memorable sequences is when a long line of bleeps covers up his insults about the three bears hearing john mulaney as a villain of any film animated or otherwise is a bit odd and takes some getting used to mulaney is no stranger to animation as a regular on big mouth and as the voice of chip in this years disney exclusive film chip n dale rescue rangers but this is the first time mulaney hasnt exaggerated his voice into that nasal tone youve come to expect from andrew glouberman or even mulaneys own standup mulaney is more relaxed here as jack horner which only makes his angry outbursts all the more unsettling bits of comedy still drip through horners dialogue but the character is mostly heartless and mulaney delivers a startling performance to match guillermo del toros pinocchio explored a familiar tale with a different concept the wooden boy never wanted to be human pinocchio is the only character in the film not controlled by strings in a conceptually similar fashion puss in boots the last wish dives into loving the life you have and appreciating every day as if its your last rather than relying on a wish to make everything better for you while the humor is often laughoutloud funny puss actually goes through some severe character development over the course of the last wish he matures and goes in an unexpected direction the way the film reopens the door to future installments is masterfully subtle in a way that doesnt feel like obvious sequel bait as well puss in boots the last wish is stylish and fun with sleek animation a thrillingly adventurous story offthewall humor and fantastic writing that is penned in a way that rejuvenates what was thought to be a dead cgi animated franchise
Jan 19 2023,positive, kids may pick up some words in spanish if they dont already know them from perritos model they can learn the value of positive thinking and of supporting your friends family is where you find it who you make it if we only have one life to live we should make the most of it and surround ourselves with those we love fame can be lonely and its pursuit ultimately meaningless true connections with others are more valuable puss ultimately realizes how much he cares for others in his life and makes sacrifices for them kitty softpaws sets resentment aside to rescue puss and perrito and work with them as a team perritos positive outlook makes his lifes path much easier hes a good and loyal friend goldilocks and the bears seek out trouble but are a strong family unit jack horner is a clear villain but his backstory does attempt to give him some relatability voice cast is led by spanish and latino actors banderas hayek guillén etc who mix spanish words and phrases into their dialogue and singing other lead characters are voiced by international actors mostly from the united states england brazil a minor character a woman who takes in stray cats is black but fat is used as an insult and jack horners sizeshape is suggested to be part of what makes him unappealing characters face frequent threats including death in the form of a scary assassin wolf puss is killed in an early scene but comes back to life because hes a cat he then reviews the comical ways he was killed eight previous times including being shot out of a cannon being squashed by a heavy weight

laps up milk in a bar parents need to know that puss in boots the last wish  which centers on popular shrek 2 character puss in boots voiced by antonio banderas  ratchets up the franchises peril a

his pursuit of the mystical last wish which could restore his squandered lives puss encounters a series of other menacing characters ominous situations and violent fights with swords knives and other weapons but he also learns lessons about the value of positive thinking working with others and prioritizing loved ones over selfish pursuits the voice cast led by a spanish and latino cast peppers

hes unexpectedly killed at the start of puss in boots the last wish as hes brought back to life hes warned that he has now run through eight of his nine lives the reality of his mortality fills puss with a newfound fear of death this is amplified by the menacing wolf wagner moura who begins pursuing him promising to take his last life puss goes into hiding at a cat rescue home where he meets an innocent and lonely chihuahua perrito harvey guillén who clings to puss as his new best friend one day the three bears olivia colman ray winstone and samson kayo and goldilocks florence pugh show up at puss hideout and the cat overhears their plans to make off with a magical map that will lead them to the mystical last wish  which could perhaps be the secret of regaining his immortality puss takes off perrito on his tail to find the map and make his wish en route he encounters more threats especially jack horner john mulaney and runs into old flame kitty softpaws salma hayek pinault shreks charismatic cat buddy is back in fine form in this actionpacked sequel but puss in boots the last wish might have done well to focus more on its characters both familiar and new and less on the nonstop action the chase and fight scenes are visually impressive but narratively they get old quickly what doesnt get old is puss smug confidence in his feline fierceness and fearless hero status  or adorable newcomer perritos innate goodness its almost a letdown when the fantabulous opening musical number gives way to a traditional chase and fight scene the voice cast  led by banderas love interest hayek and newcomer guillén as the charming chihuahua  is once again purrfect and the movie throws in quite a bit of spanish in ways both natural exclamations and complementary the soundtrack the music is one of the films standout elements overseen by brazilian composer heitor pereira the soundtrack ranges from original pieces sung by pereira and banderas or latin american stars like gaby moreno and karol g to reworked classics like a spanishinfused version of the doors the end puss own apocalypse now the storys blend of fairy tale characters can be a tad confusing  menacing villain jack horner a selfish goldilocks sometimes confused for bo peep and a big bad wolf its part of the shrek franchises personality but unrecognized characters could have functioned just as well and maybe have been less muddied allowing even more focus on the fanciful felines the reality is that many viewers will come for the cat  and this latest adventure does assure that theyll stay for the cat families can talk about what puss learns over the course of his adventures in puss in boots the last wish what do perrito and kitty softpaws show him through their own actions how do they all learn to

Jan 18 2023,positive, oh the joy of walking into a movie with no expectations as i did for puss in boots the last wish and coming away with a big goofy grin because of the abundant humor and attention to the animation detail that combine for a surprisingly delightful gem for those who dont remember puss  as charmingly voiced by antonio banderas  was a supporting player in the second shrek movie the adventuresome cat repurposed as a zorrolike swashbuckler he got his own movie in 2011 and apparently the minds at dreamworks thought he should get another one i dont really care how it happened but its wonderful that it did because puss in boots the last wish may be the best movie in the shrek franchise the movie starts with puss doing what he does best battling bad guys saving townsfolk and looking debonair doing it at the end of this particular adventure  rendered with full actionmovie adrenaline by directors joel crawford and januel mercado  puss gets crushed by the towns massive church bell well no problem for a cat with nine lives right well maybe not when puss counts up his past lives a clever montage of mishaps and misplaced bravado and realizes that hes down to his last life puss decides to retire his sword and enter a nursing home for cats  but theres only so much soft living a cat of adventure can take then he hears theres a map that can show him the location of the legendary wishing star and puss is back in action but hes not the only one looking for the map  which was purchased at great expense by the evil head of a piebaking conglomerate big jack horner voiced by comedian john mullaney puss goes to jacks lair to steal it and finds hes competing for the map with his nemesis and exgirlfriend kitty softpaws again voiced by salma hayek pinault giving us the desperado reunion we always wanted puss and kitty reluctantly join forces accompanied by an overeager chihuahua they call perro and voiced by harvey guillen from what we do in the shadows also on the scent of the map is one of the areas toughest crime families the three bears voiced by ray winstone olivia colman and samson kayo with their adopted daughter goldilocks voiced by florence pugh and jack has assembled his goon squad the bakers dozen go get his map back puss also has to worry about someone whos chasing him the big bad wolf voiced by wagner moura pablo escobar from narcos whos both a bounty hunter and the embodiment of death  theres a tactile roughness to the computer animation thats surprisingly energizing as if the filmmakers decided the action was moving too fast to render too many details the look matches the pacing which is usually as fast as puss swordplay and his verbal quips puss defiant catchphrase fear me if you dare will never cease being funny to me puss in boots the last wish is one of those splitlevel animated movie that serves up a fun story for the kids and jokes that will sail over the childrens heads and land with the grownups that approach doesnt always work on both levels but when it delights the way this one does its pretty special

Jan 15 2023,positive, whereas most remakes hold some reverence for what came before the newest house party movie just lets its fun flag fly it takes a pretty novel concept house party but at lebron james house and executes it without too much unnecessary selfseriousness and a bevy of smart stunt castings some of the jokes here are mercilessly funny including one nfl star cameo that has to be one of the best gags in a studio comedy in eons its a shame that this one isnt getting the best reception if only because its yet another studio comedy that does exactly what you need it to do what is the bar we are rating these movies with do they all have to be sophisticated enough to appeal to the most demanding audiences every now and again its just nice to get a soundly written genuinely funny admirably silly comedy that doesnt ask too too much from its viewer this is the first movie ive ever seen where the main character is based on someone whose office recaps i used to read pretty regularly its about what youd expect michael showalter is competent enough to make the reallife drama sink in and the cast is good enough to sell it i cant say all of the stylistic choices worked and the first act takes some time to really take root but yknow only a jackass could watch the third act and not feel something a pretty study february chiller with snow everywhere and henry melling doing his best foghorn leghorn impression im not sure why christian bale did this movie since his role doesnt really ask much of him but if scott cooper is his boy then you be there for your boy im a sucker for showbiz docs and i quite liked this one because i think its the best thing weve gotten in a long time that actually deals with the vfx revolution this would make a hell of a narrative feature but theyd never be able to get disney ilm or lucasfilm to sign off on anything that this doc deals with understandably steve williams was a genius but damn it sucks to watch a guy realize later in life that he pissed away his success trying to stick it to the man that really wasnt yknow all that bad dennis muren kind of takes one on the chin here and i think it wouldve been valuable for him to try to explain his side of the story however its easy to see that it takes a silent village to make these movies and that the folks winning the oscars always have people behind them making this all work thats true of all jobs on a movie set but a good reminder all the same the puss in boots movies are much better than the last two shrek films which were kind of dumb and greedy the spiderverse animation style is certainly a diversion from the classic dreamworks format even though i thought the bad guys used it to better effect puss reckoning with his mortality is much more engaging than the wishing star mcguffin but its all pretty fun and emotionally surprising were probably past due for another shrek movie and this was a good reminder that there is more to do there now that dreamworks seems like its actually trying again with the golden goose quite enjoyed this i wasnt crazy about the stage show but this was electric revolting children is one of the best scenes of the year fullstop emma thompson is a hell of a trunchbull and alisha weir and lashana lynch are perfect for the material this is just a thoroughly good stagetoscreen feels like its going to find its audience and stick around for a while better than the 90s one clearly ridiculous but damn it we didnt know what we had this was a blast and startlingly emotional by the end the aerosmith song is still a bop its the affable hangout movie that i kind of expected it to be with a delightful george clinton cameo a great robin harris performance and one of the most ohoh dear dated comedy bits of the early 90s kid n play could spit though i still dont know if this is quite the dadaist masterpiece people make it out to be whereas a movie like hot rod accomplishes the purposeful absurdism with a lot more consistency id love to have seen the warner bros executive who lost his everlasting mind after sitting down and watching millions and millions of dollars shoveled into a furnace for the vince vaughn christmas comedy they were assured would be a laugh fest for the whole family what a weird ass movie its not really for kids its not really for adults its not really for anyone who enjoys christmas its a movie that your newly divorced uncle goes to see by himself because vaughn was in wedding crashers and he heard someone at work say they liked it but they were actually thinking of elf its just got this salty underbelly that doesnt mesh with the festive nature of it and fred claus is not an interesting character vaughn doesnt ever seem like he wants to be there nobody does except for paul giamatti who is wasted as santa why did we waste paul giamatti as santa grumpy oh to have been a senior citizen at the height of the grumpy old men films what dreams may come this was good very nice walter matthau was the alltime grump they dont make em like they used to grumpier burgess meredith lives his damn life in this one its not quite as efficient as the first but its much better than whatever the hell those reviews were in 1995 those movie critics had no damn idea what was coming in the streaming age my fellow james garner reportedly described peter segal as a self appointed genius who didnt know his ass from second base and jack and i both knew it so ill let him speak for the movie
Jan 13 2023,positive, a sequel to a spinoff of a sequel to a storybook mashupthats puss in boots the last wish even though the tricks of the shrek franchise arent new this latest installment still has a lot to offer fans of the crackedfairytale genre the swashbuckling puss in boots voiced again by the incomparable antonio banderas finds hes buckled with a little too much swash fairytale cats might have nine lives but puss wasted his first eight in a series of ridiculous misadventures now afraid of losing his last life the once dashing feline has become a shadow of his former self with help from his sometimerivalsometimeloveinterest kitty softpaws salma hayek and a new doggie friend perrito harvey guillén puss goes in search of a wishing star that can restore his lost lives but a couple of criminal gangs are also after the last wishgoldies florence pugh bear family and jack horners bakers dozen despite being marketed as a family movie puss in boots the last wish isnt for everyone many younger children wont care for the scary scenes in which a wolflike grim reaper pursues puss and some of the characters die in comically gruesome ways the film also pushes the boundary of its pg rating with some unfinished expletives and a bleepedout tirade but folks who appreciate the shrek franchises offbeat humor will enjoy puss in boots the last wish the animation is smooth beautiful and actionpacked the excellent visuals complement a witty script with a virtuous message puss and his friends learn the power of sacrificial love and many characters in the movie become convicted of their selfishness learning to be content with what they already have collin is worlds arts and culture editor he is a graduate of the world journalism institute the southern baptist theological seminary and louisiana state university and resides with his wife and four children in sugar land texas
Jan 11 2023,positive, its 18 years since antonio banderas dashing animated puss in boots first appeared on our screens in shrek 2  which is 88 cat years after such a span one might not expect the fabulous feline to come crashing onto the screen with quite the panache he exhibits here  but then again cats are said to have nine lives the problem for puss as he discovers after his latest bit of derringdo lands him in the mortuary is that eight of his have already been used up the opening is overdone wonder woman 1984style but is swiftly followed by a magnificently entertaining scene in which we find out what happened to those other eight lives setting the bar for the rest of the film the only thing for puss to do now the doctor advises is go into retirement and try to eke out that last life for as long as he can the character being inspired by the mariachi films in which banderas first made his name there is ample precedent for this and before long he has buried his iconic costume grown a long white beard and furrowed his brow in a permanent expression of gloom in keeping with that tradition puss soon discovers that retirement isnt easy there are some dangerous people still on his trail hiding out with a cat lady he acquires a perky unreasonably loyal companion in the form of perrito harvey guillén a small dog who has disguised himself as a cat to get free food but its not long before his is discovered by his sometime true love sometime arch enemy kitty softpaws salma hayek and the three of them set out in search of a fallen star which puss hopes to use to restore his lives of course nothing is straightforward notorious crime gang goldilocks and the three bears florence pugh ray winstone olivia coleman and samson kayo are also after the star at the behest of scheming villain and pie magnate big jack horner john mulaney whilst puss is being stalked by death himself a big scary wolf voiced by wagner moura whats more kitty is bitter and puss full of guilt about something that happened in their shared past and perrito has no idea what hes supposed to be doing though we quickly get the impression that life has always been like that for him where earlier shrek spinoffs depended heavily on retrodden fairy tales and became more and more selfreferential haemorrhaging energy this one is a real return to form a fully developed story in its own right there are no plot points which newcomers to the franchise will be unable to grasp and although its too long for really young children to sit through in one go theres humour suitable for all age groups entertaining use is made of the idea of feline reincarnation theres a moment when puss is trapped in a cave with his past lives and it all goes a bit doctor who both he and kitty need to get past their egos to rediscover their romance and the chemistry sizzles between banderas and hayek as always goldilocks has a lesson to learn about family pugh clearly relishes a much more aggressive role than shes had access to before and little perrito has to develop a sense of self worth in the meantime theres lots of adventure with daring heists kidnaps and rescues high speed chases and dangerous stunts  all made more nerveracking by the knowledge that puss is on his last life by far the strongest entry in puss solo film career this doesnt do much to innovate with the quest framework and it could stand to lose ten minutes in the midsection such are the woes of middle age but it knows its audience and plays its hand well the selfconsciousness of earlier entries is gone theres a sense that the creators know they cant spin out the franchise forever and that they have realised at this late hour that what matters is to have fun with what remains

Dec 31 2022,positive, directed by joel crawford and januel mercado written by paul fisher tommy swerdlow and tom wheeler runtime 100 minutes mpa rating rated pg for actionviolence rude humorlanguage and some scary moments it only took 11 years but a new solo installment for the fearless swashbuckling feline hero puss in boots has finally arrived with puss in boots the last wish despite initial skepticism due to the decently average original puss in boots movie its obvious that filmmakers joel crawford and januel mercado overcame the shortcomings of the first film and delivered a rousing yet heartwarming animated adventure that lights a greatly needed fire underneath this shrek spinoff the initial puss in boots film was fairly successful but the character never truly felt like one deserving of a solo animated adventure until now a solo puss in boots movie was first discussed when the character appeared in a breakout role in shrek 2 in shrek 2 the joke was that puss does not exactly live up to his reputation he was certainly not a legitimate threat to shrek and donkey but he soon befriends the heroes and becomes a benevolent cohort to their ragtag band at the same time the character never felt strong enough to carry his own story the last wish puts puss banderas at a dire crossroads after living a frivolous freewheeling devilmaycare life of a swashbuckling outlawroguevigilante the fearless feline now faces the last of his nine lives puss must now contend with the fear of death which terrifies him to his core puss is stalked by a deadly bounty hunter the big bad wolf moura so his fight or flight instincts kick in and he seeks retirement in the refuge of cat lover mama luna randolph  puss begrudgingly accepts his new mundane existence and perhaps finds an answer to his troubles in the form of a magical wishing star evading the pursuit of the goldilocks pugh and the three bears crime family puss sets out on a new adventure to find the wishing star to get more lives back he unwittingly finds a new sidekick in the form of a stray aspiring unnamed therapy dog guillén and hes thrust back together with his old flame kitty softpaws hayek who is also searching for the wishing star however they arent the only ones searching for the stars magic goldilocks wants that magical wish as does the nefarious jack horner who wants to use the wishing star to gain control of all the magic in the world puss must now come to grips with what could be his last adventure the last wish finds its groove and delivers a strong yet emotional story for the fearless feline as puss faces his mortality and fear of death in a gripping conflict he is stripped down and hits rock bottom before he recovers the introduction of the big bad wolf who may or may not be the grim reaper is a constant visceral presence throughout the film the big bad wolfs visual design is impressive chilling and terrifying he makes for a striking silhouette and a worthy adversary that puss must eventually find the courage to face  banderas stretches his vocal acting muscles a bit more in the last wish his performance as puss in the sequel is less onenote and more vibrant and he performs a complex moral dilemma for puss puss must overcome his narcissism and come to grips with his mortality at some point even his legend must come to an end puss is never more alive than when he constantly stares death in the face but now that he is down to his last life he cant let go at the same time puss is miserable living in selfimposed exile the film depicts pusss vulnerability as an aging hero who is nearing the end of his story adding an appealing layer of drama to his character arc while the animation budget for the last wish looks limited compared to other bigbudget cganimated productions crawford and mercado work around that opting for a more heavily stylized look considering the story is framed as a fairytale the more painted edges of the animation and the new visual style lend a more whimsical storybook quality to the film when the action ramps up it moves at a lower framerate and the cg models almost seem to be moving in stop motion these moments happen are sparse when the stakes are at their highest and the effect does not feel too overused  the last wish introduces updates for familiar roles that fit like a glove in this wacky world of fractured fairytale characters mulaney is great as the storys key antagonist jack horner hes reimagined here as a gargantuan spoiled rich kid heir to his familys baked goods empire who has taken to collecting various magical antiquities and items other new standouts are goldilocks and three bears who are reimagined as a cockney crime family of british gangsters with pughs goldilocks as the ringleader  despite introducing all the new characters the writers maintain all of them rather well each party goes on their own unique journeys through the dark forest in pursuit of the magical wishing star goldilocks and the three bears also receive a rewarding emotional character arc that supplements puss journey  puss in boots the last wish is one of the years most surprising exceptional satisfying and emotional cinematic experiences it overcomes the odds and delivers a much more wellrounded rousing adventure for puss the only drawback is that dreamworks animation might have waited too long to deliver such a sequel for the favorite fearless hero puss in boots copyright  2024 411maniacom llc all rights reservedclick here for our privacy policy please help us serve you better fill out our

Dec 30 2022,positive, one remark that helped ensure former disney chief executive officer bob chapeks stint at the top was short was his casual observation that animation was for children while tots do love cartoons chapek seems to have forgotten that for every childs ticket sold a parent has to buy another one as a result even the most childfriendly entertainment is often loaded with jokes kids might not get until they reach a certain age for example the new dreamworks offering puss in boots the last wish has more dynamic and interesting characters than most live action films have screenwriters tommy swerdlow and paul fisher make the fearless feline more engaging by taking something away from him in the shrek movies and in his own films puss in boots antonio banderas thwarts larger foes by mere audacity hes not very big but his cat reflexes enable him to survive duels that would kill larger creatures as the last wish begins however hes in for a rude awakening it turns out his endurance is due to the fact that he had nine lives but stupid accidents have now squandered eight of them he briefly lets himself go to seed with crazy cat lady mama luna davine joy randolph but ends up reluctantly befriending an overly friendly dog named perro harvey guillen while he may now be mortal and now lacks a proper fencing foil puss in boots is too proud to simply remain in seclusion in the dark forest there is a wishing star that can grant a single longing for whomever finds it getting his lives back is already a powerful draw but he has to compete with goldilocks florence pugh and the three bears ray winstone samson kayo and olivia colman and the monstrous jack horner john mulaney who isnt little or good anymore did i mention that the big bad wolf wagner moura and his former lover kitty southpaws salma hayek are also trailing puss and the mysterious star as banderas wrestles with a cartoon cats ego and mortality he finds new opportunities to hone his craft that havent existed when hes on camera its not hyperbole to say that academics could write worthwhile essays on the cats struggle its also rewarding to hear banderas both woo and spar with hayek the two have a spirited rapport that makes their lovehate relationship consistently involving while kids will get their share of delightful eye candy adults can giggle at all the clever nods to sergio leones italian westerns and to other fairy tales one of the reasons that jack horner is so tyrannical is that hes mad that he has only a nursery rhyme when puss in boots has his own fairy tale im not sure why director joel crawford the croods a new age decided that all the confrontations should be staged animestyle but he and his collaborators exceed their quota of delights for a film that runs barely over 90 minutes material from the associated press is copyright  2024 associated press and may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed associated press text photo graphic audio andor video material shall not be published broadcast rewritten for broadcast or publication or redistributed directly or indirectly in any medium neither these ap materials nor any portion thereof may be stored in a computer except for personal and noncommercial use the ap will not be held liable for any delays inaccuracies errors or omissions therefrom or in the transmission or delivery of all or any part thereof or for any damages arising from any of the foregoing all rights reserved
Dec 30 2022,positive, despite efforts to diminish its value the medium of animation has turned out some stellar films this year and it only seems fitting that one of the best closes out this year with puss in boots the last wish as its title would suggest the last wish finds antonio banderas titular feline at the edge of his rope years of dangerous exploits have taken their toll on puss and hes down to the last of his nine lives after resigning himself to living out the rest of his days as a pampered feline puss soon learns about a fallen star that grants wishes determined to regain his lives as well as his legend puss chases after the star but he isnt the only one seeking its powers there are a number of figures who want the stars power from goldilocks florence pugh and her three bears to the malevolent jack horner john mulaney throw in perro harvey guillen a lovable but dimwitted dog and his former flame kitty softpaws salma hayek and puss has his work cut out for him his journey will take him through a magical forest and bring him facetoface with his own mortality in the process dreamworks has constantly turned out amazing animated adventures over the years whether they involve dragons ogres or trollhunters the last wish is no different its opening sequence features puss throwing a party in a corrupt governors house that descends into a fight with a massive stone giant thats just a taste of things to come in the same fashion as the shrek franchise that it spun off from the last wish features twisted takes on fairy tales horner isnt as little as the nursery rhyme that describes him having gathered immense girth over the years goldilocks and the bears are mercenaries and there are plenty of jabs at other fairy tales including a brilliant running gag that has to be seen to be believed but in true dreamworks fashion theres a deeper message puss has lived his lifeor rather livesrecklessly pursuing adventure and fame above all else after all if you had nine lives wouldnt you live them to the fullest however once he learns that hes literally living on borrowed time theres a marked change in his demeanor he lets himself go growing a beard full of whiskers and burying his boots and hat and he constantly pushes away perros attempts to befriend him in short we are dealing with an animated movie that shows an anthropomorphic cat having a midlife crisis and i love it the last wish also boasts a stellar voice cast especially where banderas is concerned banderas has the chance to portray multiple versions of puss the swashbuckling hero the man dealing with his own mortality and the person struggling with an inability to form connections its the most layered performance hes delivered as the feline swordsman and its the center around which the movie revolves the rest of the cast also gets their moment in the spotlight pugh is a scene stealer as goldilocks and guillen is extremely charming as perro seriously i dare you to walk away and not fall in love with that little dog and the animation definitely deserves to be talked about much like the bad guys the last wish has a mix of 2d and 3d animation which results in some of the most creative fight sequences ever put to the screen whenever puss hits someone or uses his sword impact lines spiral outwards and a montage of his past lives weaves numbers into the background in some surprisingly creative fashion theres even a haunting sequence where a lupine hunter wagner moura pursues puss through a crystalline cave as the wolf closes in on puss the walls grow as red as his eyes leading to a haunting effect its just another example of how a certain film about a certain webslinger continues to influence animation and i hope it never stops puss in boots the last wish delivers a swashbuckling adventure that boasts some amazing animation as well as a solid message about embracing life in all its forms its the perfect cap to the year and it continues to prove that animation is a medium that can thrive when people give it a chance lets hope this isnt the last chapter of puss in boots adventures puss in boots the last wish delivers a swashbuckling adventure that

Dec 30 2022,positive, i saw three great animated films this year guillermo del toros pinocchio marcel the shell with shoes on and the holiday release puss in boots the last wish i loved the feline character when he first stole the second shrek movie back in 2004 but whod have thought after numerous iterations from films to tv specials including pusss own standalone film puss in boots in 2011 that this longdowntheroad sequel would be so splendid making it all the niftier in many ways it echoes much of what was done by antonio banderas pusss voice in pedro almodovars pain  glory in 2020 both that film and this one concern an aging protagonist reflecting upon his past while trying to reckon with his limited future how cheeky is that even cheekier puss isnt just looking back on one life but eight of em cats have nine lives of course and thats the jokey premise at the center of this sequel and devilmaycare puss has lived such a life of adventure and antics his carelessness has cost him an octuple of mortality now hes got one life left and hes feeling the need to slow down and take it easy especially when death starts hounding him in the image of well a hound death voiced by wagner moura has red eyes and wields circular blades like hes a ninja of death and hes quite scary thus puss isnt just worried about what pitfalls may lie ahead of him but hes continually looking over his shoulder too that becomes even more of a problem for puss when hes pulled back into the world of derringdo when hes forced to fend off goldilocks florence pugh and her three bear crime family of bounty hunters olivia colman ray winstone and samson kayo out to get him the quartet is also after a special map that promises a wishing star to be found in a magical forest promising immortality  puss realizes thats just the ticket he needs so he joins forces with a cute and worshipful dog named perrito harvey guillen and his exflame kitty softpaws salma hayek to find the star first of course as everyone from tom wolfe to marty mcfly discovered you cant really go home again and the more adventures pusss trio discovers as they follow the map into a secret forest a treacherous mountain or an icy glade the more puss realizes he cannot go back to being the cavalier cat he used to be hes now seasoned a mature old salt whos forced to mentor the youthful perrito not to mention own up to the damage he caused in his past romance with kitty a lot of this is played for pathos pulling at our heartstrings and affection for the adorable puss but a lot of it is utterly hilarious too as puss battles his age his fears his foes and crazy obstacles in the forest amongst his new enemies is little jack horner john mulaney a chubby villain who could give brendan frasers the whale a run for his money jacks after the map too it all makes for a crackerjack adventure albeit one that is also a mature story about regret and loneliness as all the characters here are lost souls looking for love each of the slate of characters is brought vocally to life by the game cast particularly banderas pugh and mulaney the animation and production design are impressive too taking a page from the look of the spiderman into the spiderverse film and its mix of cartoon styles montages and jump cuts director joel crawford working from a script by paul fisher and tommy swedlow and a story by swedlow and tom wheeler finds the perfect balance between escapade and character development colman and winstone arent slumming here theyre parts get bigger as the show goes on the production design is lovely throughout and the pop culture references are sprinkled in throughout without becoming groaners or too obvious and banderas dots his performance with genuine sadness and aching maturity  cleverly echoing what he did in pain  glory  perhaps that film and this one would make for a unique double bill someday ultimately the exploration of pusss pain and glory remorse the cat made this more than just a sharp and lovely cartoon film it made it one of the years best films one to be treasured by any age
Dec 29 2022,positive,this year there have not been many top quality animated films unlike 2021 when there were more excellent animated films this movie is one the top five best animated films of 2022 and it should get an academy award nomination
Dec 29 2022,positive, if youre looking to escape the summer heat by heading into a movie theatre  or if you just want to veg out at home with some christmas ham and a flick  theres plenty of new release movies that are worth your time whether youre into daniel craig as a welldressed detective or a frizzyhaired greta gerwig with a child on her hip looking for something joyful to watch with the kids or with your friend who cant stop quoting the trip theres something on the plate thats just for you our critic luke goodsell says who can resist a 9foot 300pound computergenerated crocodile with sad eyes a natty scarf and the mellifluous pipes of shawn mendes not constance wu crazy rich asians whose extremely flirtatious songanddance duet with the titular lizard nearly tips this amiable kids movie into the realm of something truly outré she even draws him like one of her french girls and can you blame her hes kinda hot fun tunes from the greatest showman songwriting team and a typically irrepressible turn from bardem as a flamboyant impresario give this take on the 1965 picture book some pizzazz but the rest is mostly mild postpaddington kindness schtick  with the obligatory elton john singalong noteworthy because its the prince of mumblecores take on a postmodern classic by don delillo starring adam driver as a professor of hitler studies and baumbachs partner gerwig as his pillpopping wife thats sad lit girlguy bingo our reviewer michael sun says for the majority of its run time baumbachs work hews too closely to its source material the result is a film that feels both stuffy and overstuffed lending credence to the longheld belief in white noises unadaptability  to his credit baumbach films the supposedly unfilmable with great gusto  which at least initially sustains a winning union between author and adaptor this service may include material from agence francepresse afp aptn reuters aap cnn and the bbc world service which is copyright and cannot be reproduced
Dec 27 2022,positive, please bear with me while i reveal my callow youth i grew up with the original shrek i was in middle school when it was released in 2001 and im old enough to have neck pain and heartburn now that puss in boots the last wish is out life is funny but not as amusing as this latest offering from dreamworks puss in boots the last wish is so much more than a spinoff from shrek this is a story that stands on its own four paws and offers more than one would expect from a narrative that originated in 2004 in april dreamworks released the bad guys which i had a blast with and while i should appreciate an original story more than a spinoff sequel i cant help but admit the last wish is still two steps ahead of the animated heist flick the story starts off with puss antonio banderas throwing a huge party in san ricardo full of drinks music and dancing it immediately establishes the egotistical thief whose noise drives a nearby giant to attack with bountiful action and a fresh animated style that updates the story for 2022 puss leaps into action taking out the giant and unexpectedly dying in the process afterward puss wakes up on the table of a town doctor and discovers he has used up eight of his nine lives the doctor informs our hero that he needs to retire but no puss in boots will shake this off like he has so many other challenges while drinking alone in a bar puss is greeted by a bountyhunting wolf wagner moura who intends to kill the feline once and for all the little swordsman tries to fight off the wolf but is easily rebuffed and sensing his impending doom the cat scurries off leaving his sword behind i cannot express how chilling the wolf is as a villain and i dont want to spoil his true identity but the setup the performance of moura and the deviously dark way hes never far away from puss all combine to make the best antagonist since fairy godmother burying his trademark cape boots and hat puss retires and moves in with an elderly cat lady named mama luna davine joy randolph and a house full of voiceless felines with every last shred of dignity taken from him puss assumes his new identity as pickles and lives as a typical cat growing a depression beard and losing all track of time as days go by goldilocks florence pugh and the three bears break in having tracked puss to the house they trash the place wanting to hire puss to steal a map for them to a magical wishing star but they dont recognize the downtrodden former hero and instead come upon his grave where he buried his clothes believing puss dead they head off to steal the map determined to take the map and claim that wish to restore his nine lives puss sets off with a little dog named perrito harvey guillen to claim the treasure along the way they run into puss former love interest kitty softpaws salma hayek the cats and dog begrudgingly find themselves all on a team to locate this fallen star and claim the wish but hot on their trail are goldilocks her bears and a villain named jack horner john mulaney armed with a bag of magical weapons the film keeps a fast pace never allowing the story to become tedious or dull and yet it finds reflective moments to develop each character the last wish even manages to deliver a surprisingly tactful display of mental health concerns puss repeatedly faces his mortality and finds his hair rising and his heart racing beyond control leaving him physically exasperated and trapped in a panic attack thankfully therapydogintraining perrito is there to show everyone exactly what service these extraordinary animals provide to their patients to my shock perrito ends up being one of the best parts of the film and this little dog who could have easily been relegated to an annoying comedic relief role instead becomes the soul of this movie its all thanks to smart writing and a purehearted performance from guillen who has plenty of experience serving as the manager of morale and compassion in a show i love what we do in the shadows the narrative offers plenty of riffs on fairy tales as shrek became well known for but the movie utilizes them in clever refreshing ways that shrek the third and shrek ever after wish they could have dreamworks knocks the animation out of the park for the last wish with a hyperstylized blend of beautiful textures and sketchy action scenes that feel lifted from a kineograph the colors are vibrant and a wide variety of magical settings allows each scene in the story to play out with strong authority i was wowed by the refreshing creativity of the dark forest in which the world changes entirely depending on who is holding the map that leads to the wishing star thats the kind of outofthebox thinking i love to see in fantasy films and the fact that its all woven together in an exciting multilayer chase stupendous puss in boots the last wish is an energetic film thats bolstered by a surprising amount of heart and clever writing what a fantastic way to end 2022 in film next week ill release my 10 favorite movies of the year and odds are pretty good this will make the list material from the associated press is copyright  2024 associated press and may

Dec 27 2022,positive, moviegoers shouldnt have to rely on a sequel to a shrek spinoff from 11 years ago to discover dazzling spectacle but here we are just days after avatar the way of water finessed and stretched the photoreal cg language of james camerons original to greater heights depths a frickin puss in boots movie swings the action pendulum in the complete opposite stylistic direction while remaining on camerons audacious wavelength puss in boots the last wish the latest dreamworks animation film steals mercilessly from the spiderman into the spiderverse playbook and you know what thank god for it  the result is a fairy tale adventure that complements genuine laughs with splashy impressionistic art  i have absolutely no memory of what happened in 2011s puss in boots nor the netflix show the adventures of puss in boots but am happy to report a lack of puss knowledge did not negatively impact my time watching an antonio banderasvoiced cat scurry around with his sword when we pick up with puss hes a milkdrunk legend realizing hes wasted eight of his nine lives wolf a physical manifestation of death who wields two scythes and is voiced by narcos wagner moura could not be happier  all he wants is to cut down the arrogant feline as he begs for mercy but when puss catches wind of a fallen star capable of granting a wish he sets off with kitty softpaws salma hayek and a tiny dog named perrito what we do in the shadows harvey guillén to seize the opportunity on his fluffy tail are goldilocks florence pugh and her three bears crime family and the shrekverses version of the collector big jack horner john mulaney who also want the star  talks of a puss in boots 2 began just after the first movies success executive producer guillermo del toro teased in 2012 that a script was already in the works and by 2014 banderas was making promises about the characters return  possibly alongside shrek none of this came to pass and dreamworks saw creativeteam shakeups eventually joel crawford the croods a new age stepped in to helm the movie with januel mercado as codirector with the mo of completely rethinking what a cganimated movie had to look like at dreamworks  when the shrek movies came out cg animation was in an interesting space last wish production designer nate wragg recently told animation magazine part of the spectacle of it was wow it looks so real even though its not look what the computer can do weve now been able to swing the pendulum back into a space where animation originated which was an artistic expression bambis backgrounds were watercolored it was beautiful but it didnt have to be photoreal as an animation fan this has been a long time coming spiderverses arrival in 2018 felt like a bulletspeed pebble lodging itself in the windshield of mainstream western animation the cracks were immediate and between dreamworks the bad guys netflixs arcane and pixars upcoming elemental the rules might be fully shattered puss in boots the last wish giving the crude shrek franchise a facelift in every imaginable way is a reason to hope the last wish is the closest ive ever seen a movie get to emulating handpainted concept art on their way to the wishing star puss and company traverse prismatic backdrops  from bright pinks and green forests to the rustic interiors of a catlady prison  that feel dabbed on by the artistic team their encounters with beasties use color linework and kinetic camera moves to bring viewers deeper into the battles and like the way of water regularly shift frame rates to jolt the senses puss looking more oilpainted than ever may be monologuing about his legendary skills one second animated on the ones then find himself in a cacophonous skirmish with a towering troll the next which the team animates on the twos the sensation builds on the work of spiderverse and drags the shrek franchise of all things into the territory of high art its stunning the movies also really funny having recently revisited shrek 1 and shrek 2 i cant say i walked into the last wish with an open heartfunny bone  pop culture hijinks and fairytale riffs were dusty then and petrified now the last wish team including credited screenwriters paul fisher and tommy swerdlow reinvent the humor just like the animation while the movie offers a few nostalgic nods to shrek with brief appearances by gingerbread man and pinocchio and jack horners endless supply of fantasy literature collectibles gives mulaney plenty of joke fuel the movies comedy stylings more closely resemble groundhog day banderas it turns out can do the bill murray mumblestoself oneliner thing a recurring bit finds puss reliving his past deaths and the versions of himself showman puss swole puss drunk puss that led to each demise in this sequel a somewhat obligatory poop joke is actually a litter box joke about puss faking his own death and burying his body good the last wish might just be the best thing dreamworks animation a studio that isnt as known for pushing the limits of the medium has produced in the last decade 2010 gave us the emotional thrillride of how to train your dragon and 2011 had kung fu panda 2 a martial arts odyssey bursting with imagination that asserted director jennifer yuh nelson as a toptier action director even if hollywood never made good on it maybe how to train your dragon 2 tops the original with bigger action  ill leave that to the hardcore fans the bad guys was definitely a step in the right technological direction earlier this year i will not be engaging with boss baby discourse whatever the case the achievement glimmers with hope dreamworks animation a studio that has bounced from various homes never found its footing against pixar and struggled in the shadow of the minions may have found a new mode if this level of artistry and cleverness is what the studio brings to future films hell i will get in line for shrek 5 there is so much animation can do and hollywood finally seems ready to grant its artists permission to do it
Dec 27 2022,positive, in 2005 a star took over a young franchise on the comeup while 2001s shrek won the firstever best animated feature oscar the arrival of puss in boots voiced by antonio banderas became a watershed moment for dreamworks rather than rest on the laurels of the first film their new character stole shrek 2 from its established stars he added his own brand of humor the beautiful singing of banderas and new storytelling possibilities it was no surprise when dreamworks spun him off into his own starring film in 2011 despite the success it took more than a decade for puss in boots the last wish to arrive in theaters however the long break helped the last wish establish itself as one of dreamworks best films  after an accident puss banderas discovers he is on the last of his nine lives puss goes into hiding where he meets a strange dog named perro harvey guillén when goldilocks florence pugh  the three bears ray winstone olivia colman and samson kayo recruit puss to steal a map leading to a wishing star puss takes matters into his own paws after stealing the map from big jack horner john mulaney puss partners up with kitty softpaws salma hayek and perro the three race to the wishing star with horner the goldilocks and a mysterious wolf on their tail wagner moura  crawford and mercado infuse these new visuals with blasts of color and absurd storytelling the pacing of the last wish quickly pushes audiences into the visual language of action films theres barely a moment of fat in the film with many of the slower scenes chewing through background and exposition to set up emotional payoffs nearly every aspect introduced throughout the film is paid off by the end the tight script combined with the new visuals allows puss in boots the last wish to take flight  the voice cast provides stellar work as well banderas and hayek bring back their witty banter which is as perfect as ever guillén provides muchneeded comedic highlights bringing the raw energy and naive nature of a dog to life pugh winstone colman and kayo steal long stretches of the film imbued with cockney accents and witty banter moura instantly becomes the most frightening in a shrek franchise film and earns a place in dreamworks hall of fame if theres a complaint about this voice cast it might be that moura is too scary for children  the new animation will bring in many new audiences but not for everyone admittedly it takes a minute or two to adjust to the spiderverse style which will benefit younger animation fans but may disorient more seasoned viewers combining multiple art styles will help dreamworks under universal regain its status as a powerhouse animation studio  one can already see this in action based on the themes of the last wish most notably those about mortality the animated feature has plenty of key moments that will make the kids laugh and puss journey will help deepen their emotional attachment for parents it may take on a more personal feeling and as such will keep their attention far more than other dreamworks films have in recent years this along with trolls world tour seem to indicate a pipeline of more complex stories for legacy characters it bodes extremely well for the studio that has begun facing competition from laika cartoon saloon and netflix  puss in boots the last wish never needed to be so creative or funny to capture audiences however the last wish stands a legitimate shot to be among dreamworks very best films brilliant and bold animation helps propel extenuate the pace of the caper adventure the surprisingly great cast also performs the heck out of their dialogue while the story will be predictable to many audience members theres enough here to celebrate the return of our favorite feline hero perhaps it bodes well for future entries from far far away 
Dec 27 2022,positive,a visual joy as brighthued animation brings the witty characters to life meanwhile the snappy dialog includes some underlying emotion to make the film entertaining for all ages even if it feels rather hyperactive
Dec 27 2022,positive,unlike some of the shrek sequels this film has a lot more life  a lot of good jokes mostly at the expense of puss and the weird characters and amazingly there is a third iteration of jiminy cricket in 2022 also notable for its eyepopping animation

Dec 26 2022,positive, after his latest derringdo puss in boots antonio banderas learns he has squandered eight of his nine lives and any swashbuckled misstep could spell curtains for the legendary outlaw convinced to hang up his cape and stow his beloved boots in exchange for an early retirement a chance to restore his lost lives launches puss on what could be his final adventure with an unwanted but trustworthy companion harvey guillén and his former romantic interest kitty softpaws salma hayek puss must reach his goal ahead of goldilocks florence pugh her three bears ray winstone olivia colman and samson kayo and a notso little jack horner john mulaney but his real fear is the big bad wolf wagner moura an experienced hunter by trade whose interest is more than a mere bounty since his first appearance in shrek 2 puss in boots has been in every following shrek adventure his own prequel movie a short film plus a television series one would think there had been another fulllength film since 2011 but considering shrek forever after was the last appearance of the fairy tale gang in 2010 a decade has passed sporting a new dreamworks logo and reminding audiences that the bad guys was a big hit earlier this year rumors of a fifth shrek film positions the last wish as a tasty appetizer codirectors joel crawford and januel mercado have all the latest animation tools at their disposal but is the interest still there for a fractured fairy tale cat on his last leg with an unmistakable nod to sergio leone and wallowing in spaghetti western tropes the last wish is surprisingly solid and perhaps the best entry in the shrek universe to date the hairraising offscreen whistling of the wolf moments before his appearance has its roots in any number of westerns most recently by the villain negan and his followers in the walking dead juggling an ensemble of characters and tapping into darker themes  including actual blood in a pg animated flick  even the animation ups the ante in a stylized way reminiscent of kung fu pandas edits juggling so many protagonists antagonists and subplots would be a chore for any directors but common themes coupled with a tight script and vivid characterizations make it look effortless banderas puss is the best of his career characters all magnified into a single wonderful entity and salma hayek remains his perfect foil as kitty heroes are only as good as their villains however and a trio of heavies herein are each their own treat florence pughs goldi appears like a cockneyaccented throwaway until her repartee with the three bears adds complexity and empathy mulaneys jack horner revels in his villainy giving jim carreys dr robotnik a run for his money harvey guilléns perro is a warm and fuzzy scenestealer but mouras wolf manages to upstage everyone casting a solemn shadow over the entire story as the perfect nemesis for puss with a brisk runtime and something for everyone the timing of the release for the last wish is no accident its only real competition in the animation award space is dreamworks adaptation the bad guys with sam rockwell as the big bad wolf unless theres an upset by either guillermo del toros fascistfighting pinocchio or a24s darling marcel the shell with shoes on with apologies to both disney and del toro the last wish arguably owns this years most tolerable pinocchio appearance especially coupled with kevin mccanns deadon jimmy stewartesque ethical bug counting our blessings thank the movie gods roberto benigni didnt release another pinocchio this year
Dec 26 2022,positive, or maybe its the cats meow however you want to put it the latest entry into the shrek series is the finest so far its dialogue is clawsharp its story line fresh and fun and the animation is glorious antonio banderas once again voices the heroic kitty whose tale begins with lots of action and humor puss has lost none of his bravado over the years  after all he has nine lives right but hold on there just how many lives has puss used up in his adventures he has only one left it turns out and death aka the big bad wolf wagner moura  kids might not recognize his voice from his role in narcos but grownups certainly might lurks nearby waiting for the chance to claim the previously fearless feline once and for all he figures he can stay safe if he discontinues his wild ways he becomes one of a number of felines in the care of a lady has dozens of cats in her home puss meets the goofy dog perrito harvey guillén who becomes a sort of sancho panza to puss although puss thinks he doesnt really need a sidekick puss also figures there may be another way out he needs to get his hands er paws on a wishing star that might grant him another life or two an old acquaintance kitty softpaws salma hayek appears shes also looking for the wishing star as is the notsolittle jack horner john mulaney to add to his challenges puss also must avoid a group of criminals familiar to shrek fans to have a successful garden you need to know when it is the best time to plant here are the best plants to start in may
Dec 25 2022,positive,rarely do i watch a film more than once and i can count on one hand the number of times ive watched a film more than 3 timespuss in boots the last wish is one of them
Dec 24 2022,neutral, the film allows puss in boots time to shine but far too many characters and a lack of heart prevent the last wish from reaching its full potential   everyones favorite animated cat returns in puss in boots the last wish with a new adventure and an inspiring animation style the sequel  directed by joel crawford and januel mercado from a screenplay by paul fisher and tommy swerdlow  is more superior to and has more depth than its predecessor it allows puss in boots who was first introduced in shrek 2 time to shine and assess his inner life but far too many characters and a lack of heart prevent puss in boots the last wish from reaching its full potential   puss in boots antonio banderas is in a bit of a bind having been on so many adventures and fought bravely in exciting battles puss in boots is down to the last of his nine lives hes also being hunted by the big bad wolf wagner moura in a twist on the classic tale the character is usually in terrified of death puss in boots joins forces with old flame kitty softpaws salma hayek and perro harvey guillén to find the last wish to reclaim his nine lives the only issue is that he must beat goldilocks florence pugh and the three bears  olivia colman as mama bear ray winstons as papa bear and samson kayo as baby bear  and the villainous jack horner john mulaney to get to it before they do   puss in boots the last wish has bouts of humor and when it happens the film can be deeply funny the animation style is also spectacular  one of the years best the last wish changing its animation style from the first puss in boots was a good decision the sequels animation is clearly influenced by spiderman into the spiderverse and anime to bring its visual palette to life to that end the animation style is made more intriguing and unique bringing together 2d and 3d animation instead of sticking to one style it adds richness to the animation and the world it creates   the films themes are wonderful as puss in boots grapples with his mortality and what to do with the one life he has left though the film retcons certain aspects of his character its to the benefit of the story with puss in boots coming to the realization that he doesnt have to face everything on his own nor does he have to be alone when there are those who care about him puss can be very selfish here and he is driven by fear and the need to run away so its a nice lesson that he learns as he lets kitty softpaws and perro in despite his reluctance to do so initially   where the last wish falters is in its lack of heart too focused on the thrill of the adventure there is little time spent on properly developing the supporting characters which leaves the films final moments rather devoid of the feeling it was likely aiming for there are also too many characters vying for attention taking away from the main character and his journey the animation includes a plethora of fairy tale stories in one and the result is bloated and messy with far too many unnecessary subplots  like that of goldilocks and the three bears personal journey  that ultimately dont add much and are underwhelming whats more the last wishs antagonist is frustrating and unneeded in a film where puss mortality and a persistent terrifying bounty hunter already serve this purpose   puss in boots the last wish will surely entertain younger audiences the animation is beautiful the script occasionally funny and there is plenty of adventure to excite audiences for the adults however the last wish leaves a lot to be desired with underbaked supporting characters and a bloated story that while sometimes entertaining isnt entirely heartwarming or memorable the animated sequel could have been a lot more than average   puss in boots the last wish released in theaters december 21 the film is 100 minutes long and rated pg for actionviolence rude humorlanguage and some scary moments  mae is a writer and editor she previously wrote about a variety of entertainment for inverse cinemablend pajiba and the young folks she has also been a juror for various film festivals she enjoys discussing all things entertainment but loves to dance read and paint when shes not busy watching movies and tv shows the lego group has released five new star wars sets for march 1st celebrating the toy companys 25th anniversary with the galaxy far far away while tom hardy was a front runner for bond 26s new 007 one forgotten flop proves the actor isnt right for the role of james bond after all the matrix is rightly considered one of the most influential scifi action movies of all time but some aspects of the film havent held up

Dec 23 2022,positive, its been over a decade since shrek 2 debuted in 2004 and introduced us to a new snarkier version of a fairy tale character we all know and love puss in boots the fierce feline played throughout the shrek franchise by antonio banderas has returned for his first solo film in 11 years puss in boots the last wish could have easily been a disappointing cash grab working on nostalgia for characters who have become iconic to a certain generation of moviegoers thankfully the movie gives us a nice surprise a sequel with plenty of humor and heart for new and old friends of puss alike  at the beginning of the film we find our furry hero puss thriving in his life as an outlaw and adventurer hes untouchable until he realizes after a close encounter with a giant that hes down to the last of his nine lives after initially trying to brush off this new information puss runs into a bounty hunter who might actually be death incarnate wagner moura their encounter is genuinely terrifying and so puss goes into a full existential crisis so he decides to retire from adventuring and become a fulltime housecat landing him in the care of mama luna davine joy randolph a de facto crazy cat lady who takes in cats with nowhere else to go there he meets perrito harvey guillén an unwanted chihuahua whos eeking by at mama lunas in a cat costume the pair strike up a reluctant friendship and all seems tame until a crime family made up of goldilocks and the three bears crashes in looking to catch a bounty for puss and revealing the location of a wishing star in the dark forest inspired to try and get his 8 lives back through the wishing star puss and perrito set out on a new adventure the last wish is better than it has any right to be from charming animation that combines digital and analog sensibilities and takes cues from fairytale books to performances that are pitchperfect it works it would be a mistake to write it off as a lateinthegame sequel or nostalgia cashgrab when its clear theres true craftsmanship behind the work banderas is welcome in a return performance that is fun and sweet as is salma hayek playing kitty softpaws but the new cast shines as well guillén brings real heart to the movie with his take on perrito an outcast who manages to see the bright side of life and aspires to be a therapy dog one day goldilocks and the three bears crime family played by florence pugh olivia coleman ray winstone and samson kayo are a funny and warm addition to the film even if theyre some of the villains puss is trying to outrun similarly john mulaney enters his villain era as big jack horner the true big bad of the film who is irredeemably and hilariously evil and has fun with it to the benefit of the film the magic combo of this cast helps the humor and heart land with pleasant ease with a lot of options for what to watch over the upcoming holidays you could do worse than puss in boots the last wish come for the return of a familiar feline friend and stay for a surprisingly fun and wholesome time 
Dec 23 2022,positive,not as good as its immediate processor but enjoyable enough
Dec 23 2022,positive, is it any wonder anymore that kids films often include more mature themes that resonate with parents not really pixar has set the standard for years and others have followed the money still its noteworthy how puss in boots the last wish is all about coming to terms with the fact that your life must eventually end seeing how this franchise owes its existence to making fun of our most beloved fairytale traditions more than ten years after his last feature puss is back and still voiced by antonio banderas who sounds like hes having way too much fun playing a character hes brought to animated life for nearly 20 years puss has brought the fiesta as usual sticking his whiskers in a local governors digs and fighting a sleeping giant he happened to bring to life in the process the adventure goes awry when puss dies and hes forced to realize that years of careless heroics have left him with one life left and death wagner moura is licking his chops in anticipation of claiming him for his own but puss sees a chance to reclaim the legend hes built his life on by finding the mythical wishing star  along for the quest is an adorable comicrelief dog perrito harvey guillén pusss old frenemy kitty softpaws salma hayek new obstacles in goldi florence pugh and the three bears crime family and the irredeemable jack horner john mulaney whos looking to steal the worlds magic for himself pick your fairy tale and youll find a reference with astonishingly fun creative action sequences in an animation style that owes more to anime than cgi if things are resolved a bit too quickly and predictably the sheer charm of the journey and the stellar voice cast make it nearly unnoticeable pg 100 min

Dec 23 2022,positive,this is an entertaining movie that asks a question all viewers might pause to think about if you had just one wish what would it be and who would it be for yourself or someone else

Dec 23 2022,positive, eleven years since his first solo adventure puss in boots is finally back and quick to introduce his audience to a new fairytale joel crawfords and januel mercados puss in boots the last wish finds the zorroinspired feline seeking the last wish granted by a wishing star that fell from the sky coming face to face with death and realizing that this is one opponent he may not be able to defeat he believes this wish will save his life its not the only animated film this year to touch on themes of mortality but its especially interesting to explore when centered around a character who attempts to appear so fearless puss in boots the last wish is an endlessly entertaining and colorful actionadventure neowestern about a desperado attempting to understand what living truly means puss in boots antonio banderas is above all an entertainer with wild westinspired cues in heitor pereiras score the films spaghetti western nods create a tone matching the suave quickdrawing lead puss is wanted dead or alive but that doesnt stop his outlaw antics even when his carelessness wakes a destructive giant his bravado earns him praise  a tip of his cavaliers hat and a swoosh of his blade is all he needs to do for applause singing of being a fearless hero he treats fights like a song and dance eventually though he misses a beat and finds eight of his nine lives spent hes laughed in the face of death wagner moura before and has never been touched by a blade but puss finds that this is the most skilled and terrifying opponent hes ever faced  his swashbuckling days seem to have come to an end as he checks himself into mama luna davine joy randolphs cat rescue domestication as a housecat doesnt suit him no matter how hard he tries to fit in but puss seems to accept his new role as a geriatric bag of bones as one character puts it however his cape belt and hat come back on quickly as he learns of a map leading to the wishing star becoming determined to get his nine lives back  banderas excels at bringing puss to life again with exuberance theres a real fervor in his voice performance that captures vulnerability in the often macho character hes incredibly skilled at capturing the felines bravado but also the true fear he experiences on this adventure banderas once again brings some real humor to the film as well successfully embodying a character written to be so dynamic and colorful to match the films gorgeous animation the animation fully commits to embodying the characters style and spunk especially with its thrilling fight scenes that emphasize every quick movement and clash of blades the stunning and grand production design and everchanging environments match his big personality and unpredictability nature  on the way to getting his wish many characters are hot on pusss tail with the same idea theres the cockney crime family of goldilocks florence pugh and the three bears ray winstone olivia colman and samson kayo big jack horner john mulaney whos turned his love of pies into a successful business pusss old flame kitty softpaws salma hayek pinault now in the role of rival cat thief dog sidekick perro harvey guillén who is an annoyance at first to both puss and the audience but grows on both as he teaches the characters many lessons along this journey theres also a jiminy crickettype character voiced by kevin mccann doing an uncanny jimmy stewart impression the film provides a dose of magic when exploring fairytale and nursery rhythm characters in new even dark ways its also a treat to be able to pick out the references in both the dialogue and easter eggs onscreen  death proves to be a fascinating opponent creating a viewing experience thats both fulfilling and unpredictable whats also fulfilling  and in the end heartwarming  are the lessons that the characters are presented with in our current hustle culture consumerdriven society we like puss in boots are always looking for the next thing to keep us busy or the hottest new toy to get our hands on as a result we forget to stop and appreciate what we have and forget that life is more than those things perro is able to stop and smells the roses something that puss has never done before he has taken life by the sword its been a life full of adventure and admiration sure but a life thats been lonely too love and friendship turn out to be the biggest discovery on this quest for pusss wishing star but its not just a film about love and friendship though its about how its okay to be afraid its a foreign emotion to puss but he learns how to face it no matter the result and whats life without a bit of risk anyway
Dec 23 2022,positive, burned through a bunch more fyc screeners this week with still more to go my gwnyfca picks are in with the complete list of nominations being announced later today 1223 and since my ofcs ballot isnt due until 115 next week will consist of catching all the gwnyfca nominees i havent yet seen to try and make my final vote as close to 100 as possible although i might have to try and sneak out to avatar in theaters in order to do so depending on how the ballot shakes out ill hopefully fit in a few christmas films too since its the season for muppets and michael caine but for those uninterested in yuletide favorites its also the season for awards contenders finally being made available to the masses thanks to santas annual gift of a staggered wednesdayfriday release schedule im a big fan of joanna hoggs films so i was really looking forward to the eternal daughter both because of its connections to her previous two films the souvenir and the souvenir part ii by way of its characters and its foray into the supernatural of sorts shes created a haunted house thriller wherein the ghosts arrive within the baggage of the visitors rather than the old mansionturnedhotel itself julie harts tilda swinton mother rosalind also swinton used to stay there often as a child when it was owned by her aunt so the former thinks it a nice birthday destination for the latter to let those joyous days flood back with them however are also bad days this place held both the playful fun of adolescent adventures and the horrors of trauma julie didnt plan on that darkness she only wanted to give her mother a glimpse into happier times and perhaps use the stories sparked by the memory in a new film shes writing hogg simultaneously delivering its creation and result in a meta play on time finding that despair leaves a mark by ensuring julie retain her own anguish of discovering those truths and the images of what rosalind looked like when relating them it casts a pallor on the entire proceedings wherein julie cannot sleep or work the wind fog and sounds of ghosts keep her trapped in a loop of her own making the film looks great and swinton is great as the doting daughter and increasingly troubled mother whose spiraling demeanor brings with it a reveal thats less surprising than it is welcome hogg casts one actor in two parts to render her compositions as the solution to a technical problem while also solving a narrative one does its discovery warrant ninetyplus minutes of what often feel like repetitive motions confirming what we already know i sadly lean towards no thats not to say the messaging and metaphor dont resonate though i simply posit that they still would if pared down to a thirtyminute short since i couldnt stop checking my watch as one son tragically dies in the water every superstitious fisherman on this remote irish island refuses to learn to swim another returns brian paul mescal has been gone for years telling everyone hed moved to australia despite never sending an address its thus a dream come true for his mother aileen emily watson children who leave rarely come back and those who stay often find themselves drowning like brians old friend mark or languishing in what becomes a prison of the soul so she lets him pick up where he left off working her fatherinlaws oyster farm now that hes unable and her husband declan conlons con couldnt maintain it alone its not what brian ever wanted but aileens never been happier that high doesnt last long however this perfect façade aileen hopes might come to fruition starts stalling when father and son argue about the latter risking his life by working the farm at high tide and threatens to deteriorate once and for all when shes called to the police station to answer a question was brian with her the night of an attack we know what she does namely that she left him at the bar with his old high school flame sarah aisling franciosi and considering the events that transpire the next morning aileen has to know something isnt quite right but can she throw this dream away so soon her instinct is to lie to protect her perfect son at the cost of everything gods creatures is codirected by saela davis and anna rose holmer writer and director of the fits respectively with a similar sense of tension written by shane crowley from a story by fodhla cronin oreilly and himself the plot unfolds with a quiet yet hopeful intensity as we meet the players in this closeknit community thats as quick to mourn a loss as throw the living under the bus to maintain the status quo we can feel a reckoning approaching once the honeymoon of this prodigal sons return starts wearing off but we also want to believe aileens image of her son is pure by defending him without even talking to sarah however she cant help but let reality finally come into focus its a fantastic piece of storytelling with an authentic air of emotion that never feels unearned or embellished this is a boys club world wherein abuse has always been ignored or accepted due to generations of embedded misogyny and while its one thing to look the other way or let it happen to you conscious complicity in someone elses abuse is different what does this choice do to how aileen looks at her son at herself to lie is to let the entire town turn sarah into a pariah and for what more toxic male rage to come more silence for women like her own daughter erin toni orourke to endure their pain alone the films second half the lie occurs exactly at the midpoint is tightly wound to ensure we cannot look away no matter how certain we are something even worse is on the horizon watson and franciosi are amazing their early friendship contrasted by their wordless glaring as though embroiled in a game of chicken that always finds the formers aileen turning in shame first but what i loved the most is how the filmmakers never pretend this culture isnt an intrinsic feature of the landscapethat the way forward wont also be driven by dark secrets its a somber heartcrushing affair where dreams must forever remain unfulfilled fantasy tobias lindholms the good nurse is a pretty solid true life drama that i believe works as well as it does because he and screenwriter krysty wilsoncairns didnt try and turn charles graebers nonfiction novel into a thriller we know charlie cullen eddie redmayne is killing these people thats not up for debate and humanizing him through his genuine friendship with amy loughren jessica chastain doesnt negate that fact id argue he becomes scarier as a result because it proves he is good at his job he has the capacity to save lives you could almost read his story in a way that makes him a warped activist trying to expose the hospital systems penchant for caring more about their financial liability than human lives maybe thats why hes never admitted why that aspect is admittedly the most interesting all the stuff between charlie and amy is familiar territory as far as he was such a nice guy hindsight is concerned where the filmmakers really hit their stride is the investigation headed by noah emmerich and nnamdi asomughas detectives and how their every move is obstructed by the hospitals risk manager played by kim dickens shes impeding their progress because she needs time to get charlie off her payroll before they can charge him with a crime talk about evil and you cant even put all the blame squarely upon her shoulders since she represents the ninth hospital to do so redmayne is great in the role the only reason i watched was because he keeps being mentioned as a potential oscar nominee until a few instances later on when things begin to finally unravel for him hes a walking exemplar of empathyso much so that we never fear for amy or her daughters wellbeing even when lindholm tries to pretend we should as such id argue that its chastain who leaves an even bigger mark between her heart disease the pressures of being a single mother her job responsibilities and navigating the realization that her best friend is a murderer her character is put through the ringer and more shes the good nurse after all the only one who finally did something every time chef slowik ralph fiennes claps his hands to mark a new course the entire dining room jumps in fright and thats before they discover they should be afraid because this exorbitantlypriced exclusive seat at hawthorne comes with a twist  but ill leave that to director mark mylod and screenwriters seth reiss and will tracy since the reveal proves an unforgettable moment of confusion insofar as believing whether what weve seen is real or part of the show we want to assume the latter due to the theatricality and surreal absurdity of it all yet the longer we stay with these characters guests and chefs alike the more we understand that intent is everything the menu delivers a brilliant tonal mix of suspense thrills and humor considering how meticulously matteroffact the inevitable horrors and woefully uptheirownasses the clientele prove between the table of bros arturo castro rob yang and mark st cyr the washed up actor john leguizamo namedropping the chef as a personal friend the elitist critic janet mcteer and her editor paul adelstein and the aging couple reed birney and judith light treating this apparently magical and bankbusting event like just another tuesday theres plenty of fodder for kitchen vs customer antics restaurant host elsa hong chau is only happy to comply but theres also the pathologically oblivious tyler nicholas hoult and his date margot anya taylorjoy hes practically orgasmic the minute they land on the private island knowing his palette will shortly be tasting the worlds greatest food she couldnt care less because she was a lastminute additionone that has thrown slowik and his staff for a loop the reason is crucial to the insanity to come and her background methodically constructed to allow the expository themes of service industry rage to grab a foothold for their explanation rather than merely screaming it into a void populated by those immune to its point is the whole a bit too perfect in its plotting as a result perhaps that precision is actually one of the best parts of the first hour considering how much comedy is born from it fiennes chau and the restaurant staff are impeccable in their deadpan deliveries to offset the mounting frustration and shock their actions provoke from the eaters this juxtaposition is so good that the whole suffers a bit when the truth of whats happening and margots presence are finally reconciled the third act proves somewhat rushed and messy the joke finding its limits with apparently nowhere to go thankfully however mylod and company do stick the landing pivoting back to cold calculating finality with just a hint of earned albeit conveniently compassion brett morgens moonage daydream is by all accounts a sensory experience rather than your usual idea of a documentaryrock biographical or otherwise sanctioned by the late david bowies estate morgen comes in and hyperkinetically edits together a twoplus hour epic of archival footage and interviews to juxtapose our assumptions with his public image and artistic prowess via an overarching representation of the icons essence its not going to be for everyone due to its nonlinear linearity expressionistic aesthetic and overlong runtime but even its detractors must admit the audacity of the enterprise is worth a look i enjoyed it i didnt love it would that opinion have changed had i seen it during its imax run maybe its definitely built for a large screen and deafening surroundsound so those attributes are perhaps a requisite for the socalled transcendence that many are quick to describe thats not to say it isnt effective on a 50inch television with a soundbar too as a fan of the artist and the music it was a treat to see and hear what morgen did in the edit bay although the repetitive footage was a distraction to breathe new life into the artifacts would i prefer a more straightforward biography yes these things can often trend towards the realization that we let celebritiesartists talk too much rather than simply letting the work speak for itself because rather than clamor to watch this specific interpretation again in many ways it says more about morgens relationship with an enigma than bowie himself my first thought upon its completion was to fire up a couple albums and youtube a few music videosthose that were included and especially those that werent what if before intentionally earning a court martial at west point edgar allan poe helped solve a murder that ultimately drew thematic parallels to his later work with the assistance of prophetic poems told to him in dream by his dead mother well louis bayard sought to answer that question with his novel the pale blue eye presently adapted by writerdirector scott cooper for the big screen poe harry melling is but a cadet who fancies himself a poeta bystander with an aptitude for problem solving that intrigues lead character augustus landor christian bale enough to hire him on the sly as his man inside the victim an apparent suicide whose body was later relieved of its heart postmortem with a sprawling cast that relegates robert duvall and charlotte gainsbourg to only a couple scenes each so as not to bog down the proceedings cooper drops us into the hudson valleys isolated militarized zone with everyone onedge about rumors of satanic rituals landor is hired by the school itself to try and keep matters inhouse his reputation as an investigator of renown enough to gloss over his recent bout of alcoholism as a result of the death and disappearance of his wife and daughter respectively he and poe strike up a infectious rapport as they try to uncover a mystery that gets more complicated by the day  and rising body count marked by a finelytuned narrative progression that dabbles in the occult to keep the players and us on our toes theres really nobody onscreen who doesnt set off our radars at least once the captain simon mcburney whos always watching with a skeptical eye from the fringes the school doctor toby jones whos either careless or conniving as far as his current coroner work his eccentric wife gillian anderson their ill daughter lucy boynton and brashly confident son harry lawtey the latters peer group of other cadets speaking in riddles and inside jokes fred hechinger and joey brooks heck even poe himself melling is very good once lies are revealed landor must absorb it all the film starts down a suspense thriller road before settling into what becomes a rather straightforward murder mystery complete with longwinded recaps and brainstorming sessions between landor and poe that ultimately lead towards a grand poirotesque unraveling of hidden truths cooper keeps a tight ship with some wellplaced imagery of what haunts landor bale is also great setting the mood and also the stage for whats to come it gets much darker than i anticipated and excels at maintaining an air of sophisticated drama while also delving into some horror corners and despite the denouement not proving too difficult to guess it never feels forced a solid piece allaround eleven years is a long time to wait for a sequel but here we are getting puss in boots the last wish anyway i guess you can justify it when youre talking about a spinoff to what was dreamworks flagship animated franchiseespecially with a planned reboot of shrek also on the docket you cap your quadrilogy with puss in boots in 2011 bide time to ride the how to train your dragon wave and then dip your toes back into the fairy tale universe housing far far away with a standalone lark first give us another adventure with swashbuckling hero puss in boots antonios banderas to set the table you could say all those years passed for the characters too considering screenwriters paul fisher and tommy swerdlow position mortality as the central theme of our return puss is back at his usual antics dripping in ego and invincibility when he suddenly wakes upon a doctors table to learn hes just lost his eighth life that means he only has one lefta fact he initially brushes off with a shrug before coming facetoface with the big bad wolf wagner moura is the latters bounty hunter truly skilled enough to take puss down and finally pierce his skin with a blade or has all this talk of dying shaken puss into losing his edge either way retirement seems his sole alternative to oblivion rather than end the story in anonymity however croods a new age director joel crawford and company introduce the myth of the last wish with big jack horner john mulaney goldilocks florence pugh and her bear crime family ray winstone olivia colman and samson kayo and kitty softpaws salma hayek pinault all on its trail its only fitting that puss would join one last thrill ride in the hopes of wishing his lives back and while they all crave something they think they need but might already have save jack as hes literally just a selfaware soulless ghoul along comes little perrito harvey guillén wanting for nothing but friendship like all the best dogs do its a kitchen sinktype chaotic race through the magical dark forest with life lessons flashbacks and the irreverent humor weve come to love from this franchise i could do without the animestyle herkyjerky fight aesthetic shifting from 3d to a faux2d perspective but otherwise enjoyed the animation upgrade the bear family is auditioning to be guy ritchies latest band of hapless wannabe thieves mulaney is having way too much fun as a psychopathic nursery rhyme opposite his jiminy cricket facsimile conscience voiced by a jimmy stewartchanneling kevin mccann the wolf lends a legitimate sense of urgency with a dark foreboding and omar little whistle and puss kitty and perrito teach us that a life of love beats legend any day while the calls for rrr rise roar revolt to get an oscar nomination as best picture since india chose last film show for international film consideration instead ultimately making the shortlist are akin to the people who wanted spiderman far from home to get one last yearnamely that the shiny new toy you just saw being fun and exciting doesnt mean its a masterpiecei cant say ss rajamoulis epic isnt still an absolute blast with crazy choreographed fights a ton of romance and humor walltowall computer effects including wild animals that probably didnt need a full disclaimer to tell us as much in case we were worried real tigers etc were used and the most homoerotic leading duo since point break whats not to love about this historicalset fantasy hardly original in narrative with adversaries accidentally becoming best friends only to realize it too late and have to choose between brother and mission it is wild in its orchestration with one climactic fight unfolding fully on piggyback theres some big brain insanity in that respect to offset the otherwise overthetop theatricality of caricatured villains ray stevenson and alison doody as the governor and his bloodthirsty wife leave little scenery left after chowing down every time the camera places them in frame and swooning score but thats tollywood for you its all a heightened state of reality with musical montages interludes naatu naatu made the oscar song shortlist and supernaturalesque sequences imbuing men with godlike powers and why shouldnt bheem nt rama rao jr and ram ram charan teja become gods these are two men who would laugh in the face of danger if they werent so gosh darn serious every time danger rears its head its often very often the former is his peaceful villages champion sent to delhi to rescue a young girl the governor bought by any means necessary the latter is an ambitious royal officer in the governors army looking for a promotion by singlehandedly jumping into a violent gang of indian civilians to arrest someone who dared to throw a rock earning a couple concussions for his trouble they were rendered as gods well before the plot and music lyrics caught up gods patriots lovers and friendstotheend who better to start an explosive revolution why doesnt rama kayije kagame want her family to know shes pregnant thats the central question i took from an extended prologue of sorts wherein she and her white husband adrien thomas de pourquery visit her senegalese mother and sisters for a meal before leaving paris on a work trip everyone exchanges their usual pleasantries asking what theyve been up to etc adrien is careful with his language when explaining that they wont be vacationing this year because of a major project to complete at the house he looks at rama to deliver the news and she avoids the subject dismissing the implication completely why alice diop and her cowriters amrita david and marie ndiaye set the stage for saint omer to deliver a simple answer that rama is nervously unsure of whats to come from an opening dream calling out for her own mother to the obvious strain in their presentday relationship we can assume she fears becoming that which she now resents and its not without reason once memories of conflict and emotional repression rear their head how much of who her mother is will rub off once shes a mother herself is giving birth a mistake will attending the trial of a young woman accused of infanticide help her to see that things could be worse or will doing so prove they already are the juxtaposition is ultimately a heartbreaking one since the reality of laurence colys guslagie malanda case proves much more complex than the news reports her very conservative and white community of saintomer depict they paint her as a murderer a monster and she doesnt necessarily disagree since she admits to the crime but not to the guilt her defense is sorcerythat her aunts cursed her her attorneys defense is insanity the truth lies somewhere inbetween once details reveal that laurences circumstances are so heavily steeped in cultural bias and racist imperatives people ask how this intelligent and eloquent black woman could do such a thing but how do either of those attributes matter laurences parents put undue pressure upon her to be unimpeachable in white society she moved to france to get away from that unspoken oppression only to find herself in saintomer with an older white boyfriend xavier malys luc dumontet and an increasingly hostile air of otherness that led to an unhealthy seclusion her entire life was thus dictated by this idea of manufactured perceptionto be that which others demanded rather than finding that which she embraced rama sees her own insecurities projected throughout the courtroom the preconceptions the assumptions the casual disregard for the fifteenmonthold victim in lieu of deciding which adult was more at fault for her death reading that much of the onscreen scenario was born from lived experience diop like rama sat in on a real infanticide trial herself makes sense considering how meticulously rendered and performed the courtroom scenes are but also because of the emotions diop imbues via her actors performances and her decision to splice in ramas silent memories of a tired mother struggling to survive under the weight of unjust expectation the comparison allows for a refocused understanding of who this woman was because while motherhood is inherently scary and the past present and future of ones own dna and environment exacerbate that terror knowing this truth can also be a blessing no matter how alone you may feel you never truly are i think its official ruben östlund films just arent for me while i enjoyed force majeure a lot yet still not as much as it seemed everyone else around me did the square was simply too scattershot and onthenose to really enjoy it as more than a lark i feel the same about triangle of sadness probably because its pretty much the same filmskewering the fashion world and capitalism instead of the art world both have memorable dinner scenes both possess a game cast with some genuinely hilarious moments and both are way too long östlund has some great ideas but it almost seems his goal is to intentionally push the joke beyond its limits of insufferability i love the idea of satirizing the wealth gap by having outlandishly rich patrons on a yacht juxtaposed against the overworked and fearful help desperately seeking a big tip they probably wont get rich people are often rich because they are the most frugal people alive im not sure östlund actually brings anything new to the table on the topic though he pokes fun at those who earn their wealth with filth zlatko burics shit salesman is an unhinged riot weapons and influence the late charlbi deans yaya and harris dickinson as her boyfriend carl are the straight men and thus de facto leads but only for gags even woody harrelsons comedic timing cant save an underwritten role thats only here as a socialist american foil to burics capitalist russian and the help rarely get more than directions to look awkwardly uncomfortable act one intrigues because of its intimate scale and conversations about gender roles where it pertains to money its just dean and dickinson arguing about financial intent when it comes to dating act two widens the scope by putting them on a cruise well out of their price range yaya got tickets in exchange for some instagram posts but it quickly pushes them to the background to let the caricatures around them act like fools act three flirts with true commentary by leaving a handful of passengers shipwrecked on an island with the yachts toilet manager a wonderful dolly de leon flipping the table to become their leader as the only person who can survive with her own two hands but it never takes the next step östlund is an expert at writing gags but i just cant buy that they add up to anything like so many others apparently can watching darren aronofskys cinematic adaptation of samuel d hunters play the whale doesnt make me wonder how it works onstage as much as how it might work under the guidance of a more sympathetic director thats not to say aronofsky is unsympathetic i think he and brendan fraser bring the character of charlie to life in a way that objectively humanizes him and allows his paincreated from an unyielding anguish and depressionto be understood unfortunately however you cannot deny that aronofsky doesnt also lean into the external horrorinfused perspective that people like charlie are often dismissed as grotesque pitiable monsters its therefore tough to reconcile our desire to empathize with the tempest of emotions surrounding him against an adaptation that seems hellbent on preventing us from doing so its a slippery slope you do need to depict peoples heinous persecution of him since its a part of his story a lot of what charlie has become stems from the stigma that society places upon obesity and homosexuality the trick is thus not using that depiction in a way that intentionally or not normalizes that reaction we spend almost ninety minutes with charlie as he bares his soul while the facts surrounding his struggles fatherhood sexuality religion mental illness etc are revealed why after all that do you then create a scene wherein hes caught in public in such a way that the person who sees him runs away what does that add its one thing if the film was about said reaction en route to judging societys shortcomings but its not it doesnt so choosing to portray it anyway feeds into calls of exploitation you dont need that shame to then catalyze charlies subsequent decision to voluntarily be seen thinking you do is lazy what a shame too considering the performances aronofsky receives from fraser the fat suit while problematic was always going to prove necessary for financing since this film doesnt get made with an unknown entity whos naturally that size and hong chau as his friendnurse liz they imbue a bottomless wealth of compassion and history to these charactersso much so that the love they share easily outweighs the cruelty of others sneaking in their tenderness provides the leeway to let sadie sinks ellie charlies estranged daughter be so vicious she has every reason to be that way after all his obesity is merely an easy target with which to package her justified rage it does beg us to ask the million dollar question though why make charlie obese at all because being able to narratively use it as a means of manifesting his selfloathing and guilt isnt good enough that renders it a stunt and ultimately feeds into the stigma rather than combat it you can argue that its just one example of many instances of psychological trauma onscreen but its the only one that takes physical shape ellies issues dont utilize a fat suit thomas ty simpkins dont either at a certain point charlies disability stops being a character trait to become the entire character and yet the film continually refuses to acknowledge it because it would rather just use it as a trigger for charlie to want to get his affairs in order that way hunter can ratchet up the drama via more secrets couched in a notsodeep commentary on red state politics without ever confronting the sickness itself because without fraser and chaus performances thats all this really is a shallow plea for kindness in a world so cynical that people have grown less accepting than they already were in hopes that god gives them a reserved seat at the apocalypse and in that gaping silence was the real horror what a line its spoken via narration towards the beginning of sarah polleys adaptation of miriam toews novel women talkingwords born from hindsight by one of the young girls residing in the strict mennonite colony where it is set shes providing context for the meeting thats being held in a hayloft between the women of three families attempting to decide the fate of all women in their community the silence is their lack of language education and privilege to fight back the horror is their subsequent inability to band together and stop the atrocities committed upon them by their men while also allowing themselves to become involuntarily complicit to that violence its the product of a power void those same men created and continue to enforce to maintain their control and the time has come to fill it with righteous fury while the events onscreen are fictional and described as such by a clarifying caption dont be fooled into believing its exercise isnt based in truth im certain there will be some viewers who discover that it takes place in 2010 and scoff ignorant to the fact that toews loosely based the scenario on real events that occurred in bolivia circa 2011 there like here saw the rampant and unchecked domestic abuse and rape by men from the community against their wives sisters daughters and neighbors with the assistance of animal tranquilizers the women in the film were told they were hallucinating lying for attention victims of ghosts or demons only when one caught her attacker and forced him to name names were they finally arrested so the colony leaders did the only thing they could do threaten the women to forgive their abusers or lose their place in heaven in another of many brilliant lines of dialogue its explained that these women who cannot read or write quickly teach themselves how to vote there are three choices to decide between while all the men are in town trying to bail out their brethren stay and forgive stay and fight or leave and never return the narrative premise is that the democratic process ends in a threeway tie pitting three of the most wellrespected families against each other to hold a debate frances mcdormands domineering and scarred janz wont be swayed from forgiveness salome claire foy daughter of agata judith ivey wants blood her sister ona rooney mara impregnated by her rapist sees leaving as the freedom to witness a world thats been kept from them add gretas sheila mccarthy desire to at least try finding consensus despite her daughter mariche jessie buckley angrily interrupting and refuting the others points and the stage is set for a rousing dialogue that moves between indignation introspection pragmatism unbridled emotion and even a few wellplaced hints of humor we hear their respective cases watch as they alter minds and change their own and get transported back to their individual traumas with effectively rendered flashbacks that always prove contextually relevant to the current topic of conversation faith pacifism education love autonomy it may just be eight women and their minutestaker ben whishaws recently returned august arguing in one room for the duration but its the most dynamic and tense film ive seen all year because you dont know how things will shake out the narration teases that some of these women leave but says nothing about the nightmarish drama that could potentially occur beforehandwhether by the mens early return or the women passionately defending their right to not back down foy is a force of nature buckley is heartbreaking in her nihilism ivey and mccarthy deliver steadying maternal hands of wisdom earned from decades of knowing what forgiveness has already wrought and whishaw along with august winters melvin devastates as a masculine counterpoint that strengthens the womens resolve were witnessing a reckoninga rebellious cry to erase that silence once and for all with tears of sadness for whats left behind and joy for whats to come and above all else relief heres a fun one from kuffs wherein tony goldwyn

Dec 23 2022,positive, typically when it comes to films and sequels especially spending years in development hell can be a very bad sign the difficulties in getting the product completed can reflect too many creative energies clashing or a lack of clear direction it can lead to countless script revisions studio interference and perhaps worst of all indifference from a public who no longer care about the property but sometimes a wait is very much worth it if the product is visually stunning emotionally resonant and entertaining as hell despite some minor weaknesses in the story im talking of course about puss in boots the last wish set after the events of the shrek films we open on puss in boots antonio banderas discovering that hes down to the last of his nine lives after a brief stint laying low at a cat shelter he decides to seek out a legendary wishing star to get the rest of his lives back but hes not the only one seeking it goldilocks florence pugh and the three bears crime family also want the star as does big jack horner john mulaney then theres the alpha wolf bounty hunter wagner moura tracking puss to take him in dead or alivepreferably dead puss enlists the help of kitty softpaws salma hayek and a wannabe therapy dog harvey guillén to get to the star before anyone else does and before the wolf can take him out as someone who doesnt care much for the shrek franchise as a whole i found the original puss in boots to be a breath of fresh air it was less concerned with fairy tale satire and far more focused on telling a fun story in fact the fairy tale elements were the least enjoyable parts of it it was just a thrilling adventure with great animation excellent voice acting a tight and committed cast and one of the best dance battles ive ever seen on film the spanish setting gave the film an infectious energy and distinct identity separate from the fantasy grab bag of the shrek films  but the last wish isnt simply a recreation of what made the first film sing this is an evolution in nearly all ways from the visuals to the story to the voice acting nearly everything here is better the second time around and even the flaws of the first film are less pronounced here  the films animation is probably the most obvious change here inspired by the phenomenal animation of into the spiderverse the visuals in the last wish have a distinct style separate from whats come before instead of aiming for more realistic textures and movement the animation here is designed to more closely resemble a storybook theres a remarkable painterly vibe to the animation giving it a look thats both innovative and oddly sweetly vintage some of the action scenes are also highlighted by a change in frame rate and speed adding a kind of animestyle hyperreality accent to set pieces that are already full of tight precise choreography that includes the adrenalinefueled opening that has puss going up against a tree giant and using a church bell as a weapon the visuals have matured and grown divorcing themselves from the shiny sleek approach of the shrek films i really cant stress how appealing and intriguing the animation here is from the perspective of a lifelong animation fan seeing a unique animated approach from a mainstream studio makes my heart leap just a little its a level of care and commitment that shows through in the final product the stunning visual palette is perfectly echoed by heitor pereias dynamic multicolored score that blends acoustic and electronic and is capable of both sunsoaked kinetic action and graceful elegiac emotion  the vocal performances have also matured in more ways than one its not just a matter of the returning cast having themselves aged whereas the original film took place before the events of shrek 2 this is set at some point after the last shrek film hearing a gruffer deeper and more wonderfully aged voice coming out of puss is highly appropriate and antonio banderas does not disappoint puss has become an iconic character almost entirely based on banderas charming performance and clear love for the role compared to the previous puss film the character here is just as full of bravado and daringdo but thats underlined by a worldweariness and as we find out paralyzing fear of death that hes only barely able to hide its a multilayered performance thats beautiful to see and hear banderas isnt alone though in general the voice cast is entirely on their game and knocking it out of the dark forest salma hayeks kitty softpaws is the definite yin to puss yang her energy just as anarchic but much more controlled and subtle than puss exuberance hayek is a fantastic counterpoint to banderas and just like in the first film the two play off of each other perfectly theyre complimented even further by harvey guilléns perrito whos earnestness and innocence always comes off as endearing and not annoying its almost impossible to dislike the character even as his wideeyed approach to the world gets under the fur of the more cynical and pragmatic puss and kitty the antagonists here get just as much screen time as the good guys and thats for the most part a good thing florence pughs goldilocks is just a fun time and her being at the head of a crime family of bears taps into a very specific form of logic the family dynamic is balanced well and pugh is capably backed up by olivia coleman and ray winstone who plays affable thuggery like a fine art however the most intriguing character by far is wagner mouras wolf he has a legitimately terrifying design with his glowing red eyes intimidating build and a supersharp sickle in each hand mouras performance is chilling and hypnotic in equal measures and his mere presence gives the film a deliciously uncomfortable undercurrent of threatening inescapable darkness that might seem like an odd quality to compliment in an animated film but it makes perfect sense here this is a story about facing your own limitations and in the case of puss your own mortality its an very adult existential crisis but its handled with care and attention for the first time in a long time puss has come face to face with his own fears no longer able to hide them with his heroic persona this is sometimes literal whenever the wolf draws near every hair on puss body stands on end seeing puss in such a vulnerable way gives him new dimensions and depth making his adventures more than just a fun time  a strong theme in the story here is appreciation for what we have instead of focusing on what we lack or more importantly what we think we need to be happy and how we discover the truth between the two the topic itself might not be terribly original but the execution of it is handled well when the characters reach the pocket dimension where the wishing star is kept they discover that the land itself shifts based on whos holding the treasure map and what obstacles they need to face to realize their inner truth and confront their own selfdoubt the film mines some deep psychological depths but packages them in a very digestible colorful way  not every part of the story works as well as it should however despite john mulaneys solid performance big jack horner is a poorlysketched and fleshedout character with the most basic motivations and backstory of the cast he wants the star just so he can have all the magic power in the world and thats it hes your average sociopath bully but armed with a bag of holding full of pilfered fairy tale artifacts and magical creatures he uses a phoenix as a flamethrower at one point theres a reason hes the least highlighted character in the trailers and especially compared a genuinely compelling villain like the wolf he comes off as almost completely unnecessary the threat he poses comes off as too basic compared to the wolf and especially to puss own inner demons jacks continued presence in the film gives it a feeling of it being slightly overstuffed and the inescapable feeling that time spent with jack could be spent better by focusing on literally any other character regardless of jack horning in on the plot puss in boots the last wish is a refreshingly and surprisingly complex film disguised as a lighthearted animated adventure and thats a very good thing while still thriving on the swashbuckling vibe of puss previous exploits this film frames them in the context of maturity and the holistic nature of our lifes path this isnt just a fun exciting quest this is a fun exciting quest with a highly relatable highly emotional candy center who knew that a sequel to a shrek spinoff would be so damn satisfying on so many levels
Dec 23 2022,positive, puss in boots the last wish is the sequel we didnt know we needed with a fairy taleinspired animation style that differs from the more realistic look of the previous shrek films this second theatrical outing for the title feline distinguishes itself from other franchise offerings when puss antonio banderas vanquishes a giant monster threatening a village a large bell crashes violently down on top of the swashbuckling hero the shocking death is met with some joking when the famous cat breathes again looking no worse for wear but this death his eighth in his lifetime is cause for alarm puss in boots is on his last life after a visit from a frightening bounty hunter named the wolf wagner moura puss realizes one more death might really be the end of the line and wolf is more than capable and plenty happy to usher puss into the nether world determined to stay alive the eternally selfabsorbed puss hangs up his hat and cape burying them in the yard of mama luna only murders in the building star davine joy randolph with whom he seeks refuge in his retirement but an existence as a house cat proves to be a daunting undertaking as the weeks pass puss grows a beard and gains a companion a dog harvey gullién from the series what we do in the shadows masquerading as a cat but when retirement is interrupted by a call from goldilocks florence pugh and her three protective bears puss begins to rethink his choice to leave the adventurer game behind he surreptitiously learns from goldi that there is a wishing star out there that might restore his lost eight lives puss and his little dog then set out on a journey to find the magical treasure the last wish is excellent family entertainment banderas is in fine form delivering his characters lines with droll confidence just the way he refers to himself puss in boots gets a recurring giggle it rolls off the tongue infectiously making it an instant earworm and the story is populated with many colorful fairy taleinspired faces that subvert their classic origins for example little jack horner becomes big jack horner voiced with an acerbic wit by comedian john mulaney hes armed to the teeth with magical weapons retrieved at will from a bottomless nanny bag and naturally his relentless henchman makes up the bakers dozen but embedded with all the zany comedy bits is some effective pathos puss rekindles a romance with kitty softpaws the voice of salma hayek of course and his faithful dog becomes his comfort animal as puss copes with the anxiety associated with only having a single life left however florence pughs goldilocks might warm your heart since three roughandtumble bears raised goldi shes lost something of her delicate human identity and while the bears have done the best they can to accommodate the young woman she longs to harness the power of the wishing star to return to her own kind goldis relationship with her bear family is quite endearing olivia colman and ray winstone are excellent choices for mama and papa bear which only adds to the depth of the bond even though goldi and the three bears are initially revealed as thieving villains its hard not to root for them and when the film concludes i suspect weve not seen the end of this foursome in any future installments the last wish borrows the animation style we saw earlier this year in the bad guys which might remind viewers of the look of the oscarwinning spiderman into the spiderverse the images are very fluid and pleasing to watch and dont have the strange uncanny qualities that marked the earlier shrek films
Dec 23 2022,positive,while most of the passively enjoyable first film eludes memory this sequel packs a solid story that should hold the interest of all ages terrific new characters big laughs and the endless joy of antonio banderas voicing our now more mortal hero
Dec 23 2022,positive, twelve years after the shrek spinoff puss in boots the sassy spanish feline voiced by antonio banderas has returned for another fairy talebusting adventure directed by joel crawford and januel mercado and written by paul fischer with a story by tommy swerdlow and tom wheeler crawford mercado and fischer all worked on the dreamworks animation favorites trolls and croods a new age and the trio bring a similar chaotic good energy to puss in boots the last wish which remixes a new set of familiar nursery rhymes and beloved childrens fables to entertaining ends our titular tabby is living a swashbucklers life swilling leche singing songs saving towns raking in the adoration and accolades when he dies his eighth death landing him in his ninth and final life spooked by a visit from the grimreaping big bad wolf wagner moura puss decides to hang up his hat and boots and head for retirement in the home of a crazy cat lady mama luna davine joy randolph the times is committed to reviewing theatrical film releases during the covid19 pandemic because moviegoing carries risks during this time we remind readers to follow health and safety guidelines as outlined by the cdc and local health officials but he cant escape adventure and soon puss is caught up in the quest for a magical wish which is in the possession of a greedy pieproducing hoarder of enchanted trinkets little jack horner john mulaney remember him with the christmas pie and the plum on his thumb jack now quite big also is pursued by goldilocks florence pugh and her cockney crime syndicate family of bears ray winstone olivia colman samson kayo who want the wish to make things just right of course with his former flame kitty softpaws salma hayek and new pup friend perro harvey guillén joining in on the race to grab the wish puss learns how to cherish his one precious life by making a new friend or burying the hatchet with kitty this is all explicated with fast funny dialogue and therapystyle lessons delivered by an actual therapy dog blissedout chihuahua perro is more than happy to stop and smell the roses and as it turns out thats a good way to make it through this maze called life the irreverent twist on familiar characters makes puss in boots the last wish entertaining the fact that it doesnt overstay its welcome at a brisk 1 hour 40 minutes helps too what makes it great is the experimental and creative building of this world the animation is dizzyingly fast and crisp but its the production design by nate wragg and art direction by joseph feinsilver that sets this film apart the backgrounds upon which puss and pals traipse reference candyland and francisco goya with a roughhewn painterly quality  that evokes a warm appealing texture as if you can see brushstrokes other settings are technicolor hallucinatory fantasyscapes while the big bad wolfs angular lines and grayscale palette set off his gleaming red eyes and call to mind the aesthetic of a noir graphic novel banderas purring puss has long been a favorite shrek character and he has great chemistry with hayeks kitty but the rest of the cast brings charismatic vocal performances as well including pugh with her distinctive low tone and moura known for his role on narcos who makes his wolf singularly scary puss in boots the last wish is one gorgeous and dynamic fractured fairy tale

his most recent novel is banned in boston he is the 2018 recipient of the skylark award given by the new england science fiction association he lives in somerville massachusetts no its not a terrible review its a review you disagreed with  i found the animation and storytelling creepy inept and offputting  you didnt  youre entitled to your opinion as i am entitled to mine  learn that people can have different opinions than yours  thats what makes them opinions completely disagree with this review the animation was striking inspiration from the amazing into the spiderverse methinks the action scenes often breathtaking the voice acting top drawer the story full of heart the main bad guy terrifying and created genuine jeopardy  maybe it sags a little in the middle but man i really wish all animation had this ambition im 47 years old my 7 and 8 year olds both thought it was a 1010 also loved it its not family feud and your job isnt to guess what the survey says your job is indeed simply to say whatever crosses your mind but a critics value relates to how intune they are with reality and with the publics general taste an opinion so out of touch is frankly worthless it does not help prospective viewers in making a decision it does not provide a reliable feedback for the creators and it does not reflect the worlds views so i would ask what is your job really what kind of value do you provide if you cant even recognize a good movie when you watch it and im not just saying that its statistically objective its hardly objective my job is not to validate the box office  audiences bought tickets for the transformers movies  that doesnt require me to reflect the worlds views or the publics general taste my advice has always been to find a critic youre on the same wavelength with and listen to him or her not to insist that a critic must reflect back your views your review is weak i normally try to understand others perspective but you give so little definition to your opinions i just cant agree with this review please  give me an better understanding why you would give this movie such a low score it feels like you didnt watch the film or squinted through you fingers whilst watching it the animation was top tier as cartoons and anime go the storytelling was on point teaching others about their own mortality for puss what a real family is like with goldilocks how to trust with kitty and that some people really are just scum inside with jack horner it feels like you dont understand that people can have different opinions and both are valid ive never told someone they were wrong if they saw a movie and had a different take than me critics are not here to validate your opinions just watched it and i completely agree with your review albeit we appear to be in the minority its a mess of a film forever trying to move forward the action through surreal twists this somehow worked for me in the croods a new age but not here it was just flat the dog was annoying the bears even more do  redeeming it somewhat are a few genuinely good jokes and a few decent meaningful interactions between puss and kitty and goldilocks and the bears before we lurch off again into a look at this isnt it zany acid trip thanks there are several oscar nominations i dont get including several for the horrible triangle of sadness its okay to be in the minority on a film  its the rare film that scores either 100 or 0 on rotten tomatoes what people need to understand is these are opinions and theyre not wrong simply because mine is different from yours absolutely im in the minority on several other films cough cough batman begins cough cough still i was surprised by the volume of positives for this dogs breakfast of a film on rotten tomatoes hence spotting yours while i do love this movie i understand that we arent a collective hivemind that all have to think the same way about it with that being said do you have any thoughts on how they could have improved the movie in your eyes also your comment about the movies animation being grotesque has made me curious what style of animation would you say that you prefer artistically this is gorgeous the story is simple but has a great flow to it the characters are fun to watch their growth explored the score hits familiar bests and could be better at some points but nothing is boring  the animation is groundbreaking grotesque characters nonwithstanding grotesque is welcome and appreciated befitting the role scar was a grouesque lion he was perfect exaggerated proportions are key ingredient to characters in most animated movies  sure i bet there were people who did not love the lion king who did not appreciate the secret of nimh who hated felidae who were appalled by every classic in existence and thats fine but when they tell others of these experiences for a living they should try to explain better how their opinions were formed and hopefully go deeper than saying x was bad
Dec 23 2022,positive, the spanish actor debuted in the second shrek film and has supplied the voice of suave confident puss in several more as well as in his own puss features and shorts banderas stole scenes in every one because his characterization is so cartoonishly selfassured and because when he wants sympathy the way animators shift him from latin lover to bigeyed kittycat is hilarious its surprising then and surprisingly delightful that the last wish is willing to shake up the formula puss dies at the beginning for instance leaving him with just one of his nine lives and having multiple lives seems to have been the source of much of his bravado so he spends the rest of the movie in a sort of purgatory thats similar to the world he came from except he cant assume that everyone will bow down to him anymore and hes stuck with a dog sidekick who annoys the heck out of him voiced by harvey guillén its fun to see puss laid low and in need of help from others so both story decisions are great so are the primo actors in the cast olivia colman adopts a workingclass accent to play the mama bear whose bed goldilocks once occupied and florence pugh is the goldenlocked ingrate who seems to have been hanging out with the dimwitted bear family for at least a decade longer than shed like the bright script hands out zingers to both of them and to salma hayek as puss willtheyorwontthey its easy to recommend all of that stuff to fans of banderas or of the offkilter fairy tale universe of shrek but the visual aspects of the film are not as strong the main characters have the clarity and detail of the shrek movies but much of the rest of puss is substandard particularly when early scenes call for lots of background characters all of whom have the blank bland look of lowbudget animation those scenes look like they were completed hastily or with small screens in mind so maybe it would be wise to wait a couple of months until puss is available to watch them on those screens at home
Dec 23 2022,negative, not sure what to see on boxing day our critics rate the new releases including from left i wanna dance with somebody the banshees of inisherin matilda triangle of sadness and the new puss in boots theres no bigger date on the australian movie calendar than boxing day and as always theres a rash of new releases on december 26 promising something for everyone well for almost everyone with every other distributor seemingly running scared in the face of disneys avatar the way of water theres a surprising lack of blockbuster action this year the end of the year is typically when the big hollywood studios release what they hope will be their awards contenders so it is that the banshees of inisherin triangle of sadness which won the top prize at the cannes film festival in may and the lost king make their bows with another big contender  steven spielbergs the fabelmans  to follow on january 5 but if this is a great time of year for lovers of serious cinema its also a treat for families with an animated puss in boots adventure the liveactionanimated hybrid musical lyle lyle crocodile and netflixs film of matilda the musical all arriving and for fans of music divas theres a mustsee biopic of whitney houston therell be plenty more over summer too and our team of film writers and critics will be covering all the big new releases so stay tuned but for now heres our guide to the boxing day movies enjoy barring a prediction or two from a local soothsayer the banshees of inisherin contains no element of fantasy as such but this latest bucolic tragicomedy from writerdirector martin mcdonagh three billboards outside ebbing missouri has a quaint otherworldly flavour that suggests the chronicle of a squabble between hobbits though born and raised in london mcdonagh has made his irish heritage go a long way the action takes place in 1923 just off irelands west coast the fictional inisherin is played by the reallife island of inishmore pictured as a jigsaw puzzle of lush green fields encircled by lowlying dry stone walls much as it was in 1934 when robert flaherty arrived to shoot his pioneering docudrama man of aran famously flaherty was engaged in the kind of quest for authenticity that paid little heed to the truth  portraying his islanders as engaged in a constant battle for brute survival even when not taking to the open sea for their allegedly traditional shark hunts by contrast mcdonagh makes no claim to even the loosest kind of realism his inisherin is less a functioning community than an unlikely haven for slowwitted middleaged celibates dedicated to taking it easy this viewer never quite managed to fathom how the gormless padraic colin farrell a nominal cattle farmer sharing a tworoom cottage with his sensible sister kerry condon manages to afford his nightly pints of guinness and his priceylooking knitwear whatever his duties entail he has all the time in the world for what he calls normal chats with his best friend colm brendan gleeson  until colm who wants more time for playing the fiddle loses patience with his mates ramblings and warns padraic never to speak to him again what are you 12 a neighbour says incredulously that if anything is overgenerous as so often with mcdonagh the characters are basically overgrown preschoolers whose impulsive choices have all too permanent consequences a similar childish quality is evident in mcdonaghs own undimmed zest for cheap shock effects anyone familiar with his past work will not be surprised to hear that the action turns increasingly gruesome nor that theres a subplot involving sexual abuse no less standardised are the musical repetitions of the dialogue which relies heavily on having the characters say feck whenever the pace starts to lag in all these respects mcdonagh isnt too far from his american counterparts such as quentin tarantino or the coen brothers  trafficking as they do in a menacing absurdism that can be traced back to the plays of harold pinter but as an entertainer he doesnt quite have the agility of his transatlantic cousins the fanciful material of banshees calls for a more visually stylised approach than anything he can muster without that its hard to swallow the plot contrivances and tonal shifts of the films third act let alone the vague hints of an allegory for the irish civil war still the core subject here  the pain of rejection  is so close to universal that few viewers will fail to respond farrells pleading puppyish features seem made to convey every shade of hurt and bafflement and mcdonagh puts them to work in closeup as padraic moves through the stages of grief in a manner both funny and heartbreaking is truth really the daughter of time josephine teys celebrated 1951 novel based on that proverb has a scotland yard inspector in hospital with a broken leg trying to resolve the question of richard iii i read the daughter of time in high school in an earlier century i dimly remember its conclusions that the popular vision of richard as a hunchback who murdered the princes in the tower was a lie planted by the tudors and promoted by their pet playwright richard was nothing like the horseless psycho in shakespeares play philippa langley was one of these socalled ricardians when we meet her character in stephen frears patchy and polemical film she is a tiny sickly edinburgh woman with two boys and an exhusband played by steve coogan coogan also cowrote the script with jeff pope reuniting the team that made philomena sally hawkins an elfin treasure of the british screen has never given a bad performance nor is this one but she is illserved by the team in effect the movie manipulates langleys story for its own ends while accusing others of doing the same thing to richard the real langley is a screenwriter who began investigating richard for a film project no mention of that here she was one of the initiators of the richard project not a sole eccentric voice she did wander into a council car park in leicester and come over all funny when she saw the letter r on the asphalt she has said repeatedly that she felt richard was there buried below the movie ignores the fact that a historian suggested in 1975 that he was there the church in which he was buried in 1485 had been demolished centuries earlier langley was pivotal in getting the agreement to dig the richard project raised the money to pay an archaeological company based at leicester university who thought the project would fail when they did find richard the university bigwigs claimed the credit shuffling langley and the ricardians aside that part at least appears to have some truth frears and coogan were outraged by this so they construct a film about a battler winning against all odds langley has chronic fatigue syndrome she identifies with the way richard has been demonised for his condition  an easy metaphor hawkins quivers with indignation throughout reaching a point where i thought she might break her performance does not lack commitment just someone to guide it how much human degradation and depravity is too much like the waiter in the monty python sketch about the overweight man in a restaurant swedish iconoclast ruben ostlund keeps offering us just a waferthin slice to take us over the edge where discomfort becomes the point he wants to make a movie that is worth leaving the house for its basically a longish vomitcomet of cinematic bile and guile for ostlund subtlety is overrated triangle of sadness shows us why he has a point its a spectacular demolition of modern life a disruptor movie full of ideas and nuance as violent in its way as a pieter bruegel painting ostlund grew up on a swedish island and his mother was a teacher and a communist he has no difficulty in identifying the enemy the surprise is how sympathetic he is once he has them up against the wall squirming like an insect on a pin a brief introduction throws us into the gorgeous lives of two models yaya south african actress charlbi dean kriek earns four times as much as carl harris dickinson but still expects him to pay for dinner after a spectacular argument brings them closer they board a super yacht as invited guests yaya is an influencer accustomed to her beauty opening all doors its her currency the location is unclear but it feels like the mediterranean somewhere near greece ostlund assembles a basket of deplorables most of whom are only there because theyre rich an impeccably mannered english duo cutely named winston and clementine oliver ford davies and amanda walker enjoy a family fortune built on land mines and hand grenades fat russian billionaire dimitry zlatko buric declares proudly that i sell shit his wife vera sunnyi melles pickled in champagne gives outlandish orders to the exquisitely polite crew money buys obeisance in his cabin the alcoholic marxist captain woody harrelson refuses to come out when a storm hits the ship the marxist and the russian capitalist get so trolleyed they take turns reading the communist manifesto over the pa meanwhile most of the passengers are hurling the contents of the sevencourse captains dinner then the sewage tanks overflow ostlund does not hold back this is one of the most revolting and hilarious sequences in the history of movies a brilliantly satirical squareup as nature overturns privilege the survivors wash up on a deserted island neither beauty nor money means anything now abigail dolly de leon a filipina who cleaned toilets on the ship finds a new role she knows how to fish its like gilligans island meets the hunger games ostlund made some waves with force majeure and the square triangle of sadness bolts onto those as the grand finale of a trilogy about masculinity in trouble in a world without pity or moral compass force majeure was about a family falling apart ostlund indicted the art world and its patrons in the square he dissects multiple forms of privilege here from beauty to heredity to sheer dumb luck but he does it with compassion he loves the characters he tortures theres an emotionally powerful shot here with one character crying over the body of another until this both had seemed like empty shells the victims of their own misbegotten fortune death and grief make them human again what more is there to say about whitney houston whose brilliant career drugtaking and premature death has been hashed over exhaustively on screen and in the tabloids i wanna dance with somebody tackles that question by taking her story back to the music its written by new zealander anthony mccarten whose screenplay for bohemian rhapsody didnt dilute the tragedies in freddie mercurys short life while still managing to evoke the exhilaration to be had from queens greatest concerts it took a delicate touch and other rock stars havent been as fortunate while rocketman was just as exuberant in doing justice to elton john as a performer the aretha franklin biopic respect 2021 became more depressing as it went on the united states vs billie holiday also released last year was the same it was powerful but it was no celebration then there was baz luhrmanns elvis which was more glitz than heart clouded by the decision to tell the tale from the venal viewpoint of presleys manager colonel tom parker members of houstons family were interviewed at length for a documentary four years ago but for this film also produced with the familys cooperation director kasi lemmons made extensive use of the singers original recordings including those laid down en route to the final versions it allowed star naomi ackie to take houstons false starts double takes and spontaneous comments as prompts in shaping her performance although she was filmed singing her voice was replaced by houstons she does well catching the contradictions in houstons character  the naivete the fear of failure the rebellious streak and its effect on her religious convictions but physically ackie bears only a superficial resemblance to the singer with houstons image still so fresh in the memory this is a distraction the script is impressionistic in style covering a lot of ground by being selective and using houstons songs to drive the narrative much is made of her relationship with the record company chief clive davis one of the films producers who discovered houston and helped her choose songs for her albums hes played by a wryly urbane stanley tucci giving us a character whose iron fist is well covered in velvet appalled when houston takes up smoking he looks sadly at her as she lights up remarking that its like watching a stradivarius being left out in the rain the film falls a little short of its claim to be wartsandall condensing the low points in houstons turbulent marriage to bobby brown ashton sanders but it doesnt hold back in dealing with her fathers financial mismanagement nor does it underplay the importance of her enduring friendship with her former lover robyn crawford  played with a lot of verve by nafessa williams roald dahl was not the first storyteller to acknowledge many childrens taste for the macabre  the brothers grimm and hans christian andersen got there before him but nobody has ever extracted as much fun from this discovery as dahl has matilda wormwood alisha weir is one of dahls most popular creations  a small girl forced to survive as best she can in a world governed by some of the most malevolent grownups in childrens literature her parents andrea riseborough and stephen graham are bad enough  crass venal and spiteful with voices piercing enough to shatter glass  but miss trunchbull headmistress of crunchem hall the gothic house of horrors that is matildas school is worse shes a monster trunchbull was played by a man when matilda the musical began its triumphal march across the worlds stages when the screen adaptation was announced it seemed the role would go to ralph fiennes instead trunchbull is brought hideously to life by an unrecognisable emma thompson her face looks as if it has been moulded out of concrete while she stamps around her domain in a getup with an unsettling resemblance to a stormtrooper uniform thompson abandoned her vanity long ago but this creation goes quite a few grotesque steps further than her nanny mcphee of the single bucktooth and hairy mole matilda is sent to crunchem hall because her parents dont like having her around she does her best to keep out of their way having adopted the local mobile library as her second home librarian mrs phelps sindhu vee has become a substitute mother as well as being a receptive audience for the stories spun by matildas fertile imagination the film is directed by matthew warchus who is the artistic director of the old vic in london and worked on the original stage production he has done a wonderful job transferring the musicals energy to the screen two hundred children were recruited to portray matildas schoolmates  or crunchems maggots as their headmistress refers to them  and their chorus work brings great vitality to tim minchins music and lyrics which are crucial in advancing the plot and crystallising the mood of the film theyre also gifted comedians adept at the slapstick that gives the choreography such charge eventually the maggots all learn how to stand up to the execrable trunchbull as does her sweetnatured underling miss honey lashana lynch despite his love of the sardonic dahl did believe in happy endings and dennis kellys script keeps the storys dark and light sides in perfect balance twelveyearold weir does the same its a performance in which innocence and intelligence are bound up with bravery and righteous anger you cheer her all the way as she takes on the seemingly impossible apparently a classic in the us the childrens book lyle lyle crocodile wasnt part of my childhood but will speck and josh gordons new adaptation a hybrid of live action and animation felt almost familiar  starting out as a homage to the great warner brothers cartoon one froggy evening then morphing into a bid to recreate the success of the genuinely charming paddington films canadian singer shawn mendes supplies the voice of lyle a shy but musically gifted young crocodile who is discovered hiding out in the attic of a new york brownstone by the family that has just moved in this is supposed to be an elevated childrens film meaning we get javier bardem as a flamboyant magician a suite of unmemorable songs from the team who worked on the greatest showman and adult swim comic brett gelman playing a nosy neighbour named mr grumps with hipster irony less ironised is the core message which appears to be the same one sometime pixar songwriter randy newman satirised long ago in his novelty hit simon smith and the amazing dancing bear even rank outsiders can be accepted anywhere provided they know how to sing and dance joel crawfords fully animated puss in boots the last wish has a few more things going for it at least for viewers like me who are easily won over by the notion of an intrepid marmalade cat whos voiced by antonio banderas and can buckle a swash with the best of them true i cant say i yearned to see this feline zorro undergo a midlife crisis and face his own mortality but given the character made his debut in shrek 2 in 2004 its understandable that weariness would start to set in having used up all but one of his nine lives puss in boots can only regain his mojo by embarking on a shamanistic spiritual quest through a psychedelic landscape where his fears manifest in physical form the painterly style influenced by anime makes a change from the usual photorealistic approach hot on his tail is a parade of villains including the menacing jack horner john mulaney and a cockney version of goldilocks florence pugh who has turned the three bears into her criminal sidekicks but still yearns for the day when everything will be just right there are a fair number of amusing moments along the way but also a few scenes that may alarm younger viewers one of these involving carnivorous flowers i found pretty creepy myself
