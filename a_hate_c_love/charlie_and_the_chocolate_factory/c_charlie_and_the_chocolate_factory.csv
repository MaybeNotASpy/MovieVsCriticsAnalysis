"Dec 27, 2023",positive," It’s been decades since I’ve read Roald Dahl’s 1964 children’s adventure novel “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.”  After seeing Timothée Chalamet in “Wonka,” I immediately went back to the 1971 “Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory” and then followed that with the 2005 “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.” Each movie employs music and has its own strengths. The title says it all. This is a story about Willy Wonka as seen through the eyes of Charlie. Rewatching this film in 2023, I was hit by a wave of sticky sweetness. I remembered my younger days when walking home meant passing first Farrell’s Ice Cream Parlour which had an old-fashioned style candy store and then half-way home, the mall that had Sears, which also a candy counter where candy could be measured out by the ounce. At the time of this film, there were about 120 Farrell’s nationwide. The original location closed in 2006 in Eugene, Oregon and the very last location to close was in Brea (8 June 2019). Like the Farrell’s Ice Cream Parlours, this “Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory” feels dated because of the clothing, technology and the film used. So this film might be best for younger children who won’t be critical of these aspects or adults who want to wallow in the nostalgia. Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum) is from a poor family who cannot afford the luxury of stepping into a candy store on his way home and buying sweets. The owner, Bill (Aubrey Woods), is a kindly man and he’s the one who sings “The Candy Man.” The small town is dominated by the Willy Wonka chocolate factory, but no one works there. A tinker (Peter Carell) explains to Charlie one evening that no one enters and no one leaves the factory. Charlie’s grandparents share a single bed and it’s his Grandpa Joe (Jack Albertson) who explains that Wonka was forced to close down his factory because some of his employees aided his competitors by stealing Wonka’s recipes. After laying off his entire workforce, and closing the gates of his factory, Wonka kept the gates closed, even three years later when the production mysteriously resumed. There’s considerable excitement generated worldwide when Wonka announces that he has hidden five Golden Tickets in chocolate Wonka Bars. The finders of the tickets will get a factory tour and a lifetime supply of chocolate. Almost immediately a sinister figure, Mr. Slugworth (Günter Meisner), is seen slithering around in the background.  Although the film shows places like Japan taking part of the buying pandemonium, the winners are a gluttonous German boy, Augustus Gloop (Michael Böllner); a spoiled daughter of a wealthy English father, Veruca Salta (John Dawn Cole) and two Americans–a gum-chewing champion, Violet Beauregarde (Denise Nickerson) and a television-obsessed boy, Mike Teevee (Paris Themmen) . Mr. Slugworth is seen whispering into the ears of each of the lucky ticket holders. Charlie only gets a chocolate bar on his birthday but is disappointed to find it doesn’t have the Golden Ticket. Grandpa Joe later takes him aside and gives him his tobacco money to use for another Wonka Bar, but the ticket isn’t in that bar either. Charlie gives up hope when news reports the fifth ticket was found in Paraguay. That fifth ticket in Paraguay turns out to be a forgery. Walking home, Charlie finds money in the future and buys a Wonka Bar and discovers the last ticket. Bill tells him to run home, before anyone can take it from him. At home, Charlie’s good luck inspires Grandpa Joe to jump out of bed for the first time in two decades. Charlie chooses hime to be his chaperone for the tour. Before the tour, Slugworth asks Charlie to get a sample of Wonka’s Everlasting Gobstopper, a candy for poor people that changes color and flavors, but never gets smaller or disappears. From the beginning, it is clear that Willy Wonka is a man of many surprises and not above some trickery. He is also a business man and requires that people on the tour sign a contract. The tour of the chocolate factory is filled with traps and mishaps and each of the children succumb to temptation, including Charlie and his grandfather. Yet unlike the others, Charlie and Grandpa are able to complete the tour.  Wonka reminds them that they didn’t follow the guidelines and lost their opportunity at a lifetime of chocolate. Although angry and disappointed, Charlie resists the temptation to give Slugworth the Gobstopper, proving himself worthy of inheriting the chocolate factory. Director Mel Stuart takes us on a wondrous journey, one that starts as relatable to kids growing up in a Farrell’s Ice Cream Parlour era and from there takes flight into a fantasy better than but not far removed from “Walt Disney’s Wonderful World of Color” (1961-1969) or “Disney’s Wonderful World (1979-1981). Wilder’s Willy Wonka is that favorite eccentric uncle who has some poignant story that he will not burden you with. He will pretend to be the responsible adult while watching other bratty kids make mistakes that will lead to hard life lessons. If you’re a good kid, he’ll lead you on grand adventures that you’ll relive as an adult, even if seeing through your adult eyes, he has grown more weary and less magical. Viewing this in 2023, the film seems a bit dated, so it is best for younger children or adults who want to wallow in whimsical nostalgia. Gene Wilder makes the mold for Wonka that is more approachable than Johnny Depp’s and allows for the possibility of Timothée Chalamet’s. “Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory” made its world premier 28 June 1971 in Chicago. The film is currently streaming on HBO Max. Although the Charlie has been put back in the title, this film really does hinge on Johnny Depp’s portrayal of the candy maker as well as the sensibilities of auteur filmmaker Tim Burton (working off of John August’s screenplay). This remains a musical fantasy, but none of the songs became major hits. In this film, Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) has an intact family. His father (Noah Taylor) had, until recently, worked at a toothpaste factory, but was replaced by a machine. His mother (Helena Bonham Carter) does the best she can. Grandpa Joe once worked at the Wonka factory, but it was closed due to industrial espionage. When the contest is announced, we meet the gluttonous Augustus Gloop, the spoiled Veruca Salt (Julie Winter), the competitive Violet Beauregarde (AnnaSophia Robb), the obnoxious Mike Tease (Jordan Fry) as well as their parents. This version stays closer to the children’s book, with Charlie and his grandfather finishing the tour without disobeying the rules. However, Wonka is given a lesson to learn when Charlie declines the opportunity to be Wonka’s heir since he’d have to give up his family. Wonka then loses creative focuses until, through Charlie, he is encouraged to visit his dentist father. They reconcile and Wonka learns that his father was secretly proud of him and had been following his career, clipping out articles. The entire Bucket family is then invited to live on the grounds of the factory. While the star of the 1971 film, Peter Ostrum, decided to leave acting (and take up veterinary science), this Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) is currently the lead of “The Good Doctor.” Fans of Burton won’t be disappointed. His people are always outsiders and a bit off the wall. If Gene Wilder’s Wonka was the eccentric uncle you who entertained and enchanted children, Johnny Depp’s Wonka was that weird uncle who was harmless, but slightly off in a way that made conversation or ordinary situations often awkward. Instead of a perfume of pensiveness like bittersweet chocolate that Wilder’s Wonka had, Depp’s Wonka was that weirdly white chocolate, creamy and almost chocolate, but not really what you have in mind when you want to eat chocolate and unpredictable in its actual sweetness. “Wonka” reminds us immediately of the Golden Ticket in the opening sequence, giving credit to the original author, before taking us through a pink haze to a small ship where up on the mast, our Willy Wonka (Timothée Chalamet ) sings, “It is time to bid the seven seas farewell. And the city I’ve pinned seven years of hopes on lies just over the horizon.” When we meet him, he’s wearing white-striped beige pants and a white long-sleeved shirt under a brown vest. The purple overcoat and top hat come soon enough, but they are tattered and his boots, he tells us, are leaky. He has spent all his money on his obsession with chocolate. The crew he leaved behind like him well enough, wishing him good luck and the color of his vest seems to have changed. He has only 12 silver sovereigns in his pocket. He’ll soon lose them all as he pursues his “hatful of dreams.” Yet that hat is magical as Mary Poppins carpetbag. You never know what he’ll be pulling out of it. His destination has a famous restaurant on every corner and a Galeries Gourmet. But he needs a place to stay and a suspicious person Bleacher (Tom Davis) who takes him to the boarding house of Mrs. Scrubitt (Olivia Colman). Despite being warned by an orphan girl named Noodle (Calah Lane) to read the small print, Wonka signs the ridiculously lengthy contract. The next day, Willy sells the Hoverchoc, floating chocolates that cause a person to levitate. He soon meets the leading chocolatiers: Arthur Slugworth (Paterson Joseph), Felix Fickelgruber (Mathew Baynton) and Gerald Prodnose (Matt Lucas)–all members of the Chocolate Cartel. The police are called and all of his earnings confiscated for “disrupting the trade of other businesses.” With only a sovereign left, he believes he can cover his room, but the small print charges him for everything, including uses the steps and the soap. He owes ten thousand sovereigns which with hard labor in the basement laundry will come to 27 years and 16 days. It’s not that he didn’t read the small print, Noodle quickly deduces, Wonka can’t read. Sent down the dirty laundry chute, Willy meets with the other unfortunates which include accountant Abacus Crunch (Jim Carter), plumber Piper Benz (Natasha Rothwell), a quiet woman named Lottie Bell (Rhakee Thakar) and comedian Larry Chucklesworth (Rich Fulcher).  We soon learn that the police are under the control of the cartel because the chief of police (Keegan-Michael Key) is addicted to chocolate and bribed with pricy bon tons. We do meet  an orange man with green hair, an Oompa Loompa named Lofty (because for his kind, he’s rather tall). Wonka stole cacao that Lofty (Hugh Grant) had been watching and now, by Lofty’s calculations, Wonka owes a chocolate debt that must be paid. First recruiting Noodle and then the rest of the laundry workers, Wonka begins selling his chocolate on the streets, trying to earn enough money to free them all. But the Chocolate Cartel has both the police chief and the head priest Father Julius (Rowan Atkinson) under the thrall of their chocolates and the cartel isn’t above murder. This is a children’s film so there will be no murders, even by chocolate. The film has a steampunk sensibility and while Chalet isn’t a dancer, the dancing numbers are still lovely enough. The costumes (by Lindy Hemming) are confectionary perfection. Chung-hoon Chung (“The Handmaiden,” 2016; “Oldboy,” 2003; and “Last Night in Soho,” 2021) casts an enchantment.  The screenplay by Paul King and Simon Farnaby is filled with whimsy and witty word turns. Wonka ask, “How to you like it? Dark, white nutty? Absolutely insane?” He gets arrested by “defying the laws of gravity” as well as “disrupting the trade of other businesses.” As director, King brings the right light touch and respects both the dancing, choreography and the dream. Timothy Chalamet’s vocals are pleasant enough. If Chalamet’s  Wonka was an uncle, he’d be the obsessive dreamer. Perhaps he wouldn’t be the uncle you’d ask to take your children to a dental appointment and you might not expect him to make the birthday party, but he’d bring a moment of magic into a child’s life. On the diversity score, Chalamet is part Jewish. Lane, Keegan-Michael Key, Paterson Joseph and Natasha Rothwell are  African American. British actress Rakhee Thakrar is of Asian Indian descent. If this fictional city was in Europe then one would perhaps expect more North Africans. As for Jason Acuña’s criticism of Grant’s casting, Oompa-Loompa’s were originally depicted as Black African pygmies. The pygmy people are ethnic groups who are of unusually short stature, but they are not people who have the medical condition of dwarfism, including proportionate dwarf. In the 1973 revised edition of “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,” the Oompa-Loompa’s were “long-haired, rosy-cheeked, and white, hailing from the island of Loompaland.” In the 1971 film, they became people with orange skin and green hair. Although Dahl was British, the original publication was the US edition in 1964 (illustrated by Joseph Schindelman). The first UK edition was in 1967 (illustrated by Faith Jaques). At that time, there weren’t many British actors who were short (I am 4ft 2in), so six of the actors were British and they used one Maltese actor, another from Turkey, one from Germany, and one woman. There were 10 of us in all. The director Mel Stuart sometimes got very frustrated telling us what to do in English and then trying to explain to the Maltese, German and Turkish actors what he wanted as well. Remember though, chocolate was originally found in the Americas and was only introduced to Europe in the 16th Century. Currently though the Ivory Coast leads in world production (38 percent) followed by Ghana and Indonesia (14 percent each). There are plenty of islands in Indonesia, but none with people who have orange skin and green hair. Maybe it’s the yeti sweat. This wonderfully whimsical film gives us a world of pure imagination where a man with a magical hat takes on a Chocolate cartel with new found friends. Take you kids or embrace your inner child and warm your cockles on this frothy fantasy. “Wonka” had its world premiere in London on 28 November 2023. It was released in the US on 8 December and in the US on 15 December 2023."

"Aug 19, 2023",positive," Though it’s tagged as a remake, Tim Burton returns to Roald Dahl’s original novel (and Dahl’s original title) for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005), the second cinematic take on the offbeat fantasy. Burton favorite Johnny Depp is downright odd (even for Depp) as the eccentric and reclusive chocolate mogul Willy Wonka, who has built his own private candy wonderland and shares it for one day with lucky kids who have found the golden tickets hidden in his Wonka Bars. Freddie Highmore (Depp’s co-star in Finding Neverland) is the plucky impoverished Charlie (he lives in a rickety home that looks like a melting gingerbread house) who becomes the heart that Wonka has lost in his isolation and Christopher Lee is Wonka’s dentist father, a character created specifically for the film. Burton feeds his creative sweet tooth with delicious art direction and imaginative creations and composer Danny Elfman writes a goofy set of pop tunes to Dahl’s original lyrics. But for all of the flights of fantasy, Burton never quite finds the heartbeat that warmed the original classic with Gene Wilder, partly because this Willy Wonka is so disconnected and distracted, unable to relate to anyone, and partly because the other characters who spiced the original movie are all undercooked here. But it is never less than enchanting and entertaining. David Kelly is Charlie’s Grandpa Joe, Helena Bonham Carter and Noah Taylor his smiling-through-the-storm parents, Annasophia Robb, Julia Winter, Jordon Fry, and Philip Wiegratz are the fellow ticket holders (Violet Beauregarde, Veruca Salt, Mike Teavee, and Augustus Gloop, respectively), Missi Pyle, James Fox, Adam Godley, and Franziska Troegner the parents, and Deep Roy is the Oompa Loompa workforce—every single singing-and-dancing one of them.

"Feb 3, 2020",positive,Marrying extreme set design and sublime casting... Burton's film showcases his usual interest in gothic effects and the original Willy Wonka's psychedelia.
"Nov 19, 2019",positive," Remakes can be a tricky thing, but director Tim Burton hits a bulls-eye with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, a delightful treat filled with stunning visuals and a lot of fun performances, headlined by Johnny Depp. In this retelling of the Roald Dahl novel, Depp plays the reclusive candy maker Willy Wonka. As the film opens, Wonka has decided to allow five children a chance to tour his chocolate factory by putting five golden tickets in his chocolate bars. One of the winners is Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore), who lives in a tilted shack with his grandparents and his mom and dad and spends most of his time dreaming about the candy his family usually is unable to afford. Charlie may well be the best-looking film I have seen this year thats even more visually appealing than the superb work by Robert Rodriguez in Sin City. Burtons direction is sharp and the movie is a feast for the eyes. With each scene, Burton gives audiences another piece of a unique world from the tilted house of the Buckets, to the many rooms the children discover inside the chocolate factory. There are still five months left in 2005, but Id be surprised if I see a movie more deserving of Oscars for visual effects and art direction. While the look of the film is the heart of Charlie, Depp and Highmore provide the movie with its soul. Depp has a lot of fun as Wonka. Some have suggested his performance mimics Michael Jackson, but I think it is much more original than that. Its delightful, yet creepy, and a performance that may top his goofy work in Pirates of the Caribbean. Charlie is sure to draw comparisons to the 1971 original starring Gene Wilder. As someone who only vaguely remembers seeing that film, its hard for me to compare it to this remake. I can compare Charlie to other 2005 releases though, and it is clearly one of this years most enjoyable. Ferrell plays Phil, a family man who has always been the whipping boy of his very competitive father (Robert Duvall). When Phil decides to coach his sons soccer team, the family competition heats up. It would be easy to see this as another Lady Bugs, the really bad soccer comedy with Rodney Dangerfield and Jackee, but there is a bit of heart in Kicking and Screaming, with Ferrell and Duvall both giving nice performances. Ferrell is capable of getting laughs even in bad films, but he gets some help here in an unlikely extended cameo by former Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka, who was a good enough sport to playfully poke fun at his tough-guy image. Sure, Kicking and Screaming is filled with obvious cliches, but director Jesse Dylan keeps the film moving along at a brisk enough pace that the flaws dont really matter."

"Mar 4, 2015",positive," THE BAND WAGON (1953). The 1931 Broadway revue The Band Wagon was the basis for director Vincente Minnelli's opulent MGM musical, for which the legendary writing team of Betty Comden and Adolph Green (Singin' in the Rain, On the Town) built a plot around the stage show's Howard Dietz-Arthur Schwartz songs and in the process made a film that's amusingly self-reflexive. While not as perceptive — or hilarious — as 1952's Singin' in the Rain in its skewering of backstage shenanigans among artists, it offers plenty of choice observations as it centers on has-been movie star Tony Hunter (Fred Astaire), who hopes his flagging fortunes will be salvaged by appearing in a lightweight Broadway musical written by his friends Lily and Lester Marton (Nanette Fabray and Oscar Levant). But problems materialize when the Martons select as their director Jeffrey Cordova (Jack Buchanan), a self-important blowhard who changes the Martons' frothy piece into a portentous reimagining of Faust. To further complicate matters, Cordova decides the leading lady should be ballet star Gabrielle Gerard (Cyd Charisse), whose classical training causes Tony to wonder whether their different styles will allow them to be compatible dancers. Buchanan easily steals the show as the pompous director, and key musical bits include the dreamy ""Dancing in the Dark,"" the amusing ""Triplets"" and the classic ""That's Entertainment,"" which was introduced in this film. This earned three Oscar nominations, including one for Comden and Green's screenplay. Blu-ray extras include audio commentary by Liza Minnelli (Vincente's daughter) and singer-musical archivist Michael Feinstein; a making-of featurette; the 1930 musical short Jack Buchanan with the Glee Quartet; and the theatrical trailer. The Band Wagon is available individually or as part of the Musicals Collection, a four-film set that also includes Singin' in the Rain, 1953's Kiss Me Kate in 2-D and 3-D versions, and 1953's Calamity Jane. CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY (2005). Forrest Gump's mama famously declared that ""Life is like a box of chocolates; you never know what you're going to get."" You never know what you're going to get with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, either, given that director Tim Burton tends to fluctuate between enfant terrible and rank sentimentalist. Coming off the forced whimsy of Big Fish, Burton was back on steadier ground, helming the second screen version of Roald Dahl's beloved novel. Johnny Depp headlines as Willy Wonka, the eccentric candymaker who allows five children to take a tour through his gargantuan factory. Young Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) is a perfect angel, but the other four kids prove to be such brats that they all eventually get their comeuppance within the walls of Wonka's candy-coated fortress. In some respects, this surpasses the previous screen incarnation, 1971's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (it's funnier and better paced). But Burton's maudlin streak gets the best of him via a needless back story that explains Wonka's affinity for candy, and this plot strand leads to a soggy finale that's easily bested by the final act of the '71 model. Depp, whose Wonka seems to be a cross between Michael Jackson and The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari's somnambulist Cesare, delivers an engaging surface performance, though I far prefer the more measured madness of Gene Wilder's interpretation. The 10th Anniversary Edition Blu-ray comes with a 28-page photo booklet and a letter from Burton. Extras include audio commentary by Burton; an immersive in-movie experience; a featurette on the Oompa-Loompas; and a piece on Dahl. DON'T LOOK NOW (1973). It's rare when a filmmaker helms one genuine masterpiece in his lifetime, let alone two (and consecutively!), yet that was the case when Nicolas Roeg followed 1971's Walkabout with another motion picture equally as brilliant. Based on a short story by Daphne du Maurier, the wordsmith whose works also fueled the Hitchcock classics Rebecca and The Birds, this stars Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland as Laura and John Baxter, a happily married couple who, reeling from the death of their daughter Christine, have temporarily settled in Venice so that John can assist in restoring an old church. Laura continues to drown in grief until she meets a pair of sisters (Hilary Mason and Clelia Matania), one of whom claims to be a psychic and informs her that Christine is happy in the afterlife but John is in danger. John believes it's all nonsense, even though he himself is blessed/cursed with a second sight he chooses to dismiss. But how to explain the strange visions he sees around him, including fleeting glimpses of a child wearing the same red raincoat donned by Christine when she died? The exquisite visual presentation — accentuated by Anthony Richmond's inspired lensing and Graeme Clifford's astute editing — allows this artistic endeavor to function as a mood piece, yet it's much more than that, thanks to its compelling plotline and heavy use of meaningful symbolism (with water, broken glass and the color red all receiving particularly vigorous workouts). A hit in its native England ever since its release, the picture is even more revered now: Separate polls by the British Film Institute and Time Out London have cited it as one of the 10 best British films ever made. No argument here. Blu-ray extras include both new and older interviews with many who worked on the movie, including Roeg, Christie, Sutherland, Richmond, Clifford, co-scripter Allan Scott and composer Pino Donaggio; the new piece Nicolas Roeg: The Enigma of Film, in which Oscar-winning directors Steven Soderbergh (Traffic) and Danny Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire) discuss Roeg's style and influence; and a 2003 Q&A session with Roeg. EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN (1994). Before he became an internationally renowned filmmaker and two-time Academy Award winner for Best Director (Brokeback Mountain, Life of Pi), Ang Lee was carving out a nice career in his native Taiwan. Two of his pictures, 1993's The Wedding Banquet and 1994's Eat Drink Man Woman, earned consecutive Best Foreign Language Film Oscar nominations, and both should have won against the underwhelming competition. That's especially true of Eat Drink Man Woman, a wise and touching piece that matches movies like Babette's Feast and Like Water for Chocolate in its depiction of food as a source of spiritual nourishment. Sihung Lung, so memorable as the father in The Wedding Banquet, here plays another parent, this one a culinary wizard who relates better to his dishes than to his three daughters: Jen (Kuei-Mei Yang), a schoolteacher still feeling the pain from a long-ago college relationship that ended badly; Kien (Chien-Lien Wu), a savvy businesswoman unable to find stability in her personal life; and Ning (Yu-Wen Wang), a perky fast-food employee who finds herself attracted to her best friend's boyfriend. The food on display will make mouths water, but don't assume this film is merely the cinematic equivalent of a high-end menu: The various relationships among the characters prove to be as intricate and delectable as the dishes, and the piece packs a potent emotional reach. FOXCATCHER (2014). With a tip of the hat in the direction of Langston Hughes, let it be noted that Foxcatcher isn't so much a study of a dream deferred but of the American Dream deferred. At heart a film about the awkward dance between the haves and have-nots — and, more specifically, a brutal condemnation of the barely masked disdain the one-percenters have for the other 99 — this true-life tale finds Steve Carell cast waaay against type as John du Pont, scion of one of the most prominent families in the nation. A meek and strange character charged with a patriotic zeal, John elects to use his vast fortune to build a team of world-class wrestlers. To anchor the group, he picks 1984 Olympic gold medalist Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum), an opportunity that seems like a godsend to the struggling athlete. But John's paranoid-schizophrenic nature soon gets the better of him, and he humiliates Mark by inviting his saintly older brother Dave (Mark Ruffalo), also an Olympic gold medalist, to take over as head of the team. From there, the tensions only mount, leading to a shocking crime that's unexpected but perhaps also unavoidable. As the rich nerd longing to be both an inspirational figure and just one of the guys (and perhaps be with the guys), Carell is scary-good, subjugating all traces of the familiar comic spark in evidence in his previous films. Ruffalo is effortlessly reassuring as the big brother who would be a benefit to any family, while Tatum reaches a new plateau as the troubled kid simply wanting life to give him a break. Like Carell, Tatum is required to suppress his natural charm — it's a knockout performance, fully in line with a movie that feels like a body slam to the mat. This earned five Oscar nominations, including bids for Carell and Ruffalo. LOVE AND DEATH (1975). ""If I could just see a miracle. Just one miracle. If I could see a burning bush, or the seas part, or my Uncle Sasha pick up a check."" ""I go [i.e. will be executed] at 6 o'clock tomorrow. I was supposed to go at 5 o'clock, but I have a smart lawyer. Got leniency."" Those are two of the great quips to be found in Woody Allen's Love and Death, but there's no use crying over spilled spoilers, since the picture is packed front to back with many more cheery bon mots — to say nothing of rollicking slapstick sequences, spoofy film homages and other modes of merriment guaranteed to keep viewers in perpetual guffaw. Using Russian literature as the base ingredient, Woody adds pinches of Ingmar Bergman, Sergei Eisenstein and Bob Hope to this yarn about lowly Boris Grushenko (Allen), a coward who finds himself an unwilling participant in the Napoleonic Wars. When he's not busy avoiding battlefield injury, he can be found wooing his distant cousin Sonja (Diane Keaton), who passes the time having affairs (when asked how many lovers she's had, she replies, ""In the midtown area?"") before she decides that she and Boris should attempt to assassinate Napoleon (James Tolkan). With Allen referencing everything from Bergman's The Seventh Seal to Dostoevsky's The Gambler, Love and Death might seem more haphazard than most of the auteur's films, but the astoundingly high hit-to-miss ratio deems it a keeper. This would be the last of what's commonly referred to as Allen's ""early, funny ones"" (to quote Stardust Memories), as his next picture, 1977's Annie Hall, would kick off a new chapter in his career. THE ST. VALENTINE'S DAY MASSACRE (1967). The great Roger Corman has produced 400 films (and still counting!) over the course of 60 remarkable years, and he's sat in the director's chair for 50 of those flicks. The St. Valentine's Day Massacre represents one of those occasions when he wore both hats; more significantly, it also marked the first time he worked in such lofty capacities for a major studio (in true Corman fashion, he wasn't thrilled with the lack of control and went back to making movies his way). His rat-tat-tat helming is one of the strengths of this crime flick, which uses documentary-style narration but exploitation-style violence to relate the events leading up to the notorious 1929 gangland slaying. The production values are top-notch, while the script by Howard Browne (an expert in the field who also penned 1961's Portrait of a Mobster, with Vic Morrow as Dutch Schultz, and 1975's Capone, starring Ben Gazzara as the title figure) hews to real-life events to an impressive degree. As for the supporting roster, it's peppered with familiar faces, including those belonging to Bruce Dern (poignant as a struggling mechanic), Joe Turkel (The Shining's bartender or Blade Runner's CEO, take your pick) and fantasy-film stalwart John Agar (Tarantula, The Mole People); there are even uncredited bits by Corman stableboys (and The Little Shop of Horrors stars) Jack Nicholson, Dick Miller and Jonathan Haze. What damages the picture are the performances by the two top-billed stars. Jason Robards handles the heavy lifting as Al Capone while George Segal provides the muscle as a giggly rival gunman (and he even smashes a sandwich in Jane Hale's face, aping James Cagney planting that grapefruit in Mae Clarke's kisser in 1931's The Public Enemy), but their hammy turns, more suited to Warren Beatty's cartoonish Dick Tracy than this Godfather precursor, strip the characters of any much-needed menace. WATERSHIP DOWN (1978). It's long been a matter of public record that the British ratings board received (and reportedly is still receiving) complaints for bestowing a kid-friendly rating on an animated feature that is most decidedly not for the kiddies (at least the very young 'uns). Based on Richard Adams' renowned novel, it centers on a group of rabbits who must find a new home after their warren is targeted for demolition by human builders. These bunnies, whose members include the heroic Hazel (voiced by John Hurt), the skittish Fiver (Richard Briers) and the burly Bigwig (Michael Graham-Cox), face peril every step of the way, whether it's from other rabbits (particularly the tyrannical Woundwart, played by Harry Andrews), other animals (a snarling dog, a sneaky cat) or various manmade instruments of pain (shotguns, snares). Like other enduring works of fiction such as George Orwell's Animal Farm and William Golding's Lord of the Flies, Adams' book is heavy on the allegory, and the film admirably retains much of this angle. But the pacing is flatly orchestrated by writer-director-producer Martin Rosen (in his directorial debut), and the animation style veers between poetic and prosaic. Despite an impressive roster of English actors handling vocal duties, the rabbits are absent of personality and therefore don't provide much in the way of a rooting interest. Zero Mostel provides the only comic relief as the bird Kehaar, although he tackles the role as if he were channeling the spirit of his The Producers co-star Kenneth Mars. The film's centerpiece song, the treacly ""Bright Eyes"" (sung by Art Garfunkel), was a smash hit across Europe but failed to crack the charts stateside. Blu-ray extras include an interview with Rosen; picture-in-picture storyboards for the entire film; and an interview with filmmaker Guillermo del Toro, a huge fan of the movie. WILD ORCHID (1990). While it hardly set the box office on fire, writer-director Zalman King's Wild Orchid could be considered the Fifty Shades of Grey of its day: a would-be erotic romp that ultimately carries as much of a sexual charge as a Chicken McNugget. Mickey Rourke, in the lengthy flame-out phase of his career, stars as James Wheeler, a wealthy businessman living in the picaresque city of Rio de Janeiro. Through a mutual friend (Jacqueline Bisset), he makes the acquaintance of visiting lawyer Emily Reed (Carré Otis), and it's not long before Emily's under his spell and privy to his mind games and dominant behavior. As scripter, King also had a hand in 1986's equally risible Nine 1/2 Weeks (also starring Rourke), but that picture at least had the benefit of an excellent central performance by Kim Basinger. Otis, on the other hand, is particularly dreadful, displaying about as much acting talent as an avocado. As for Rourke, his sleepy-eyed performance leads one to believe that all Wheeler really wants out of life is a good night's sleep. The film achieved a small measure of media notoriety back in 1990, first when it had to be trimmed to garner an R rating rather than an X (the more explicit version has long been available on home video, but this new Olive Films Blu-ray release only contains the theatrical R-rated cut), and later when the rumors wouldn't cease regarding the contention that the on-screen sex between then-couple Rourke and Otis wasn't simulated and the couple really ""did it."" To which a nation collectively shrugged and muttered, ""Who cares?"""

"Jun 13, 2008",positive," And so the latest movie remake slides, sugar-frosted, off the production line and into the waiting hands of a viewing public ready to gobble up anything as long as it has a soft centre. Gene Wilder, as the wacky confectioner of the original Seventies adaptation, was the best thing about that particular film, which lacked pace and foundered on the shores of bad child acting. His position is in no danger from Johnny Depp. You know the drill - or, if you've read the book, you probably think you do. Charlie Bucket is a poor lad, big in heart but low on funds, who lives with his family in the ramshackle part of town. Mind you, despite their abject poverty and unremitting diet of cabbage soup, they still manage to have a colour telly. Really, Tim? Weird old Willy Wonka, who owns the nearby chocolate factory, hasn't been seen for years until, out of the blue, he announces that he's hidden five golden tickets in his choccie bars, so that five lucky little 'uns can pay him a visit. Needless to say, in the way of good fairytales, four of the five are no-good brats, while Charlie's light shines out like a beacon in the night. There are quite a lot of good things about this production, in addition to a series of impressive industrial accidents. The set design, as you would expect from a Burton film, is superlative, with the streets where the Buckets live suitably atmospheric and cold. The characterisation is good, too - Mike Teavee (Jordan Fry) beautifully evil as the computer game crazed kid, Charlie (Freddie Highmore) believable, yet not-too-sugary, and Grandpa Joe (David Kelly, fighting a little too hard to make sure his Irish accent doesn't escape) equally so as the oldster who never grew up. The film falls down with the Oompa Loompas (all played by Deep Roy). That isn't a bad idea, but the Busby Berkeley and rap take on their songs doesn't really work. Roald Dahl's lyrics are lost in a heady rush of candyfloss effects. However, where the film fails most is with Wonka himself. Depp has passed over weird in favour of downright creepy. He really doesn't feel in keeping with the book at all, as he is quirky without being ""fun"". Also, the character lacks depth, compared to his previous manifestation, which is odd, because here he has been shackled with an unnecessary back-story that clumsily tries to make excuses for his weirdness. Dad was a dentist. Willie's teeth were wired and... oh, you really don't want to know. If it weren't for the back-story and Hollywood's need to add that extra bit of sugar coating, this could have been a Fudgemallow Delight of a movie. Instead, its centre is just a bit too squishy."
"Jan 15, 2008",positive," A deliciously entertaining treat, Tim Burton delivers his best work in years with his darkly comic and yet family friendly take on the classic children’s tale of a certain poor young boy and an eccentric chocolate factory owner. Roald Dahl’s novel has been adapted once before into a 1971 Gene Wilder kids film which has a large and loyal following. Dahl himself however hated it, and fans of the original story were understandably upset about how it not only made major changes, but was so saccharinely sweet that it rotted your teeth just looking at it. Burton’s film by contrast is far closer in tone and detail with Dahl’s writing which was able to combine some pretty dark and adult themes into a wildly imaginative yet deceptively simple moral fable. Utilising both some truly astounding production design, a strong cast and even some new back story to flesh out Willy Wonka himself – the result is something that’s both esoteric and dark in that definitively Tim Burton style and yet bright, cheery and deliciously mainstream in a way that works on levels that kids will appreciate and adults will enjoy. Its a tricky tale but one that’s beautifully optimistic enough to warm the heart of most pessimists, but only rarely delving into the sentimental so as not to disengage them. Leading the charge is Depp’s take on the character of Willy Wonka. Instead of Gene Wilder’s wild mood swinging father figure, Depp opts to play Wonka more like a misfit who’s grown up in his own reality. With his white face, perfect teeth and flashy clothing, the comparison of Depp’s Wonka with Michael Jackson is somewhat fair with some strikingly similar moments and mannerisms. However there’s significant differences – whereas Jacko loves the children, Wonka has an almost inherit repulsion to them – he’s not a man trying to recapture his youth but rather escape it, and the child-like qualities stem from a rebellion to his overly disciplinary dentist father (Christopher Lee). Depp makes Wonka both creepy and by contrast sympathetic with unexpected but funny non sequiturs pouring from his mouth at regular intervals. What’s much stronger than the 70’s film this time around is the supporting cast. A fresh faced Highmore gives a surprising weight and believability to his role of the kid who can’t seem to see the bad in people – he’s so good he almost wipes the memory of that horrid child actor from the old film away. Likewise all the kids, the various parents (Missi Pyle and James Fox have great turns as an over achieving Barbie doll mother and a classy stolid millionaire father respectively) and the multiple turns by Deep Roy as the multi-costumed Oompa Loompas are great and fit perfectly into the unfolding action. Burton has delicious fun with the assorted Oompa Loompa numbers which spoof all sorts of things from “Psycho” to the Beatles and whilst a little cutesy, they are great show stoppers that are short and very different in styles. The factory itself is astonishing. Admittedly the CG at times such as the glass elevator are all too obvious, but other tricks ranging from the set enhancements to the Oompa Loompa size variations are flawless. The sets are an effect in themselves with giant chocolate waterfalls and Indian palaces, sugary candy trees and giant pink boats rushing headlong down neon-coloured rapid rides. The only real downside with the film is the tale is so inherently known that it does follow a predictable and tired path. Even those who’ve escaped familiarity with the story will easily recognise the way its headed (each child undone by their blatant character flaw) and how things will end up. Its not the goal though that’s what’s fun here but the journey, and what a journey it is. Indeed the factory is so fantastical that the early and post-visit scenes seem sadly on the dull side in comparison and drag on a little long. Other thematic elements evoke Burton’s previous work ranging from “Edward Scissorhands” to “Big Fish”. Most of all though is the off beat tone which some will find too eccentric whilst others will say it doesn’t got far enough. What’s going to be interesting here is how people react to a film like this. The upbeat and innocent 1939 classic film adaptation of L. Frank Baum’s “The Wizard of Oz” is how most people know that story, but fans of the L. Frank Baum original novels (and the animated early 90’s incarnation) know of it as a slightly darker, more complex and adult fantasy. Likewise the 70’s ‘Wonka’ film is the only way a lot of people know this story, but this “Charlie” is much more of a direct adaptation of Dahl’s similarly dark and more grown up novels. Its the same inherit story but each is quite different in their approaches and so, like sweets, which one you prefer is a matter of taste. This take on “Charlie” however I found the sweetest of all, one of the best family films in a while and one of the year’s stronger films to date."
"Sep 24, 2007",positive," I’ll bet there are many adults today who have queasy memories of 1971’s Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Psychedelic yet moralistic, the movie offered Gene Wilder in his full passive-aggressive efflorescence as the mysterious chocolatier Willy Wonka, whose gentle demeanor cloaked what appeared to be a deep contempt for children, his most loyal clientele. It also had ghastly songs (without this movie, Sammy Davis Jr. wouldn’t have inflicted “The Candy Man” on telethon viewers year after year), those obnoxious Oompa Loompas, and colorful but indifferent direction by Mel Stuart. If anyone feels any sort of residual fondness for it, it’s because that malicious fantasist Roald Dahl, in his original book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, devised such a ready-made fantasy concept: five children invited to spend a day in the world’s largest choccy emporium. Remakes generally depress me as much as they do anyone else, but Tim Burton’s Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is poised to become a new cult classic to replace the old one. Burton understands this story in a way few other directors could (although Danny DeVito, who did a rascally job with Dahl’s Matilda, might also have had fun with the project). This director constantly veers from mopiness to flamboyant glee, though Charlie is closer in tone to his Beetlejuice than to his Edward Scissorhands. Once again, Burton has Johnny Depp along for the ride, and though many have said that Depp has based his Willy Wonka on Michael Jackson, I suspect he’s really playing the only person he ever plays in Tim Burton films — Tim Burton. This Wonka is a misfit who enjoys showing off his elaborately designed playpen but isn’t much fazed by those who don’t appreciate it. As in all other versions, the hero is Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore), who lives in a broken-down house with his poverty-level family. Burton, however, takes the pathos out of Charlie’s situation by giving him a house right out of German expressionism — the entire doorway leans inward, for instance. Charlie is one of the five kids who discover a Golden Ticket inside a Wonka candy bar — a ticket to a day inside the elusive Wonka’s factory. The other kids are brats who each illustrate a childish trait that Dahl hated: gluttonous Augustus Gloop, gum-chewing Violet Beauregarde, cathode-mesmerized Mike Teavee (whose fixation has been updated to videogames), and, worst of all, spoiled rich girl Veruca Salt, whose attitude is so rotten that a rock band named themselves after her. Their punishments, as before, fit their crimes, though one wonders what exactly Roald Dahl had against gum-chewing. Instead of sappy Anthony Newley songs, this movie has Danny Elfman scoring the original lyrics from Dahl’s book; there’s no brain-searing “Oompa Loompa doompadee doo” song here. The Oompa Loompas are all played (via digital replication) by the diminutive Indian actor Deep Roy, whose unsmiling and uncute persona here is both refreshing and consistently funny. The sets are, of course, obvious sets, but they always are in Tim Burton’s films; the nasty bits (claustrophobes will, as ever, have a hard time with Augustus Gloop’s fate) are softened by Burton’s jaunty sense of artifice. Gene Wilder can criticize this remake all he wants — Burton and Depp have simply done it better. I have mixed feelings about a backstory added by scripter John August, in which the young Wonka’s fascination with sweets is neatly tied to his forbidding dentist dad. It adds little to the story except for a lame coda in which Wonka, having learned the power of family, reunites with his dad; however, since the father is played by Christopher Lee — still going strong at 83, Hammer bless him — I’ll forgive it. This Factory, genuinely beautiful and imaginative, is the movie that admirers of the original Factory (who haven’t seen it since they were kids) carry around in their heads. And it adds another lovable freak to the Burton/Depp gallery, perhaps the freakiest of all. Even without the Jacko undertones some viewers see in it, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is the most truly subversive entertainment for kids since … well, since Roald Dahl stopped writing. I can swallow Tim Burton making it, that’s fine. It’s everything else that I hate. # 1 being Johnny Depp. He’s so overly cartoony and childishly creepy. He’s so pale he practically glows, he’s glasses hide is eyes, hiding part of himself, and he smile is some creepy plastered on appliance, and is voice is a joke. Gene Wilder gave a genuine kindness to a character that could seem harsh with the children. And his singing was wonderful and almost calming. While the children in the original are annoying they super dosed these kids with stupid juice for the modern times. And while the Ooompa loompas of the original all had their different shapes, sizes and expressions, they just gave the roll to one creepy guy and made stupid fake copies of him everywhere, like a cop out. I’m sure I’d have more complaints but I could only manage to suffer throught it once. I think this movie should never have existed and should be made to dissapear completely. And I see no positive comparison between this and the original."
"Sep 20, 2007",positive," “There is no place I know to compare with pure imagination.” Gene Wilder sang that dreamy refrain when he played Willy Wonka, the candy-making madman in the beloved but creepy 1971 film Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, based on Roald Dahl’s book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. That famous song would fit in beautifully with director Tim Burton’s “take two” of Dahl’s whimsical adventure. Burton turns the story into an explosion of “pure imagination.” In fact, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is so alive with visual invention that some critics are saying there’s too much imagination on screen. It’s becoming more and more clear that Burton, despite his fetish for the phantasmagoric, is not so much a storyteller as a stylist. And Charlie gives him a big, bold framework across which he can drape his latest outrageous decorations. It’s a challenge to take a story about people who do little more than tour a building and turn it into something consistently entertaining. But Burton’s done it, and better than it was done in 1971. It has some moments that teeter on the edge of tedium, as Wonka guides his admiring guests around and explains his whimsical inventions to them. But the effects are a hoot. The casting ranges from good to brilliant… especially David Kelly as Grandpa Joe and Freddie Highmore as Charlie. Deep Roy deserves some kind of award for what must have been a trying role, performing all of the necessary Oompa Loompa tasks. Perhaps the biggest surprise of all is that the film is as good when Depp leaves the screen as it is when he’s on it. In fact, the opening scenes in Charlie’s ramshackle home are fantastic. And Johnny Depp, while a far cry from Dahl’s version of Wonka, creates another entirely unique character. His version of Wonka struck me as just as a man who never matured past the point of the fractured child he was when he ran away from home. Given the new back-story Burton’s invented for him, that makes sense. Personally, I’ve never been convinced that Dahl gave us enough story to fill out the frame of a fully satisfying feature film. Thus, I don’t mind Burton’s embellishments on the life of young Willy Wonka so much. I think Burton makes it pretty clear, right up front, that this is a sort of thematic sequel to Edward Scissorhands — the first time we see Depp turn and face the camera, he’s wielding a pair of scissors. Like Edward, Wonka lives in a castle on a hill. But unlike Edward, Wonka’s doesn’t have a benevolent bone in his body. He’s the American dreamer… self-indulgent, pursuing only his own appetites, like the beastly children who abuse his generous offer of a tour. He finds, in the end, that even though he never had a loving family of his own, his only route to happiness is to find one… and to deal gracefully and forgivingly with the unfortunate damage that’s been done to him. Sure, this is a whole new lesson for the Wonka story, but it’s not a bad one at all. In fact, it’s a revision of the lesson of Burton’s last film, Big Fish. That film ended by justifying the self-indulgence of its central character, saying it’s alright to escape into irresponsible fantasies, even if you hurt those around you, because fantasy will earn you immortality. Burton’s Chocolate Factory suggests that sometimes our fantasies can turn us into selfish fools; sometimes its better to make room for some reality; sometimes we should pursue not what we want, but what we need. I feel compelled to add that I’m pleased with the film’s emphasis on the link between parental irresponsibility and damaged child psyches. No, the movie is in no way subtle about this point, but that’s forgivable considering the cartoonish nature of this adaptation, in which everything is exaggerated. To exaggerate a phrase from Flannery O’Connor: Sometimes a deaf culture needs to have its head stuffed into a megaphone while someone shouts the truth through it."
"Jul 14, 2007",neutral,"Depp's Wonka exudes none of the gravity required for the role. It's as though he didn't take the role seriously. Rather than an intimidating candyman teaching brats a lesson, this Wonka is simply a freak."

"Mar 1, 2007",negative,"There's a lot of cool stuff on display here, but it lacks the consistent creative vision--or, if you like, the pure imagination--of the original film."
"Oct 21, 2006",positive," First things first: Tim Burton's 2005 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is not a remake of Mel Stuart's beloved 1971 Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Comparisons between the two adaptations of Roald Dahl's classic children's book are inescapable (and actually rather interesting), but each deserves to be judged on its own merits, since each is successful and enchanting in its own right. When rumors of a new version of Dahl's tale about poor Charlie Bucket and his Golden Ticket-worthy adventures inside the mysterious realm of enigmatic candy man Willy Wonka first started circulating, fans of the first film were rightfully skeptical. Who could possibly live up to Gene Wilder's career-defining performance as the cheerfully cracked chocolate czar? Certainly not Robin Williams, Jim Carrey, or Nicolas Cage, all of whom were in the running for the role at one time. Ultimately, Burton — who made a repeated point of saying that Dahl's book was his only inspiration — decided that Wonka's trademark frock coat and top hat were best suited to frequent collaborator Johnny Depp. And Depp, as is his wont, stepped up and made the part completely his own. Sporting a Prince Valiant bob and a pale complexion that has the greenish hue of a true shut-in, the erstwhile Captain Jack Sparrow turns Wonka into a fey, chipper, mercurial man who's really just an overgrown child himself. His high-pitched voice, clipped speech, and cockeyed enthusiasm are more reminiscent of Depp's turn as B-movie auteur Ed Wood than they are of pop star Michael Jackson (as some have suggested). Burton's most significant deviation from Dahl's book is to give Wonka a back-story that explains some of his arrested development and emotional instability; it's not really necessary — part of Wonka's appeal as a character is his mystery — but since it doesn't slow down the main action too much, it's forgivable. The rest of the plot follows the source material very closely: Sweet-natured Charlie Bucket (the talented Freddie Highmore, who also worked with Depp in Finding Neverland) lives in a rickety shack with his parents (Helena Bonham-Carter and Noah Taylor) and four grandparents in a bleakly anonymous town where the skyline is dominated by the smokestack of Wonka's factory. When the notorious recluse announces that five lucky children who find Golden Tickets he's hidden inside his chocolate bars will get to come inside for a tour, the race is on. After Charlie finds the last ticket, he and Grandpa Joe (the perfectly cast David Kelly) queue up with greedy Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegratz), selfish Veruca Salt (Julia Winter), competitive Violet Beauregarde (Annasophia Robb), and videogame-addicted Mike Teavee (Jordan Fry). Once they pass through the factory gates, they discover a fantastical world filled with delights (the chocolate room, Wonka's Oompa Loompas) and dangers (experimental chewing gum, a roomful of nut-testing squirrels). Burton delivers it all in style: The 1971 film was an imaginative visual treat, but effects technology has come a long way in the last three decades, and it shows (the squirrels are particularly impressive). And when digital magic meets creative, compelling storytelling — as it does here — the result is a ""reimagining"" that any Dahl fan should savor. One of Burton's most unusual (and rewarding) ideas was to have a single person, Deep Roy, play all of Wonka's Oompa Loompa workers. The actor is put through the paces in composer Danny Elfman's four big musical numbers, each of which is done in a different style, from Bollywood to '70s pyschedelia."

"Jul 30, 2005",neutral," Everyone knows the story: reclusive candy man Willy Wonka will be opening the doors of his factory for the five lucky children who find a golden ticket inside one of his chocolate bars. As Wonkamania spreads throughout the world and candy bars are snapped up by the truckload, poor little Charlie Bucket dreams of being able to afford just one. He lives with his parents and four bedridden grandparents in a ramshackle hut in the shadow of Wonka’s factory, with holes in the roof and cabbage soup for dinner.  
One by one, the tickets are found around the world by a succession of undeserving children: Augustus Gloop (Wiegratz), the German glutton who celebrates finding the ticket by eating even more chocolate ; Violet Beauregarde (Robb), the world gum chewing champion (and now martial arts expert, for some reason) ; Veruca Salt (Winter), the spoiled rotten brat with the rich daddy ; and Mike Teavee (Fry), the kid who spends his entire life in front of a TV screen.  
Charlie knows that his chances of finding a ticket are almost impossible, but with the love and support of his family he never gives up hope. Even as the fifth ticket is found and just as quickly declared a hoax, Charlie finds some money in the street and decides to use it to buy one last Wonka bar. It shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone that he buys the bar containing the last golden ticket and so turns up at Wonka’s factory along with his Grandpa Joe (Kelly), the rest of the winning kids and their parents to claim their prize – a tour of the factory and a lifetime’s supply of chocolate, plus a special additional prize that only one of the children will receive.  
As far as changes to the source material goes, I’m afraid it’s been at least twenty years since I read Roald Dahl’s book, so any point of reference has to be the 1971 filmed version that, notwithstanding a rather dull first half hour, remains a magical experience, anchored by a mesmerising Gene Wilder. Existing in the same is-it-England, is-it-America, is-it-Switzerland world, Burton’s rendering follows it fairly closely in its mid-section, while going off in slightly different directions during the build up and finale.  
Dahl’s moral is still intact, even if – as seems to be the way of things these days – it is hammered into us from early in the film. But gone now is the gleefully sadistic edge. Yes, the rotten kids still get their comeuppance, but great pains are made to ensure the audience knows that they didn’t come to any permanent harm. Contrast this with the original where, for all you knew, they did end up in the incinerator. Design wise it’s appealing but not breathtaking, with the subtler external CG shots of the factory and the Bucket home if anything more impressive than the bold and colourful, but sometimes ordinary, interiors.  
Where Charlie and the Chocolate Factory really suffers is in Burton’s direction. He seems to have lost the ability to make a film with any semblance of narrative flow. There’s no energy, no sugar rush, merely a linear procession from room to room, contraption to contraption (in fairness, a criticism that can occasionally be levelled at the original). The excising of the Slugworth subplot means we stumble towards one enormous anticlimax, only to be forced to endure a laboured and unnecessary final reel that’s the cinematic equivalent of pulling teeth.  
Then there’s the vital central element of Willy Wonka. Whereas Wilder made him a mischievous eccentric who could occasionally become unhinged, Depp plays him as a genuinely freaky manchild with an obvious disdain for any sort of human contact, and not just with children – his distrust of parental figures is illustrated in a series of flashbacks to his childhood, where his dentist father (Lee) practically brainwashes him on the evil of sweeties. It’s not a bad performance, just a really, really odd one that does nothing to make the character interesting or likeable.  
Elsewhere, Highmore is perfect as Charlie, cute without being cloying and able to gain the sympathy of the audience from the outset. The rest of the kids are ideally cast for their particular roles and are quite good fun. Kelly barely registers as Grandpa Joe, particularly once we get to the factory where he disappears into the background along with everybody else, and there’s little sense of the bond he’s supposed to share with Charlie that was so evident with Jack Albertson.  
Tim Burton’s Charlie and the Chocolate Factory should have been a magical mystery tour, full of sparkle and invention. Instead, a leaden pace, a lack of wit and one sorely misjudged performance have infused it with all the fun of a broken down carnival ride."

"Jul 25, 2005",positive," Tim Burton's first (and best) movie, Pee-wee's Big Adventure follows Paul Reubens' childlike title character as he embarks on a quest to find his stolen bicycle. It's clear virtually from the word go that Pee-wee's Big Adventure is the sort of film that one either loves or hates, as  Burton, working from Phil Hartman, Michael Varhol, and Reubens' script, employs a seriously (and unapologetically) broad directorial sensibility that's reflected in the movie's various attributes - from Danny Elfman's irresistibly larger-than-life score to David L. Snyder's eye-popping set design to Reubens' less-than-subtle (yet always engrossing) turn as the cartoonish protagonist. The latter's consistently affable performance plays a pivotal role in cementing Pee-wee's Big Adventure's success, to be sure, as the actor steps into the shoes of his almost unreasonably likable character to an extent that's nothing short of hypnotic - with Reubens' stellar work heightened by an eclectic supporting cast that includes Elizabeth Daily, Mark Holton, and Judd Omen. And while the episodic screenplay admittedly does result in a very small handful of narrative lulls (eg there's probably one too many dream sequences here), Pee-wee's Big Adventure closes with a series of immensely captivating sequences that ensure it ends on as positive a note as one could envision - with the perpetually amiable atmosphere confirming the movie's place as a delight that holds appeal for all ages. Quite possibly the most bizarre and flat-out surreal effort of Tim Burton's career, Beetle Juice details the post-death exploits of happily-married couple Adam (Alec Baldwin) and Barbara (Geena Davis) - with the majority of the proceedings devoted to their efforts at scaring away the new family that's moved into their expansive home. Though his character provides the film's title, Michael Keaton's Beetlejuice remains a surprisingly periphery figure for the majority of Beetle Juice's run-time - with Burton instead using Adam and Barbara's oddball shenanigans as a springboard for a series of thoroughly creative set-pieces and interludes. The inevitable realization that Michael McDowell and Warren Skaaren's screenplay isn't actually about anything is subsequently not nearly as problematic as one might've feared, as Burton has - along with production designer Bo Welch and composer Danny Elfman - infused the movie with a funhouse-like sensibility that proves instrumental in capturing (and sustaining) the viewer's enduring interest. And while there are admittedly a few lulls within the narrative, the consistent inclusion of eye-popping sequences - ie the infamous ""Day-O"" musical number, a confrontation with an enormous sandworm, etc - does assure that such instances of downtime are often short lived and easy to overlook. Keaton's scene-stealing performance remains an obvious highlight, yet it's hard to deny the effectiveness of the supporting cast's uniformly strong work (in addition to Baldwin and Davis, the movie boasts appearances from Jeffrey Jones, Sylvia Sidney, and Winona Ryder) - with the end result an unapologetically silly and endlessly inventive exercise in style. It is, unfortunately, awfully difficult to revisit Tim Burton's Batman with an impartial eye in the wake of Christopher Nolan's genre-defining Dark Knight trilogy, as the film, viewed in that light, can't help but come off as underwhelming and overly cartoonish by comparison - which is too bad, certainly, given that there are still plenty of elements here that absolutely enthrall (including Michael Keaton's tremendously entertaining turn as Bruce Wayne/Batman). But the movie, which unfolds at a pace that often feels much more deliberate than necessary, is never quite able to make the leap from mildly amusing to flat-out engrossing, with Burton's curiously subdued sensibilities playing a key role in perpetuating the film's erratic, uninvolving atmosphere (ie the film, though suffused with larger-than-life characters and visuals, mostly plays like a somber drama). The compelling-yet-rarely-captivating vibe prevents the viewer from wholeheartedly connecting to either the characters or the storyline, with the transformation of Jack Nicholson's Jack Napier into the Joker faring especially poorly - as Nicholson, though quite good here, never quite manages to make the role his own as Heath Ledger did in 2008's The Dark Knight (ie it often feels as though Nicholson is just riffing on Cesar Romero's take from the campy '60s television series). There's so much here that works - Danny Elfman's iconic score, Anton Furst's gothic production design, etc - that Batman's inability to take flight, so to speak, is nothing short of baffling, as it's clear that the film, watchable as it may be, could (and should) be so much better.  Planet of the Apes casts Mark Wahlberg as Leo Davidson, a cocky pilot who, through a series of bizarre incidences, finds himself thrust into a world where intelligent simians rule. The humans have been relegated to slavery, used as bartering chips among the apes. Being the headstrong soldier that he is, Davidson is not content to just sit around and do the bidding of a bunch of monkeys, so he sets out to escape his captors and make it back to his ship - where he'll hopefully be able to fly away from this planet of the apes. Along the way, he befriends two women - one an ape and one a human - and incurs the wrath of a vengeful chimp named General Thade (played with over-the-top glee by Tim Roth). Planet of the Apes bears little resemblance to the Charlton Heston flick that inspired it, as the film generally plays out as more of an action movie than a drama. And oddly enough, some of the more compelling characters in the movie are under a few coats of ape make-up. As one of the few humans, Mark Wahlberg has an unenviable job - he has to try and make an impression while standing next to remarkably lifelike apes, monkeys, and orangutans. And he's good, though in a bland sort of way. It's the many actors trapped inside ape costumes that steal the show, particularly Paul Giamatti as Limbo.  If there's a fault to this otherwise consistently entertaining flick, it's a truly bizarre ending that leaves a horrible aftertaste. Twist endings are good, provided they make sense. Twist endings simply for the sake of twist endings are bad, and that's what we've got here. Burton should have just left well enough alone and either ended the flick after that last battle, or copied that oft-imitated conclusion from the original. Anything but this nonsensical ending that we're stuck with. Planet of the Apes is summer entertainment done right. With a top-notch director and some amazing visual effects, it's certainly one of the most entertaining check-your-brain-at-the-door flicks in recent years. Though it's not quite his best work (that remains Pee-Wee's Big Adventure), Big Fish does mark Tim Burton's most accomplished and (for lack of a better word) grown-up movie to date. And after the unapologetically mainstream Planet of the Apes, Big Fish returns Burton to his quirky and more character driven roots. Told largely in flashback, the film stars Billy Crudup as a successful young man named Will Bloom. Will's never had a very good relationship with this father, Edward (Albert Finney), a gregarious Southerner with a penchant for tall tales. But given that Edward is on his deathbed, Will finds that he has to try and connect with his dad before he passes away. Meanwhile, the various stories that Edward's been telling his whole life unfold before our eyes, with Ewan McGregor appearing as the younger Edward. Big Fish is expansive yet intimate, with detailed portraits of various characters occurring over some of the most visually interesting sets to come around in a while. From the bizarre town of Spectre (in which the roads are covered in grass) to the circus that employs Edward, the film is a continual delight on a visceral level and there's  no mistaking Burton's unique touch. And as one would expect from a Burton flick, he's included a roster of actors that's just about perfect. Though most of McGregor's scenes take place in the fantasy land of Edward's imagination, the actor imbues the character with a definite sense of realism; he never goes over the top, which must have been a temptation (especially when you're consorting with a literal giant). Not surprisingly, Edward's been surrounded by a variety of eccentric characters - including the aforementioned giant, who actually turns out to be a fairly compelling figure (as played by Matthew McGrory, the man never becomes a cliché). Familiar faces like Danny DeVito and Steve Buscemi pop up in supporting roles, which just adds to the atmosphere of fun. But the film also spends a good deal of time in the present, as Will attempts to get to know the real Edward. Crudup, in one of his rare ""normal guy"" roles, does a superb job of playing this man that clearly loves his father but has grown tired of his neverending stories. It's Will's relationship with Edward that provides the film with its emotional core, which proves to be downright touching by the time everything is said and done. And that's what makes Big Fish as special as it is. The fantastical elements in the film ensure that it remains entertaining throughout, but it's the reality of the characters that makes the movie more than just a visual treat. By the time the end credits roll around, there's a distinct possibility that male audience members will find themselves shedding a tear or two. Big Fish is one of those films that deals with the relationship between a father and his son, and (like Frequency and Field of Dreams before it) packs an emotional wallop to which most men will easily be able to relate. Big Fish is a real achievement from one of Hollywood's most underrated directors. Don't miss it. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory marks Tim Burton's second remake (following Planet of the Apes), and to call this an improvement is quite an understatement. Burton's only goal this time around is to entertain, and on that level, he undoubtedly succeeds. The film is set in some bizarre amalgam of various time periods, where women dress like it's the '40s, kids play modern video games, and blue collar workers have begun losing jobs to machines. Our hero is Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore), one of five children that wins a chance to visit Willy Wonka's (Johnny Depp) legendary candy factory. Leading the tour is, of course, Willy Wonka himself - who takes the kids all around his larger-then-life plant, and introduces them to the fabled Oompa Loompas (all of whom are portrayed by one man, Deep Roy). It's impossible to talk about Charlie and the Chocolate Factory without mentioning Depp's odd performance (odd even by his standards), which will undoubtedly divide audiences. There's absolutely nothing warm and fuzzy about this guy; he seems to actively dislike these kids and their parents, to the extent that it's difficult to imagine why Wonka would invite all these people into his factory (we learn the necessity behind the invitation as the film progresses). In that respect, the film offers up an explanation behind Wonka's anti-social tendencies in the form of flashbacks revolving around his relationship with his cruel father (played by Christopher Lee). But there's absolutely no denying the fact that - along with Burton's expectedly loopy sense of style and Danny Elfman's quirky score - it's Depp who keeps things interesting throughout, if only to see what he'll say or do next. Based on Stephen Sondheim's 1979 musical, Sweeney Todd casts Johnny Depp as Benjamin Barker - a barber whose efforts at exacting revenge against those who wronged him are sidetracked by his participation in a profitable (and grisly) meat-pie business with neighbor Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter). While there's certainly no shortage of positive attributes within Sweeney Todd - including Tim Burton's expectedly grandiose directorial choices and Depp's wonderfully entertaining performance - the film suffers from a relentless emphasis on bland, thoroughly forgettable musical numbers whose sameness inevitably lends the proceedings a distinctly oppressive quality. And although there are a few admittedly memorable songs sprinkled here and there - ie ""My Friends,"" Barker's bizarre ode to his knives, and a touching ballad entitled ""Johanna"" - the movie primarily comes off as a strangely interior piece of work that seems to transpire mostly within the confines of one tiny room. That the running time has been padded out with a whole host of superfluous subplots and supporting characters certainly doesn't help matters, with the would-be romance between Barker's daughter and a scrappy young sailor clearly the most obvious example of this. The end result is a film that's sporadically intriguing but mostly dull, which is undoubtedly the last thing one would expect from a filmmaker with as flawless a track record as Burton.  A sequel to Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass, Alice in Wonderland follows a grown-up Alice (Mia Wasikowska) as she's summoned back into the title fantasy world by Michael Sheen's White Rabbit - with the film subsequently revolving around Alice's ongoing efforts at ending the Red Queen's (Helena Bonham Carter) reign of terror. There's little doubt that Alice in Wonderland boasts as impressive and frequently eye-popping a visual sensibility as filmmaker Tim Burton has become known for, as the director does a superb job of transforming Wonderland into an immersive, downright astonishing landscape that ultimately stands as the movie's most compelling attribute. It's just as clear, however, that the film's decidedly thin storyline effectively (and continually) prevents the viewer from wholeheartedly embracing the proceedings, with the proliferation of oddball yet far-from-engrossing characters proving instrumental in perpetuating the movie's arm's-length atmosphere - although, to be fair, there are a few notable exceptions to this (with Carter's amusingly over-the-top turn as the capricious Red Queen an obvious highlight). By the time the larger-than-life, battle-heavy finale rolls around, Alice in Wonderland has undoubtedly established itself as an endeavor that's big on spectacle yet small on plot - which cements its place as big-budget timewaster that just barely manages to squeak by as a result of Burton's visual flair (but really, the movie should've been so, so much better). Based on the long-running television series, Dark Shadows follows vampire Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) as he emerges from a centuries-long imprisonment into swinging 1972 - with the film subsequently exploring Barnabas' fish-out-of-water exploits and, eventually, his efforts at defeating his maker and nemesis (Eva Green's Angelique Bouchard). Filmmaker Tim Burton, working from a script by Seth Grahame-Smith, does a superb job of immediately luring the viewer into the proceedings, as Dark Shadows kicks off with an irresistibly over-the-top prologue detailing Barnabas' lurid past - with the fast-paced and engrossing nature of this stretch heightened by Burton's familiar yet compelling directorial choices. And although the film slows down considerably as it makes the jump into the '70s, Dark Shadows benefits substantially from an initial emphasis on Barnabas' culture shock as the character begins exploring his new surroundings (eg he refers to Alice Cooper, playing himself, as the ""ugliest woman"" he's ever seen). Inevitably, though, the novelty of the premise wears off and the movie slowly-but-surely loses its grip on the viewer, with the increasingly middling midsection, which is devoted primarily to Barnabas' less-than-captivating efforts at both rebuilding his family business and destroying Green's sultry character, paving the way for an action-packed climax that's as conventional as it is tedious. The end result is a disappointingly underwhelming endeavor that stands as the latest misfire from a once rock-solid filmmaker, which is a shame, certainly, since Dark Shadows does possess a good chunk of exceedingly positive attributes (eg Depp's amusingly broad performance). Based on a 29-minute short from 1984, Frankenweenie follows an intrepid youngster (Charlie Tahan's Victor) as he successfully brings his dead dog back to life using a Frankenstein-like contraption. There is, unfortunately, never a point at which it's not completely obvious that Frankenweenie has been adapted from a short film, as the movie, scripted by John August, has been suffused with a number of sequences that are either palpably overlong or flat-out needless - with the padded-out vibe, as anticipated, diminishing the strength of the film's positive attributes. It's clear, though, that Frankenweenie benefits substantially from Tim Burton's expectedly larger-than-life approach to the material, as the director has infused the proceedings with a broad and decidedly gothic sensibility that's more in line with his earlier efforts (Edward Scissorhands, Batman) than with his newer, comparatively garish output (Alice in Wonderland, Dark Shadows). (The film's highlight is, for example, a long, bravura sequence in which Vincent resurrects his departed pooch.) There's a lack of momentum here that grows increasingly problematic as time progresses, however, and it's worth noting, too, that the aggressively action-packed final stretch, which seems to take up a third of the movie's running time, ensures that the film concludes with a whimper instead of a bang. Still, Frankenweenie is nevertheless an obvious step in the right direction for Burton after a series of overwhelming, over-the-top blockbusters - although it's becoming less and less likely that the filmmaker will ever return to the above-average landscape of his first features. Big Eyes tells the true-life story of painter Margaret Keane (Amy Adams), with the movie detailing the character's marriage to Christoph Waltz's charismatic yet sleazy Walter and the eventual fallout of his decision to take credit for her drawings. Filmmaker Tim Burton admittedly does a smashing job of initially drawing the viewer into the proceedings, as the early part of Big Eyes boasts a fast-paced, colorful sensibility that's heightened by Adams' typically appealing turn as the central character. It does become dishearteningly clear, however, that there's just not enough story here to sustain a full-length motion picture, with the film suffering from a repetitive midsection that grows more and more tedious as time progresses (ie once the conflict between Margaret and Walter has been established, Big Eyes treads water to an almost shocking extent). The excessively deliberate pacing and annoyingly over-the-top performance by Waltz compounds the film's simplistic atmosphere, as the narrative increasingly begins to resemble an empowering, feel-good drama that one might expect to see on Lifetime. By the time the bizarre, thematically-incongruous courtroom finale rolls around, Big Eyes has confirmed its place as yet another in a long line of disappointments from a once rock-solid filmmaker. Tim Burton hits rock bottom with this thoroughly misbegotten adaptation of Ransom Riggs' eponymous novel, as the film, which follows Asa Butterfield's Jake as he discovers the title domicile and the assortment of quirky, gifted characters that reside within, comes off as an interminable mess that's too frightening for children and too unfocused and meandering to keep older viewers interested (ie who is the target audience for this disaster, exactly?) Burton's pervasively lazy approach to the wafer-thin material is in evidence virtually from the minute go, with Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children suffering from a shockingly sluggish narrative that's compounded by an absence of three-dimensional characters and an almost aggressively bland and drab visual sensibility (ie why does the movie look as though it was shot through a screen door?) Jane Goldman's padded-out, meandering screenplay grows more and more aimless as time slowly progresses, and it's consequently impossible to work up any interest in Jake's eventual investigation into the oddball happenings at the title locale. The increasingly frenetic and action-packed bent of the movie's second half is nothing short of exhausting, with the viewer's total lack of investment here preventing such moments from generating the thrills and excitement that Burton has undoubtedly intended - which, when coupled with an absolutely endless climax, cements Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children's place as a complete disaster from a director who really needs to be put out to pasture.

That said, there are a few enjoyable factory scenes deserving praise. The squirrel/nut-sorting scene is absolutely adorable. And the TV transport scene has its highlights. Aside from that, the factory tour is rather tedious.  Depp is not Wonka, he's Depp trying to be quirky, creepy, and charming all at once. And Oompas are fun at first, but very quickly bore. As long as they're going to use only one actor (then computer multiply him), why not get someone who can really dance? Break dance, hip-hop, something! The musical sequences are drab, sporting uninspiring songs and direction.
 
I also loved the design and blocking of Charlie's family home. Bent, slanting, pocked with holes out to the snow above, but warm nonetheless. The seating of both sets of grandparents in one bed is absolutely genius.

"Jul 20, 2005",positive," There’s more manic invention, creativity and the sheer joy of filmmaking in any five minutes of Tim Burton’s Charlie and the Chocolate Factory than has yet been seen in all the mainstream releases of 2005 put together. The film is not going to be to everyone’s liking — and thank God for that, because a film that’s to everyone’s liking is, by its very nature, bound to be free of much in the way of risks. And Charlie is nothing if not risk-taking. I remember reading a basically negative review of Spielberg’s War of the Worlds where the writer remarked that it was probably impossible for Spielberg to make a truly bad movie. It’s an arguable statement that I think was meant as a kind of praise, but it strikes me as an assessment of a filmmaker who long ago gave up taking any risks at all. Happily, Burton seems to have sidestepped this pitfall — though it was a close call when he opted to prove he could make a “normal” movie with Planet of the Apes. Of course, remaking a move-loved classic — including Charlie and Apes — was a risk in itself. Few seem to remember now that the original was a huge flop that was rescued from oblivion by TV and the late-night stoner crowd (and, frankly, apart from Gene Wilder’s performance, it isn’t much of a movie). In any case, Burton hasn’t so much remade the 1971 film as he’s put his personal spin on the source book by Roald Dahl — and the results are phenomenal. If ever a filmmaker was suited to his material, Burton is to this. The material, in fact, seems like a Tim Burton picture just waiting to be made — and in collaboration with two of Burton’s most remarkable co-conspirators, Johnny Depp and Danny Elfman. From start to finish, this is a Burton film — with everything that implies, and then some. It’s the “and then some” that pushes his new film into greatness, instead of the movie just being an exercise in Burtonism.  Charlie follows the pattern of virtually Burton’s entire filmography, even to the point of referencing his earlier films. The opening credits, for instance, are in a style that can only be called typical Burton, while the workings of the chocolate factory beneath those credits evoke the Inventor’s cookie machine in Edward Scissorhands. Moreover, the factory itself — perched above the town as a brooding place of mystery — inevitably recalls the Inventor’s improbable castle at the end of a suburban street. Similarly, the new film’s setting continues the director’s love affair with snow — and his final image even jokingly references that this is more an aesthetic romance than a genuine fondness for the powdery white stuff. But there’s more here than a Burton’s Greatest Hits package. It’s not that Burton departs from himself in Charlie — he expands. There’s not much in his previous work to suggest that Burton would make a film that plays like a combination of fairy tale, British Invasion flick and particularly twisted Busby Berkeley musical, but that’s what he’s made here. Which makes sense: Burton is exactly the right age to have been fueled by the pop-art culture referenced here, including Berkeley’s work, which underwent a major revival in the late ’60s and early ’70s. Typically, Burton doesn’t reproduce the things he evokes, but fashions his take based more on his memory of them than on simple reality. This helps Burton capture the freshness that was so a part of the era in which Dahl’s work first appeared, and which now feeds the director’s vision of Dahl’s book. But instead of aping the pop culture of that time, Burton has created what feels like the greatest British Invasion flick never made — and his star and composer seem perfectly in tune with him. Depp’s Willy Wonka, with his pageboy hair and velvet coat, looks for all the world like a disaffected ’60s-era rock star. His Wonka is a startling (some say frightening) creation, wandering through his private world of personal pleasures in a perpetual haze. (The script’s references to “grass” and “flashbacks” are hardly accidental.) But he’s more than a vaguely burnt-out rocker; he’s also the Burton misfit of so many movies. As such, he’s from that world, but not really of it. Willy Wonka is also an extension of Burton’s take on childhood. The character is similar to other Burton heroes in that he has father issues, yet differs in that he cannot relate to, doesn’t understand and doesn’t even like children. This may seem odd in view of Burton’s ability to empathize with the seriousness (to a child) of childhood, but why would you expect a man whose view of childhood is — to put it mildly — rather bleak to identify with its more “normal” inhabitants? The answer, of course, is that you wouldn’t. You’d expect him to be awkward, to distance himself, to not really like them — and perhaps be jealous of them. And that’s exactly what Depp and Burton give us. In keeping with the Invasion-picture tone, we also have Danny Elfman’s score — and more importantly, his songs, which not only evoke the ’60s, but Elfman’s own work with Oingo Boingo. Despite Elfman’s altered vocals, his songs here sound like his own earlier rock music, which was always much influenced by a Brit Invasion sensibility. In a sense, Elfman here returns to his roots, and something similar can be said of Burton. Not only is the director evoking something of his childhood, but Charlie is also a film that calls to mind, more than anything else, the wild energy and cheeky Day-Glo colors of Burton’s first feature, Pee-Wee’s Big Adventure. The result is a brilliant synthesis of Burton’s work to date that also manages to break new ground in such a way that it makes you anxious to see where he will go next. If you can ask for more from a movie than that, then you’re more demanding than I am. Rated PG for quirky situations, action and mild language.

Thank you for being part of this effort to promote respectful discussion. After I got over the feeling that someone had put a mohawk on my beloved old teddy bear, I watched it again.  This version was closer to the book than the Wilder version.  I liked the family better, and I liked Burton’s twist on them.  They were pretty saccharine and one-dimensional in the first film. Depp’s performance, to me, seemed to be quirky for the sake of quirkiness, and too Michael Jackson-esque.  It felt like an experiment that didn’t work, and was then justified with a hastily written-in backstory.  Wonka’s character in the book was a lovable eccentric.  To turn that character into a strange creepy guy with a hint of paedophilia just seems wrong.  I don’t think Dahl would have been pleased.

It felt like an experiment that didn’t work, and was then justified with a hastily written-in backstory.  Wonka’s character in the book was a lovable eccentric.  To turn that character into a strange creepy guy with a hint of paedophilia just seems wrong. Well, to be honest with you, if you take out the notion that he’s meant to evoke Michael Jackson — which never even occurred to me — I’m not sure where you’re getting pedophilia. This may be a generational thing, since I’ve noticed that people for whom Jackson is a youthful pop icon (other than as a kid in the Jackson Five) latch on to this Jackson comparison. I can see where it comes from, but does it match the British Invasion acid-flashback tone of the movie? I’d say not really. To me Wonka is a stoned-out rocker from the 1960s, not Michael Jackson. Apart from the fact that this is Burton’s film and not Dahl’s book, it’s as well to remember that Dahl wasn’t pleased with the earlier version either. Moreover, apart from the very ending of the old version, its Wonka could hardly be described as a “lovable eccentric.” Wilder’s Wonka is downright sinister. ‘Well, to be honest with you, if you take out the notion that he’s meant to evoke Michael Jackson—which never even occurred to me—I’m not sure where you’re getting pedophilia.’ I don’t see where you’re getting that, except from the music and maybe his clothes.  He was repressed, anal, and just generally weird through the whole movie.  He seemed more like a less entertaining Pee-Wee Herman who would wear his pajamas buttoned up to the neck to me.  And the disturbing child-man thing worked for Paul Reubens, but the sexual ambiguity did make you uncomfortable.  That feel of being sexually arrested reminded me of Pee-Wee as well. We’re going to have to agree to disagree on that one.  But I have an admitted bias towards the old version.  I didn’t feel the sense of menace from Wilder’s Wonka that I did from Depp’s, but that’s a personal reflection. BTW, I meant to also say that I liked Carter in this, and I usually don’t care for her (remember the great Mrs. Lovitz debate?).  I agree wth you about her making the perfect Bellatrix Lestrange though. Well, the clothes definitely — look at the Beatles, the Moody Blues, Marc Bolan from the late-mid 60s — and the page-boy hair (definitely not Michael Jackson), and the references to drugs and drug flashbacks. All that says burnt-out 60s rocker to me. Now, I’m not saying that Depp’s Wonka isn’t menacing — only that so is Wilder’s. I’d also not say that this is a bad thing in either case. In fact, the sinister quality of Wilder is all that makes the old movie even watchable to me."

"Jul 19, 2005",positive," 
Deliciously dark and packed with candy-coloured visuals, Tim Burton's adaptation of Roald Dahl's Charlie And The Chocolate Factory is an intoxicating endorphin rush. Freddie Highmore is engagingly winsome as one of five children who scores a ticket to the world's most magnificent chocolate factory. But it's his Finding Neverland co-star Johnny Depp who steals the show as the oddball chocolatier. While the story is a little soft in the centre, his take on Willy Wonka is a richly layered treat. 
There's more than a touch of Wacko Jacko about his childlike demeanour - even down to the nervous giggle - but the genius of Depp's performance is that he manages to be creepy, sympathetic and hilarious all at once; ""Papa?"" he whimpers, when Charlie introduces him to his Grandpa Joe (David Kelly). Straight away it's clear that Wonka is a few fondants short of the whole box... 
Screenwriter John August embellishes Dahl's story with carefully pitched flashbacks to Wonka's traumatic childhood and gives Depp the edge over Gene Wilder's 1971 portrayal. The backstory lends a darker tone, but strangely for Burton, the idea of the four ""rotten children"" who disappear one by one on the factory tour lacks a palpable sense of menace. His greatest strength is in creating a seductive but slightly off-kilter wonderland rippled with chocolate rivers and where marshmallows grow on shrubs harvested by pygmy-like Oompa-Loompas (all played by Deep Roy). With a garnish of zingy dialogue (""Don't touch that squirrel's nuts, it makes him crazy!""), the finished product is a confection sure to bring out the child in any fudge-loving fuddy-duddy."

"Jul 18, 2005",positive," When Charlie Bucket (Highmore) wins one of five golden tickets and thereby an invitation to visit the chocolate factory of reclusive candy-man Willy Wonka (Depp), he takes along Grandpa Joe (Kelly) and embarks on a delightfully perverse jaunt through not only the factory but also the bizarre mind of Wonka himself. This is news to no one, as are the other four invitees: porcine Augustus Gloop (Wiegratz), tiny seether Veruca Salt (Winter), over-competitive Violet Beauregarde (Robb), and video-game addict Mike Teavee (Fry) – all of whom arrive with parentage in tow. I sat through Tim Burton’s generally splendid, artful, and often sinister screen version of Roald Dahl’s classic children’s book with an enormous grin on my face for much of the time. Nevertheless, I was burdened with the nagging feeling a visit to my dentist was long overdue, and also, more alarmingly, that Johnny Depp was simultaneously channeling Kids in the Hall-era Dave Foley, latter-day Michael Jackson, and perpetual KROQ DJ Rodney Bingenheimer to create his own surreal vision of Dahl’s lunatic confectioner. As Burton’s surest cinematic confederate, Depp is unimpeachable, the actorly yin to Burton’s directorial yang, and here he submerges himself in the role as at least as deeply as he did for his most genuine and affecting turn in a Burton film, that of Ed Wood. And yet, his version of Wonka, who appears to dislike children as much as he loves chocolate – a nod to Dahl’s deliciously creepy book – hasn’t to my mind displaced Gene Wilder’s antic portrayal from the 1971 version. To be sure, this Wonka is truer to the source material. Screenwriter John August, although he snatches a handful of third-act liberties, bathes the plot in a welter of verbal and physical gags that serve to machinate the kid-friendly unease into sticky new realms of chewy, gooey alarm. But Depp’s Wonka, despite the revelations of a traumatic youth spent behind an orthodontic wire-frame muzzle that’d give Hannibal Lecter the screaming meemies – or perhaps because of them – seems less mysterious than he ought to be. Not completely knowing if Wonka is friend or foe was (and remains, in Dahl’s book) one of the more adult themes to remain part of the candymaker’s mythology, so much so that even shock-maven Marilyn Manson incorporated it into his first album. Compared with the rest of the film, which dazzles outright with its gob-stopping production design from Alex McDowell and Deep Roy’s unsmiling Oompa Loompas, Depp seems oddly unmoored, even ephemeral; cotton candy to Wilder’s crunchy dark chocolate. Depp’s performance aside, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is pure magic, swimming as it is in a black-treacle riptide of astonishing Oompa Loompa production numbers, an eerie patina of CGI airbrushing (Wonka himself looks downright pasteurized), and some almost too clever in-jokes, and at least two references to Kurt Neumann’s 1958 film The Fly. Unlike the 1971 version, Burton and longtime scorer Danny Elfman use Dahl’s own lyrics for the Oompa Loompa showstoppers, which means the songs are thankfully briefer and less annoying. Other wonders include the great Christopher Lee, who appears as Wonka Sr., the screen’s second most distressing dentist (after Laurence Olivier’s Christian Szell in Marathon Man), and Phillipe Rousselot’s pristine cinematography, which wraps the whole production up in a manic, stylized glow. Devoured together it’s enough to give you a joyous stomachache – or possibly a brain-freeze – of epic proportions.

"Jul 16, 2005",positive," Tim Burton’s Charlie and the Chocolate
 Factory is enough to make any fan of Roald Dahl’s most beloved novel cry — with
 delight at all the film gets so magically right, and with
 frustration that in spite of that the film is still nearly ruined
 by Burton’s obsessions and a spectacularly miscalculated
 performance by star Johnny Depp. No one but Burton could possibly have so perfectly nailed
 Dahl’s blend of whimsical fantasy and withering comeuppance, or
 the Dickensian glee and extravagance of its morality-play
 tableau, with abject poverty and decency lavishly rewarded while
 excess and surfeit and decadence are mercilessly punished. And no one but Burton could possibly have thought it would be
 a good idea to give candymaker extraordinaire Willy Wonka (Depp)
 unresolved issues from childhood stemming from a traumatic
 relationship with his dentist father (Christopher Lee!), leaving
 Wonka unable to say the words ""family"" or ""parents,"" and subject
 to disorienting childhood flashbacks. When the book’s climax and
 denouement have played out, and the credits should be rolling any
 minute now, and the film suddenly invents additional obstacles to
 delay the hero’s reward, then cuts to a scene with the other most
 prominent character on a psychiatrist’s couch, can there be any
 doubt that the film has gone off the rails? And who on earth thought it was a good idea to have Depp play
 Willy Wonka with deathly pale-grey makeup framed by a black bob?
 Did anybody but Depp himself think that his portrayal of Wonka as
 an emotionally stunted, antisocial misfit with a chilly nervous
 giggle, who delivers lines like ""Let’s boogey"" and ""You’re really
 weird"" as if coining new catchphrases, was an improvement over
 Dahl’s character? As badly as Gene Wilder botched the role in
 1971, this is worse. Yet take out Wonka, and what’s left is little short of
 brilliant, far outstripping the 1971 film. From young Charlie
 Bucket (Freddy Highmore, fresh from his last collaboration with
 Depp, Finding
 Neverland), his extended family, and their crazy
 ramshackle house, to the wonders of Wonka’s factory, including
 the Oompa-Loompas and their zany musical numbers, to the
 over-the-top rottenness of the other four children (and for the
 most part their parents), this Charlie and the Chocolate
 Factory is both faithful and inspired, true both to the
 spirit and the letter of the book even as it goes beyond it in
 ways. It’s so good, it has the makings of a modern family
 classic, the dark childhood fantasy that all the Harry Potter
 films and Lemony Snicket
 are trying to be. And yet at the center of it all is one of the best actors in
 Hollywood working as hard as he can to ruin the film, aided and
 abetted by tacked-on excursions into yet another cinematic
 rehashing of Tim Burton’s father figure issues (cf. Big Fish, Edward
 Scissorhands). For those who haven’t read the book, allow me to introduce you
 to a character you won’t meet in either film: Mr. Willy Wonka. As
 Dahl introduces him, we learn of ""marvelously bright"" eyes
 ""twinkling and sparkling at you all the time"" in a face ""alight
 with fun and laughter."" Dahl rhapsodizes about ""how clever he
 looked,"" how ""quick and sharp and full of life,"" in his movements
 ""like a quick, clever old squirrel at the park."" On seeing the
 children, he does a ""funny skipping dance"" and calls out to them
 in a ""high flutey voice."" He’s delighted to meet them all — and
 their parents — and ""clearly just as excited as everyone
 else."" He looks and behaves, in fact, like a slender, hyperactively
 excitable Santa Claus proudly welcoming visitors to a North Pole
 workshop of candy rather than toys. For some inexplicable reason,
 it’s a characterization neither film version to date comes within
 a million miles of. Wilder’s Wonka was almost the polar opposite of Dahl’s
 creation, low-key and darkly ironic. Depp, on the other hand,
 takes the character in a direction at right angles to both Dahl’s
 and Wilder’s versions. Dahl’s Wonka was genuinely friendly;
 Wilder’s Wonka at least knew how to fake it. Depp’s character not
 only doesn’t try, he wouldn’t even know how to. In fact, he’s so
 socially dysfunctional, he has no clue how to make a speech of
 welcome or respond to basic questions without a stack of note
 cards from which he reads as mechanically as a first grader
 sounding out Dr. Seuss. It’s ironic that where the 1971 film was called Willy Wonka
 & the Chocolate Factory, this one takes the name of the
 original book, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, even
 though the climax of the story the filmmakers wish to tell is no
 longer Charlie’s moral triumph or crowning reward, but Willy
 Wonka’s emotional healing and life lessons learned about the real
 meaning of family. On one level, of course, only fans of the book will be
 bothered by the film’s radical reconstruction of the character — though it’s a crying shame that the film bothers to be so
 brilliantly true to the book in almost every other way, only to
 subvert it so thoroughly in this one crucial respect. Yet will
 anyone, even newcomers to the story, find this Willy Wonka
 engaging, interesting, or an any way appealing? Are Wonka’s
 childhood issues really of interest to anyone but Burton and
 Depp? Although the creep factor of Depp’s Wonka is real, the effect
 is somewhat exaggerated by external factors, including timing and
 Depp’s previous choices. As Roger Ebert astutely observes, that
 Depp has acknowleged that his performance in Pirates of the Caribbean
 was largely inspired by Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones has
 primed us to look for inspirations here as well. And, as it happens, recent events make it nearly impossible,
 watching this film, not to think of another emotionally stunted,
 reclusive millionaire child-man with pale skin and black hair who
 built a fantasy wonderland for himself and then invited children
 into it. The ""Neverland"" connection of Depp’s last film, in which
 he played yet another emotionally stunted child-man who created
 fantasy worlds — and was explicitly suspected of pedophilia — doesn’t help matters. Yet there’s no hint in Depp’s brittle
 performance of Michael Jackson’s mannerisms or speech
 patterns. And the rest of the film is good enough that it’s worth
 gritting one’s teeth and looking past Willy Wonka. From the
 hypercompetitiveness of Violet Beauregarde (Annasophia Robb,
 Because of
 Winn-Dixie) — and of her ex-cheerleader mother, who
 competes vicariously through her daughter — to the aggressive,
 impatient computer-game mentality of video junkie Mike Teavee
  (Jordan Fry), the film’s cautionary satire hits bullseyes. The casting — again, Depp aside — is perfect. Old David Kelly
  (Waking Ned Devine) is note-perfect as Grandpa Joe, and Indian
 actor Deep Roy (Big Fish,
 Planet of the Apes)
 brings solemn dignity to the role of all 100 Oompa-Loompas, whose
 show-stopping musical numbers, composed by longtime Burton
 collaborator Danny Elfman to lyrics drawn (unlike those of the
 ""Oompa Loompa Song"" of the earlier film) straight from Dahl, made
 me want to stand up and cheer. If only the camera didn’t keep
 coming back to Depp every time the music winds down. Along with Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and The 10,000 Fingers of Dr. T, Willy Wonka illustrates the distinct possibility of telling a fairy-tale like story about a child transported to a fantasy wonderland, with brightly costumed little people singing and dancing and strange dangers to be negotiated, yet winding up with a film that is more a fond tribute to ""pure imagination"" than a triumph of it."
