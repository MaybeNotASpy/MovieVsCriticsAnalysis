Mar 5 2024,positive,its always exciting to see a superheros origin story come to life especially being a beloved character from the comics the dynamic duo chemistry between carol and fury is out of this world and added a refreshing layer to nick furys usual mysterious demeanor from amazing fight sequences and visually appealing superpowers to emotional performances and exciting world building this superhero movie has it all and can be enjoyed by all ages
Feb 24 2024,positive,great way to sew up an origin story i wish itd have had more integration with the original lore but thats fine
Feb 23 2024,negative,bland boring and with a forgettable main character the star is only for the cat
Feb 21 2024,positive,decided to rewatch this movie because i actually enjoyed the marvels    i blame marveldisney for captain marvels live action debute  it was already too late to introduce captain marvel literally the last minute in phase 3  come on  would of been a smarter move to introduce cap marvel in phase 2 around the time gotg 1 came out then have cap marvel 2 in phase 3  this would of given the character to grow with the audience as we moved through the infinity saga    but good job to brie larson to have to work with such a weak scriptstory
Feb 20 2024,positive,this fits in well with the early mcu origin stories mixing a nice albeit safe mix of action and humor brie is great fanboys are weird
Feb 19 2024,positive,i rewatched this movie just before watching the marvels  i been an mcu fan since iron man and honestly the mcu will never be as great as it was in phase 13    this movie would of been great if they didnt rush and shoehorn captain marvel in the last phase introducing her earlier around the time of guardians of the galaxy would of been better for her character    overall there is a story there is somewhat of character development could of been better if the writing was better
Feb 16 2024,positive,though panned by many i enjoyed this origin story  good characters great action and marvels signature humor  fun to watch
Feb 11 2024,positive,loved the nestaligia of the 90s miss those days thought the story was pretty good didnt much care for the back story of how fury lost his eye but loved goose and the movie over all was good
Feb 5 2024,positive,this was a really good marvel movie yes its a another origin story type but a solid one i loved the chemistry that brie larson and samuel l jackson had and the visuals and music score were great
Dec 18 2023,positive,it rises to the occasion with strong performances and with its directors willingness to slow down and take their story seriously balancing humor action and exposition in a carefully calibrated package
Dec 16 2023,positive,this film has a sense of awesomeness the character of carol danvers is iconic the story is great it has a philosophical undertone about the meaning of life carol impersonating light itself one scene reminded me of gattaca one of my favorites films ever nick fury also shines as do maria rambeau  the weakest point for me is the lack of distinctive environment that i will remember except the house of maria and monica rambeau in louisiana and the military airport however it has some memorable scenes and the general aesthetics is great with an omnipresent 90s nostalgia  i have an emotional attachment to this story and its characters since the first time i saw it i love carol danvers i love the rambeau family i love goose i loved the marvels and kamala khans character as well i really hope we get a last film to close the trilogy
Nov 24 2023,positive,saw this again prior to watching the marvels this is a great movie with a lot of action and acting from everyone it helps tie a lot of the marvel movies together now and during the time of the avengers both captain marvels are great hopefully they will find a way to make a third movie despite of all the haters
Nov 24 2023,positive,the movie was amazing loved the introduction of hank at the end more mutants are now existing in the mcu on the big screen   and the finishing touch on kate bishop
Nov 23 2023,negative,captain marvel disappoints on multiple fronts delivering a lackluster superhero narrative tainted by an underdeveloped protagonist lackluster special effects and conspicuous plot holes the central character comes across as hastily conceived lacking the depth needed to establish a genuine connection with the audience   the disjointed narrative structure adds to the challenges hindering the overall enjoyment of the movie  enduring captain marvel becomes a tiresome undertaking with questionable script choices only exacerbating the frustration
Nov 18 2023,negative,after the awful press beforehand i expected to hate this movie at first it was just bland and boring i found nothing about the characters or plot compelling but all of the retconned stuff was tortured nonsense and nick fury losing his eye to the stupid cat just made me hate it even more    carol being out in space and fury never calling his backup superman until he did was contrived and stupid nothing about the mcus use of this character is good or interesting    just blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah      marvel couldnt even give me a movie to hate just a movie that bored me and i wish never had been made  not even lame enough to hate so superpathetic
Nov 18 2023,neutral,its fine the best thing about this movie was fury with goose
Nov 16 2023,positive,captain marvel is good its villains are forgettable and trashy but its a fun colorful adventure all in all
Nov 16 2023,positive,i really liked this movie i think larson is doing a great job  i have seen it at least 3 maybe 4 times
Nov 14 2023,positive,its alright i personally enjoyed it
Nov 14 2023,neutral,good cgi bland story
Nov 13 2023,negative,boring short movie that feels super long plot is weak and acting is even worse
Nov 12 2023,positive,this was a great movie i suggest watching wanda vision and ms marvel on disney plus before watching the movie is not getting the credit it deserves
Nov 12 2023,positive,very enjoyable great chemistry between larson and jackson
Nov 12 2023,positive,fantastic film peak marvel
Nov 12 2023,positive,captain marvel starts out with a huge disadvantage because it was released alongside avengers endgame it had to succeed in the shadow of the biggest marvel movie ever and one of the biggest blockbuster movies ever despite being overshadowed by endgame and being released in a time when comic book movies were getting dangerously close to reaching a saturation point captain marvel is an innovative exciting and compelling superhero movie we get to see nick fury in the 90s and there are enough surprises to give this movie plenty of momentum its a fun popcorn movie and a solid step into a postthanos marvel universe 
Nov 11 2023,positive,one of my favorite mcu films dont understand the hate for members of the cast its funny explores a great character who has depth and trauma to explore fantastic cast
Nov 11 2023,positive,this movie carol and brie larson all deserve better
Nov 10 2023,positive,its a interesting start to carols story a little awkward when carol is on the side of kree but once free feels more natural and likable
Nov 10 2023,negative,this movie really disappointed me following wonderwoman i was excited to see what marvel would do with their first female lead project unfortunately the movie was a boring drag to get through carol isnt aware of who she is for the majority of the movie and whats worse the audience isnt either i never really felt like i got a good sense of who she was as a human not what she accomplished or how powerful she was but who she was     wonder woman showed us a strong and caring individual and it focused on her journey captain marvel showed us how men try and hold women down which may be a fine story to tell but wasnt what i want in a superhero film show us her being strong and capable stop telling us
Nov 10 2023,negative,i expected more from the film relevance to the overall story and its hard to empathise with the main character i just couldnt enjoy it
Nov 10 2023,positive,really enjoyable peace of film
Nov 10 2023,positive,in preparation for the coming the marvels i decide to rewatch it  honestly a little better than how i remembered watching this back when it was in theaters  not the best writing but not terrible either  i still stand with carol danvers being played by brie larson as a good choice especially with her interactions with nick fury maria and her daughter monica and even to when she was looking for not only her mission but also her memories  i wont lie the villain choice was as weak as say either iron man 2 or 3s villain choice and thinking that is part of how the writing can be questionable  hell this movie doesnt deserve all the hate it was given and neither was brie larson herself since i still enjoy her character since ive seen her play well as carol  if this was released earlier in the mcu saga like around iron man or captain america this wouldve gotten a higher score  not a perfect marvel movie but still a fun one especially for the fans out there  710
Nov 9 2023,positive,i like the movie and love brie larson as captain marvel
Nov 9 2023,positive,i loved every second of itits a good movie no the best one but its definitely enjoyable and fun to watch the visuals are on point it gave me almost everything i wanted and introduced us to an amazing new characterand without a doubt her character will be polished as time goes by
Nov 8 2023,positive,the visuals are incredible i think its mediocre the first watch but gets better each time you watch it
Nov 8 2023,positive,loved this fresh take on the marvel character and brie larsons work and especially loved the storyline classic guy gaslighting woman until she sees through the bullshit plotting weakness and the necessity of a big spectacular fight scene at the end seems more tired though than in other marvel films still a winner
Nov 3 2023,positive,the more i watch this movie the more i feel it was judged unfairly
Nov 1 2023,positive,its a best cosmic intergalactic epic adventure origin of newest superhero of mcu marvel prove once again its a best great visual storyteller how things fit into it its a one of the best live action debut of all time love it absolutely awesome with great humour action nd lot of heart nd epic thrill ride adventure 
Oct 31 2023,positive,very similar plot to tangled and i love tangled
Oct 30 2023,negative,it passed the time and was a fun watch but definitly not amazingly written or something it could have been a lot better
Oct 28 2023,positive,its not amazing but its a pretty decent entry to the mcu
Oct 27 2023,positive,this movie is not that bad there are definitely some parts that are boring
Oct 27 2023,positive,received a lot of trash talk on youtube but its actually a pretty decent film with some great supporting characters my main complaint is that its not well positioned in the mcu slate of films they should have either had it an earlier phase or saved it and used it to kick off the new phase after end game    ive heard a lot of youtubers complain theres no character arc but the youtube experts seem to have missed the fact that its a memory loss story memory loss stories dont normally have arcs the memory loss trope replaces it
Oct 24 2023,negative,terrible story with no character development and opsticls
Oct 20 2023,positive,it is rather predictable and the villains are boring and bland but it has its moments of humor great action scenes and the good guys are interesting enough to make up for the boring villains
Oct 17 2023,positive,truly a work of art best movie ever made i would give 6 stars if i could its a masterpiece and makes movies like star wars shawshank redemption forrest gump and its a wonderful life look like they were directed by children this is my favorite movie next to wonderwoman and live action little mermaid
Oct 15 2023,positive,there is nothing wrong with brie larson as captain marvel the issue is with the film the fact that it keeps on is such a drag
Oct 4 2023,neutral,honestly so mad with the way they wasted brie larson here not blaming the writers for fan toxicity but how could they handle the first femaleled mcu film so irresponsibly
Sep 29 2023,positive,captain marvel is a good superhero origin story i watched this film first in theaters and then recently on amazon prime video and i must say that the movie feels different on a streaming platform the format allows for a more upclose personal intimate experience that gives access to the actors eyes and faces and also to subtitles to better understand the abundant dialogue i think marvel fans initially gave this film completely unfair reviews the fans were hopped up on postavengers infinity war adrenaline and had exceedingly high and unrealistic expectations for the next marvel film the fact that captain marvel was a woman also triggered a lot of sexist and misogynistic outrage from the usual crowd captain marvel is not the greatest film ever made but its certainly not the worst superhero film marvel studios ever released ultimately its not about girl power or men bashing  its about celebrating the strength and resilience of the human spirit do watch it on streaming with the subtitles on youll see what i mean
Sep 29 2023,positive,i liked it   the sight gags about the 90s got just a bit tiresome stan lees cameo was his best in the mcu it was cheapened a bit when cpt marvel winks at him in something akin to a 4th wall break   all told it was a fun watch i should also mention that i ignored everything bri larson said for a year before it released if i had not i probably wouldnt have liked it as much
Sep 28 2023,negative,in my option this is one of the poorest written marvel movies
Sep 27 2023,positive,a cliche marvel movie that follows the same plot beats as many predecessors however the movie is boosted by some charismatic performaces from ben mendelsson brie larson and samuel l jackson however the villain is a bland character who we know will have no impact later down the line
Sep 22 2023,positive,way better than misogynists want you to think
Sep 14 2023,negative,why would anyone want to watch a movie about an overpowered protagonist and the archenemy isnt even stronger he just tells her to control her powers
Sep 13 2023,positive,i know many people dislike this movie but i found it genuinely entertaining and endearing better than the average super hero movie
Sep 13 2023,positive,perfect movie brie was amazing
Sep 8 2023,negative,this is probably the 2nd worst movie i have ever seen in my life and i have seen some doozies the story didnt accelerate the infinity saga at all it felt like a spin off of guardians of the galaxy ronan is the 3rd most boring villian in the mcu only behind aldrich killian and crossbones
Sep 7 2023,neutral,not a great movie but also not terrible had a few entertaining ideas and good scenes overall not a very impressive superhero movie glad i didnt see it in the theaters how this movie made 400 million domestic i will never understand
Sep 3 2023,positive,realy uderrated movie
Aug 30 2023,positive,another fun movie from marvel and a good translation of the character to the mcu ditching some of the more cringe elements of the characters history
Aug 28 2023,positive,this movie was really goodit plays the origin story of captain marvel really wellbrie larson and samuel l jackson shined in theyre performancesthe actions scenes couldve been better but overall this movie was really good
Aug 26 2023,positive,great movie good storyline humour a must see for marvel fans
Aug 24 2023,negative,captain marvel isnt groundbreaking or a particularly quality piece of cinema but its like mcdonalds  its poorly made by heller entertaining  or in the burgers case  delicious
Aug 18 2023,positive,the moderate wellpaced storytelling has always stood out to me in this movie between danvers reclaiming who she truly is and the story of the scrolls captain marvel has always left me more than satisfied
Aug 18 2023,positive,i love how this film introduces an extremely powerful character something that is very difficult to maintain a certain balance but it worked very well
Aug 17 2023,positive,this movie is often looked down on by fans but it surely does not deserve any of that hate there were some really good moments and i thought brie larson did a good job playing captain marvel i just wish there was better plot elements that shouldve been added in to the story id give it a decent 610 to be fair
Aug 14 2023,positive,great marvel movie better than most of phase 4
Aug 13 2023,positive,i enjoyed it i dont get the hate for this movie
Aug 11 2023,positive,great movie with logically ideas
Aug 9 2023,negative,only a handful of marvel movies turn out boring imo this is one of them a movie like this relies on the charisma of its lead unfortunately that was sorely lacking in this film which is odd since brie seems likeable in the interviews ive seen
Aug 7 2023,positive,one of my favorite marvel movies so awesome and fun and hilarious with some emotional moments and mind evolving moments maybe ur the brainwashed one
Aug 5 2023,negative,it was so cringe and felt like they were on a 100 budget
Aug 5 2023,positive,great origin story pacing was good and if you dont expect it to be as grand as avengers infinity war well youll leave the theater plenty satisfied with captain marvel    brilliant acting perfectly timed funny moments good buddy relationship marvel and fury fab supporting cast and enough of a story to have some measure of consistency with the carol danvers canon its enough for movie buffs casual fans though im not sure about the hardcore comic fans    stay for the mid and end credits    now ive become a fan of brie larson after this movie she is cute gorgeous and quite obviously a terrific actress an academy award winner already st such a young age
Aug 5 2023,positive,another good movie of the mcu loved seeing new lore for fury and the kree i recommend it
Aug 3 2023,positive,i loved this movie since the first watch full of action adventure and full of fun especially seeing captain marvels powers also one of the most beautiful visuals ive seen in the mcu great and amazing movie
Jul 31 2023,negative,terrible only reason im not giving this a half star is cause i like nick fury so much boring and bad that couldnt keep me interested
Jul 31 2023,negative,it just was overall bad writing and there was no overall meaninful message unless the message is you dont have to work for somthing becuase your all ready perfect
Jul 31 2023,positive,i so excited for the marvels cause was amazing
Jul 31 2023,positive,brie plays an intelligent and believable character along with samual jackson jude law and annette benning well made and fun to watch recommend
Jul 30 2023,positive,one of the more unique superhero origin stories and a great soundtrack to boot brie larson and samuel jackson were great together  though have to admit goose stole the show the whole time the running gag about furys eye being in danger was a hilarious use of this movies semiprequel status
Jul 29 2023,positive,i have a few nitpicks here and there but overall one of the better marvel films its very interesting that this has a 45 audience rating yet made over 1 billion can you say review bomb
Jul 28 2023,positive,underrated mcu movie
Jul 25 2023,neutral,eh its not really good
Jul 24 2023,positive,this movie is great there is something just so different about this film that makes it great this is the second movie to watch by timeline order and this film overall feels like a film from a different year great movie
Jul 24 2023,positive,excellent marvel film with great characters and story samuel l jackson and brie larson were terrific
Jul 24 2023,positive,this movie isnt too bad i know a lot of people hate this film but i dont really mind it to be honest i really enjoyed samuel l jackson and ben mendelsohn in this one
Jul 23 2023,neutral,captain marvel introduces a powerful new hero to the mcu but it suffers from a weak plot that may not fully engage all audiences
Jul 23 2023,neutral,capitan marvel is not the best of superheroes the character lacks depth
Jul 21 2023,negative,if i could give this 0 stars i would
Jul 19 2023,positive,yall mad shes stronger than your fave lmao
Jul 19 2023,negative,most of the people that are critiquing the people giving criticism are saying that were sexist apparently to quote a youtube title i saw recently the audience doesnt hate strong women it just hates bad writing of which is plentiful here the fact that carol here just seems like an arrogant prick which is only proven further when she says she can take thanos in endgame without even knowing who the hell thanos was just makes you hate her it certainly doesnt make you want to root for her in honesty fury was fine the lesbian airforce pilot was fine which proves again that strong females arent the problem but the fact that theres a main character you dont like just brings the movie down
Jul 19 2023,positive,good movie not great but good for an origin story it has some flaws but good movie enjoyed it  
Jul 18 2023,positive,people who dont like this movie show a small valid point it can be a little bland at times but the overall story is amazing i feel people expecting way too much of this film without actually understanding a character and why they would act a certain way it has a lot of marvel humor which i personally love but if you dont like that kind of humor you wont be as much of a fan of the film it is very female forward the plot revolves around selfdiscovery in a way about captain marvelcarol danvers finding out who she is after gaining her powers i also think the villain of the story is well written and the final sequence aka the last battle scene was really well done ive seen a lot of people criticize the final battle scene as being anticlimactic and i feel those people fail to see why it was written the was that it is its not in the top 10 best marvel films of all time but as their first female centered movie they do a really good job
Jul 18 2023,positive,it rises to the occasion with strong performances and with its directors willingness to slow down and take their story seriously balancing humor action and exposition in a carefully calibrated package
Jul 17 2023,positive,fun movie with action and humor one of the better first movies from marvel
Jul 17 2023,negative,terrible she had no character and no personality her powers are lame her outfit is lame her look is lame there is nothing unique about her the whole movie was a boring cgi filled nothing boring
Jul 16 2023,positive,although samuel jackson ben mendelsohn  and jude law all did exceptional the rest of the film was fine brie larson was okay and the script was a little much this was definitely not the mcu at its best
Jul 12 2023,positive,not great but not terrible the deaging cgi on fury as well as goose the flerken were the main highlights  mediocre overall
Jul 12 2023,negative,i cant tell you how excited i got when captain marvels badge appeared on the pager it was a beacon of hope after the dystopian ending in infinity war then i watched this movie they took a wonderful character amazing actress and somehow shoehorned them into a lifeless bland movie with no heart at all the worst thing is not only did they waste a great actress and character they diminished some of their established and loved characters in the process
Jul 11 2023,positive,it was not fantastic but not a 40ish bad    i just had issues with the era this was in and the fact that it was all about a race i knew little to nothing about vs grounded in the mcu characters i am more familiar with
Jul 11 2023,negative,disappointing one of the earliest signs of the decaying marvel franchise
Jul 8 2023,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed this movie i knocked down a half star as the beginning was a tad slow but mostly because i wish brie larson had more lines but overall this will definitely join in the rotation of marvel comfort films this is an action packed girl power movie that is perfect for the 90s time period and can show little girls of today what they can do and accomplish    i regret not seeing it sooner as i had let the reviews of others persuade me and i hate that the misogynistic people of the critics world and general audience viewers made me think anything less
Jul 5 2023,positive,how to bring to the big screen a character that most already know and that is extremely powerful i was pleasantly surprised most of the movie is not about blasting things up  would have liked to have her evolve more from her early days into a superhero some storytelling details that could have been less forced but ben mendelsohn is great especially early in the movie
Jul 5 2023,negative,in order for this movie to work you have to like the main character and pull for her to become a hero  but the character presented here just comes across as arrogant from start to finish   the special effects arnt exciting or engaging and the plot is don  pop aint by numbers its boring   theres a nice use of playing around with the b marvel timeline but by the films end you have a superhero whos biggest power is how to annoy everyone in the audience   a hero needs to be humble and graceful   if not then they just feel like a overpowered problem   wonder woman did this story with class but this is just a terrible knock off   that you cant remember as soon as you leave the theatre
Jul 2 2023,positive,another in the category of i disagree with the audience score although with this one its obvious on account of the right wing incel crowd negative review bombing it because 1 it has a woman as the main protagonist and 2 that woman has dared to speak up about sexism   its not the perfect movie but it is a fun watch it does have a reasonable story and i am currently watching the whole mcu through in timeline order having only seen about 25 maybe a third of all the insanely numerous titles there are now previously and seeing the ways in which it ties in with the larger mcu story as i know it so far is a lot of fun
Jul 1 2023,negative,this was very mediocre nick fury was great and the skrulls were a very welcome addition but it seems like marvel doesnt know what they want to do with captain marvel one minute shes getting her butt kicked in hand to hand combat the next shes destroying space ships with ease i dont understand what they were trying to do with her
Jun 22 2023,positive,it rises to the occasion with strong performances and with its directors willingness to slow down and take their story seriously balancing humor action and exposition in a carefully calibrated package
Jun 21 2023,positive,its not amazing nevertheless a fun movie
Jun 18 2023,negative,the movie just dumps on tradition and history of the mcu nick furys eye injury the tesseract in a lunchbox the silly nerf gun prank worst infinity saga movie
Jun 15 2023,positive,everyone knows that about 12 of the audience reviews are without merit because theyre full of incels who are upset that marvel gave a woman a lead superhero movie the truth is this is one of the best origin story films from the mcu we get a young fury predirector of shield a young phillip coulson a very young monica r who is in wandavision and 2023s the marvels and we also get the moment that fury has the idea for the the avengers the amount of canon awesomeness in this movie makes it loads of fun bri larson is an oscar winning actress this film departs from her usual serious drama acting and sometimes you feel that but ultimately we do root for her character and we do sympathize with her and she does a great job at embodying just how powerful cm is the underlying girl power theme meant the world to me when i saw it in theaters and 4 years later whenever i see it again about 34 times i still cry during the beginning of the climax when every version of her throughout time stands up after getting knocked down inspiring fun a great mcu experience better than some of the most recent films for sure
Jun 14 2023,positive,is fun movie and brie larson is incredible with captain marvel
Jun 8 2023,negative,one of the worst movie in mcu since incredible hulk flat screen writing and worst characterisation made me bore except the first half an hour the whole movie was too bad
Jun 2 2023,neutral,ok movie  one time watchable for its lead to endgame
Jun 1 2023,positive,i dont understand the negative reviews  this cant possibly be accurate for a movie that made over a billion dollars at the box office  it is fun and exciting
May 30 2023,positive,i feel as if this is part of the new age of the 1st movie is only setup as it was a tad slow
May 29 2023,neutral,not saying it did not have some positive factors music goose the cat but all in all noy a good mcu movie   larson is not convincing the dialouges are forced  loads of uncalled for toxicity against nick fury an element that repeated every 5 minutes   honestly it made ms marvel not critical for mcu arc
May 29 2023,positive,the movie isnt as bad as some say but it does feel like a bit of a drag to watch
May 28 2023,positive,to be honest this movie wasnt as bad as many said it was true id rather watch another marvel film because this film is slow but still  compared some of the other newer films this one is better
May 23 2023,positive,i honestly think the majority of negative reviews come from incels who hate seeing a powerful woman and given all that was said online i feel pretty justified saying that its a great film with a great cast lots of funny moments and a great storyline plus after years of them treating black widow like eye candy for the avengers its nice to have a female empowerment film if you dont hate women because one wouldnt date you then youll love it
May 23 2023,positive,this movie was mcu standard it definitely wouldve fair better if it came out in phases 1 or 2 love the scenes where carroll  nick fury were acting like buddy cops however the villain was forgettable they didnt do og marvel justice  haphazardly sets up the kree  skrulls conflict with that being said this movie was overhated  often use in bad faith arguments to justify so called criticism of female representation i hope the sequel fairs better
May 23 2023,negative,it is one of the worst movies i watched made by marvel boring irrational condescending and completely unlikable main character who looks sometimes more like the villain of the movie
May 21 2023,positive,i liked this movie it was a solid entry in mcu the flerken scratch was an amusing way for fury to lose his eye comic purists need to lighten up
May 18 2023,negative,just a poor movie in comparison to most of the earlier marvel productions
May 16 2023,negative,captain marvel is not a good movie the casting was off the villain was onenote the plot was confusing and i had no vested interest in the final outcome just like vers i was completely lost between the kree the skrulls and a mutant cat named goose i like brie larson in other films but she was completely miscast in this role carol danvers was described as having too much emotion however brie larson did not show any range of emotion in this film any feeling that was expressed seemed forced and rigid i got so bored watching captain marvel that i stopped and watched paul blart mall cop to wake up before finishing not even a crash into a blockbuster and a fight with a granny could save this film honestly its a good thing that this movie is smack between infinity war and endgame otherwise my faith in the mcu might have been lost
May 15 2023,positive,this is an over hated movie wouldnt say its great but its a ok movie
May 15 2023,negative,hahaha tha horrible thing cant be called a movie
May 13 2023,negative,cosmic karen with a brick of cheese for a face skulks around until she decide to believe in herself  sphynctal cringe deeper harder puckeryer
May 9 2023,negative,captain marvel was an interesting move for marvel they were originally planning on releasing the next avengers movie but the stan lee the owner of marvel tragically passed away so in honor of him they made the movie dedicated to him about captain marvel the most powerful hero in the mcu
May 9 2023,negative,felt very monotone didnt care for the movie overrall
May 9 2023,positive,this movie wouldnt have suffered so badly if it didnt come out between infinity war and endgame i have seen it four times since it came out and i keep hoping that it will get better with each watch but that isnt the case overall it is an okay movie and not the worst outing in the mcu i only couldnt connect with captain marvel as a character
May 8 2023,neutral,captain marvel is boring and kinda dumb
May 8 2023,negative,this movie was boring i even forget the plot even when i am watching it
May 6 2023,positive,one of my fav stand alone marvels
May 5 2023,positive,boring and average such a shame one of the greatest marvel characters reduced to star trek knockoff
May 5 2023,positive,captain marvel finally gives young girls and women a powerful archetype in the mcu for the woman as hero who overcomes the obstacles that the universe puts in her way to control her and keep her in bondage carols whole story is based on identifying processing and breaking free of the gaslighting and controls placed on her by those who have exploited her and her power for imperialism and the oppression of others its also just a ton of fun with great 90s references and music carol and fury have great chemistry as buddy cops seeking to uncover the truth and protect people from the schemes of others great fights great action and a great story brie larson is amazing in this role
May 3 2023,positive,ok movie where she fights aliens and humans they could have made more sense of the story captain marvel was a man back then not a woman too
May 2 2023,neutral,it not a bad film it just that the underdog scenes remind me of first avenger and the script wasnt good  brie is not bad as danvers the character not having emotion  work for the character because of the  indoctrination by the kree
May 2 2023,positive,captain marvel is a really cool movie that tells us the story of carol denvers in a fresh and quirky way compared to other marvel movies    brie larson is a perfect choice for portraying her i couldnt think of anyone else plus the chemistry between her and samuel l jackson is really good since theyre great friends irl and capable of delivering lots of unforgettable funny moments    another thing that makes this movie special for me is the amazing stan lee tribute in the marvel intro and cameo which i gotta say its my favourite one a simple yet powerful heartwarming exchange of genuine smiles between stan and brie thank you stan for everything    dont let anyone fool you you might have heard bad things about the movie the character or even the actress herself im just going to say watch it and judge for yourself im sure its going to be worth your while
May 1 2023,negative,bad acting bad casting bad storyline no struggles no emotions killed the whole story behind the last time i trusted someone i lost an eye  captain america the winter soldier 2014 i didnt even finish the movie in 1 time i had to pause it 3 times because i was so bored and annoyed sam jackson deserved better garbage movie
May 1 2023,positive,i dont get the hate for this film yeah it was a little boring but overall it was a solid film
Apr 30 2023,positive,this movie is amazing its the most fun marvel movie ive ever seen no shoehorned in romance no overly sexualized female superhero
Apr 29 2023,negative,probably one of the worst if not the worst mcu movie in the 30 movies they have made
Apr 27 2023,positive,not bad as everyone said about it its fun and have quite the story love to see a younger coulson  fury love the glowing powers of carol
Apr 25 2023,negative,this movie has flashbacks that should have imho been in the beginning to build up a connection with the characters instead of the order it was laid out  also the political refugees are best those that are against them are evil message took off 2 stars
Apr 25 2023,positive,absolutely loved this movie brie was great in it incels  youtube liars who ran a hate campaign in 2019 even before this movie was released to review bomb and tank the audience review can go eat grass kudos to rotten tomatoes for changing the audience review process after this 
Apr 25 2023,positive,love love love love beautiful work
Apr 22 2023,positive,this is a movie that i dont watch all that often but when i do i like it more and more someone mentioned it on reddit the other day and we discussed its merits in the chat and then i spent the afternoon rewatching it its a fun damn movie and clever too i love the lore that it sets up and it was smart of marvel to clear our palettes after infinity war to introduce carol danvers and then watch her do her stuff in endgame i truly enjoy this movie
Apr 22 2023,negative,boring not much more i can say about it other than the plot couldnt be saved by brie larsons stilted bored acting
Apr 20 2023,positive,love it carol is a bad a and she makes the insecure men on twitter so mad so her impact is really unmatched 
Apr 17 2023,negative,if you are a fan of the source material and canon  you will find this movie truly horrible if you are not a marvel fan you will also find this film horrible it is not entertaining i am a decades long marvel fan and enjoyed most of the marvel movies prior to this
Apr 15 2023,positive,i watched it a little later than i should have but i really enjoyed it i liked the theme and the action i hope they put captain marvel in more movies
Apr 13 2023,positive,the cgi is great but the plot is cliche
Apr 12 2023,negative,rubbish it seemed like a rushed movie to introduce a new character before avengers end game
Apr 12 2023,negative,like it was actually not as god awful but it is still bad 
Apr 10 2023,negative,while the movie had some decent  action scenes and special effects overall i found it to be underwhelming the story lacked depth and failed to keep me engaged and the characters didnt have enough development to make me care about their fates additionally the humor fell flat in many places and the pacing felt off with some scenes dragging on too long while others seemed rushed overall i was disappointed with this movie and while it may appeal to some fans of the superhero genre it didnt meet my expectations
Apr 9 2023,negative,awful movie samuel l jackson needed his own movie instead of this crap
Apr 9 2023,negative,captain marvel is one of the films in this cinematic universe that falls flat generic and uninteresting the good visuals and acting dont save it    rating 37
Apr 5 2023,positive,the user score got review bombed by mad magas this is a good movie 
Apr 2 2023,positive,it had good pieces but ive never seen a movie brie larson was good in different lead actress and this would have been better
Mar 31 2023,positive,such a good movie love the audio and visual effects   great pick of colors and background music
Mar 27 2023,positive,i basically want to be carol danvers
Mar 26 2023,neutral,captain marvel is an extraterrestrial kree warrior who finds herself caught in the middle of an intergalactic battle between her people and the skrulls living on earth in 1995 she keeps having recurring memories of another life as us air force pilot carol danvers with help from nick fury captain marvel tries to uncover the secrets of her past while harnessing her special superpowers to end the war with the evil skrulls    the reveiw captain marvel should only be watch if you are watching the whole mcu or your going to watch endgamethe plot is mid and the fight scenes are flat ot terrible the best part of it though is the introduction of young nick fury and the tesseract this later help set the plot for secret invasions the acting and cinematography were okay while the cgi was good enough
Mar 22 2023,negative,by far worst marvel movie acting was horrible and main character was the wrong choice for this movie would have liked to of seen a better actress and story line
Mar 21 2023,positive,im surprised by these ratings i really loved this movie
Mar 19 2023,negative,i dont think i could dislike this movie more
Mar 17 2023,negative,awful film bs honestly thought brei was sexy back in the day and now from seeing how she is via social media ect i think shes a horrible person
Mar 17 2023,positive,brilliant film watch it 3 times in the last 1 year and i believe they did a good job making this
Mar 16 2023,negative,i watched this atrocity with low expectations i was not disappointed    brie larsen is a cardboard cutout delivering lines with the skill of a high school thespian completely unconvincing and unlikeable in her hero superhero role she has none of the athleticism or charisma youd expect     the plot is a garbled mishmash of cheap special effects and tedious fight scenes     i couldnt finish this embarrassment i was already weary of superhero flicks captain marvel hastened the process
Mar 14 2023,negative,i cannot tell you how badly i wanted to love this movie  i had no preconceptions regarding any of the actors in this film i was just so looking forward to another great mcu movie  the first time i watched it i was so shocked at the horrible acting  specifically  the poor delivery by brie larson it was not just that she was flat and uninspiring  she was actually annoying on screen and it distracted from the entire film for me only after i had watched this film i read up about brie larson and was made aware of all of the controversy surrounding the actress herself  i am disabled and my physical limitations often leave me living in a very small type of world  so i was not exposed to anything beyond the films and the mcu or other films i choose to watch     to because i wanted to love or at least like this movie so much  and in anticipation of the next mcu avengers movie  i decided to watch it a second time thinking that if i watched it while i was in less physical pain and a better frame of mind then the first time i watched it that i could enjoy it  but it was painful to watch the second time  even more so than the first time the script is not terrific but because i really just love the mcu i could have gotten past that  but i could not get past the absolute dislike of brie larsons performance i could not find a way to like the character  now that im rewatching some of the mcu movies while recovering from another medical procedure all i can say is that i am happy that this movie is not important to watch and somehow seem so disconnected from the rest of the mcu that i can just pretend it does not exist    the biggest disappointment is how much potential this movie could have and should have had more than a missed opportunity  a complete train wreck for lack of a better term    save yourself some money and pass on this film and even if youre not paying to watch it theres got to be a million things to do with two hours then watch this movie    this is the harshest review ive ever given and felt compelled to voice my disappointment and frustration with how bad this movie is
Mar 10 2023,positive,its not my favorite but i actually liked the the movie i came here after watching ant man quantumania and i cant wrap my mind around how that has an 80 audience score but this one was trashed people need to rate objectively and put aside their political agendas
Mar 9 2023,positive,let me start by saying that this film is a mixed bag on the one hand it has some strong performances impressive visuals and exciting action sequences on the other hand it suffers from some pacing issues a lack of character development and an overall lack of originality    the plot follows carol danvers played by brie larson a former us air force pilot who becomes the powerful superhero captain marvel along the way she discovers secrets about her past and teams up with a young nick fury played by samuel l jackson to stop an alien invasion one of the films strengths is its portrayal of carol danvers brie larson delivers a solid performance as the titular hero and her chemistry with samuel l jackson is one of the highlights of the film the action sequences are also welldone with some impressive cgi and choreography    however the film suffers from a lack of character development particularly with regards to the supporting cast many of the characters feel underdeveloped and onedimensional and their motivations are often unclear additionally the films pacing feels off at times with certain scenes feeling rushed or unnecessary another issue with the film is its lack of originality it follows many of the same beats as other superhero films and its storyline and themes feel familiar and predictable    overall captain marvel is a decent superhero movie that has its moments of entertainment however it falls short of being a truly great film due to its lack of originality and underdeveloped characters if youre a fan of the marvel cinematic universe then youll likely enjoy it but dont expect it to break any new ground
Mar 5 2023,neutral,it is not really worth buying
Mar 2 2023,negative,in this ruckus romp kyrsten sinema plays captain marvel the sassy blonde dont say boo to me super hero thats too busy on her phone right now to acknowledge what the other super heroes are talking about but who needs to worry about avenger drama when youre living your best life not this girl with her no fucks given necklace from etsy two thumbs up a stinky asshole
Mar 2 2023,positive,they ruined the marvel character marvell and i think ronin should have had a bigger part in the movie
Feb 25 2023,positive,when everything about your film is good except the main character there is a major problem carol danvers is unlikeable stale and not funny while i really like the story and the kreeskrull war young nick fury is a blast and the 90s theme is inherently retro and tubular it does not forgive the performance of the lead
Feb 24 2023,negative,not that great and certainly not the way to handle a character of this nature
Feb 23 2023,positive,dont understand all the hate i really enjoyed the movie the final scene could have been a bit longer but thats it good movie
Feb 23 2023,negative,horrible movie  horrible acting horrible sound quality nothing at all to like about this
Feb 21 2023,positive,solid and gets better with more viewings
Feb 21 2023,positive,captain marvel is a 2019 actionscifi film directed by anna boden and ryan fleck and starring brie larson as the titular character the movie is set in the 1990s and follows carol danvers a kree warrior who discovers her true identity and learns to harness her powers in a fight against the shapeshifting skrulls    one of the strongest aspects of the movie is brie larsons performance as carol danvers she brings a sense of depth and complexity to the character making her more than just a typical superhero the supporting cast is also strong with standout performances from samuel l jackson as nick fury and ben mendelsohn as talos the leader of the skrulls    the films visuals are also impressive the action scenes are wellchoreographed and exciting with the use of cgi blending seamlessly with the liveaction footage the cinematography by ben davis is striking with a mix of highcontrast lighting and wide shots that help to emphasize the scale of the action    however the film does have some weaknesses the plot can feel convoluted at times with a lot of exposition needed to set up the world and characters additionally the films use of 90s nostalgia can feel forced with some references feeling more like product placement than organic storytelling    the films musical score by pinar toprak is solid but not particularly memorable the direction by boden and fleck is competent but the films pacing can feel uneven particularly in the first act    overall captain marvel is an entertaining and visually stunning actionscifi film with a standout performance from brie larson while it may not be the most original or tightlyplotted movie in the marvel cinematic universe it is a worthy addition to the franchise and a welcome introduction to the character of captain marvel
Feb 20 2023,positive,its just really boring the effects are nice though
Feb 19 2023,positive,i think the narrative structure of this film turns a lot of people off to it but theres a lot of heart in this film someone being told they cant and they overcome peoples expectations and then some
Feb 18 2023,neutral,i understand why people dont like brie larson but the movie isnt that bad its not that good either tbh its not really essential to watch you could literally skip this movie and you wouldnt miss much    just remember theres skrulls and a cat scarred nick furys face
Feb 17 2023,positive,after a 5 and a half year streak of good movies from the mcu this one is just really mediocre
Feb 17 2023,positive,i loved everything about it
Feb 17 2023,positive,it was okay not the best but defo not the worst
Feb 15 2023,positive,people like to count this movie out but this was a great origin story
Feb 15 2023,negative,all of the grace and good acting possessed by a plank of wood plus a deeply flawed plot make for a terrible movie
Feb 11 2023,neutral,brie larson is pretty good in the role i think she couldve been more likable but the movie is very strange as it kind of feels like it theres a lot of things going against it with a not really good finale and shes too powerful and is never met with a match but a pretty fun movie with some pretty good sequences 510
Feb 9 2023,negative,captain marvel is not a horrible film but captain marvel is definitely one of those films that youre not really looking forward to rewatching it just seems very bland to the mcu and it doesnt feel like its connected i think that bree larson could do a better job if she wanted to i really feel like the film has all the aspects and capability of being great but i just feel like captain marvel has never been done correctly and i dont know if she ever will be im very nervous about the sequel but we will see you later on this year
Feb 8 2023,negative,bad acting terrible writing not entertaining  everything wrong with modern super hero movies
Feb 5 2023,negative,my problem with this film is that carol had no growth  it was just some events that happened and the no emotions thing is a bit of a stretch but there was still very few emotional moments that made me shed a tear or made me smile although i did smile when it was over my overall thought on is this not wanted film is it had so much potential but then ended up a disney cash grab
Feb 4 2023,negative,yet another super hero transitioned into a an over entitled woman with no extraordinary characteristics other than being a woman  dont bother watching
Feb 3 2023,positive,not a bad film at all it just had a lot more potential if some things were tweaked     there is a flashback sequence of carol being discriminated against for being a girl one of the scenes is her ignoring her dads warnings and then getting yelled at for ignoring him and crashing her gokart she gives the camera this look that says im getting yelled at cause im a girl and i unironically laugh so hard at this no youre being yelled at because you ignored your dad and couldve hurt yourself i love that scene so much
Jan 30 2023,positive,it was good but shouldve come sooner in the mcu
Jan 22 2023,positive,its a little disjointed but the setting and secondary characters help propel it to better than average
Jan 20 2023,negative,captain brick on its crusade to save the universe  not a good movie and not a good marvel movie there are reasons why the hero of this flick gets sidelined with the sequel marvels whoever will care about that one
Jan 17 2023,negative,do not watch no charakter development hates all man it seems
Jan 15 2023,negative,i remember i disliked this movie but dont have energy to rewatch it again and write all of my pain points the one thing you need to know     you will be disappointed
Jan 13 2023,negative,ive given this review two stars and thats purely for the visuals brie larson is as lifeless and compelling as a brick with a superhero what makes them iconic is they have weaknesses and they show moments of pure raw emotion there is absolutely nothing likeable about larsons portrayal as captain america visuals as mentioned are great and was the only thing that kept me turning this movie off
Jan 12 2023,positive,this movie is a good mix of humor action and story i loved getting to know captain marvel and her story
Jan 11 2023,negative,brie larson should stick to playing evil and mean characters it comes to her naurally xd     the movie was one of the worst mcu one ever
Jan 8 2023,negative,one of the top 3 contenders for worst marvel film to date
Jan 6 2023,positive,not terrible but not much reason to watch it again solid middleoftheroad marvel film which makes it all the more disappointing because it couldve been so much more
Jan 5 2023,positive,samuel l jackson is the best part of this film the deaging of him and coulson is cool to see jude law gives a good performance too while brie larson gets a bad reputation shes decent in this film the film has some good moments and is funny at times the girl power moments are pretty cringey and the story is abit weak its definitely not going to be in the top 15 of marvel movies but its definitely not the worst it was critiqued harshly back in 2019 but compared to the phase 4 marvel films that have come out since it holds up well enough and is worth watching during a mcu binge
Jan 4 2023,neutral,an average and unnecessary marvel movie with an arrogant main character that lacks any charisma and has unoriginal powers
Dec 29 2022,negative,disliked it useless character not needed in marvel universe
Dec 22 2022,positive,good movie nice action scenes and plot the twist at the ending is nice also
Dec 20 2022,positive,i loved all of the references to the 90s i love origin stories and felt this was pretty good i was left with questions about the plot but the cast made this enjoyable hidden references to other characters and tying movies together is what i love the most about the franchise it is a movie that ive watched several times and will watch again in the future
Dec 18 2022,negative,not worth a movie the character is not well developed the acting is mediocre and the effects are not great either only the story is acceptable and make it less of a pain to watch
Dec 16 2022,negative,the writing is the true villain of this story they go in trying to be a strong feminist film when they make the female lead into a boring and overpowered hero too many 90s references and pandering to the audience get annoying over time brie larsons mostly stale acting hurts the film as well when she is surrounded by such amazing talent such as samuel l jackson and ben mendelsohn a disappointing entry for the mcu leading into endgame
Dec 15 2022,negative,the marvel formula was pretty tired at  this point but atleast they had some flawssetbacks captain marvel had none of this and also the actress was insufferable just to top it off
Dec 14 2022,negative,shes just so obnoxious as a character that i ended up rooting for the other side  a raging narcissist who assaults people randomly is not a hero
Dec 14 2022,neutral,i had to recently rewatch this to really get my head wrapped around the movie i think for me the first time i couldnt really say anything because the movie was so wooden and predictable there were times where the movie was just so cheesy for example when they show brie larson dancing and singing in a flashback it felt extremely forced and cheesy i just couldnt buy the scene it felt like brie was trying just way too hard to be silly and goofy now that ive seen how she conducts herself in real life it makes sense because she is actually very stern and nonhumorous so the parts where they try to make her a likable hangout friend it doesnt work because she isnt that and cant pull it off in a scene overall the movie had some great introductions to characters like the skrulls but if im to be honest it was more of a redbox film as long as nothing else looked better that weekend
Dec 12 2022,neutral,refreshing new character and great cast but the story dragged
Dec 9 2022,negative,i avoided seeing this one when it came out because of all the drama surrounding it but i had the flu so i finally got caught up on some gaps in my mcu viewing  it was about as bad as they said it was  brie larsen just has little to no charisma and gave a wooden performance  her character was too emotional in her actions as several characters rightly pointed out but showed far too little emotion in her facial expressions  she kept trying to deliver cheeky quips but they all fell flat  overall it was still an entertaining movie but it was the secondary characters that carried it along
Dec 9 2022,positive,started out solid and just slowly went down was disappointed the acting is ok overall brie larson just never became charming like iron man or had the stoic presence of captain america instead she just was boring and ok this for me was the biggest problem she just never had any chemistry with any of the other cast who turned in ok to good performances the closest was with jackson but even that was hit or miss most of the time and in a origin story film about this character that is a major problem the expose got way too much in the middle of the film also the cinematography is alright the ending gets ridiculous and way too over the top along with some uninspired scifi settings the desert is forgetful the music is not that good which surprised me mainly because the generic superhero score is fine but their are some weird pop songs in this that just dont work very odd choices that just dont mix well the editing is above average but it felt like the film had too much too it almost in terms of ideas and as the film kept going it just started to drag this leads to a subpar pacing that by the last 20 minutes i just wanted it to end because i was just getting bored the special effects are just ok there is way too much cgi and nothing really pops in this the effects on jackson though were good i have to say  overall it was just ok but i cant really recommend this to anyone outside of jackson fans for his solid performance everything else is forgettable and not worth the investment
Dec 9 2022,negative,bri larson wooden and boring shes got talent and she was good in some of her early work she just doesnt have enough chops to add life to a poorly written character her character is not interesting because shes got no flaws or character arch to speak of samuel l jackson was fun but couldnt carry this movie
Dec 7 2022,negative,not good at all  brie larson is not enjoyable to watch
Dec 7 2022,negative,im generally a big fan of all the marvel movies however my son warned me about this one  he said dont bother she is a terrible actress  the only redeeming value of the movie was samuel jackson he is always good  brie larsons acting ability is akin to watching paint dry on a wall  she looks somewhere between bored and pissed of nearly the entire movie  well thats two hours of my life that i will never get back
Dec 5 2022,negative,honestly the story of marvell and all the awesomeness leading to ms marvel and the overall storywhy change it the stories were loved for a reason stay closer to the source material and you will find a winner people dont just remember these tales for nostalgia these stick because they are great stories
Dec 3 2022,positive,its not a perfect movie but its fun talos is cool nick fury is cool agent coulson obviously is the coolest character in the mcu so its great fun to see him again lashana lynch as maria rambeau is terrific
Dec 2 2022,negative,complete waste of time if you want to see an actual good movie just go watch aqua man its way more worth your time never been that bored for 2 hours and 4 minutes
Dec 1 2022,negative,literally cannot remember one thing that happened in this movie very forgettable
Nov 30 2022,negative,i didnt have fun watching the movie i went to the cinema just because it was between avengers infinity war and avengers end game
Nov 25 2022,negative,i would rate this higher because sam and nostalgia of the 90s saved it but its just not good
Nov 24 2022,negative,boring and terrible writting please dont watch it if you like superheroes movies this is a carnival of mistakes
Nov 19 2022,negative,from the 90s looking scifi in the first act to shallow characters story and message its all a huge mess dont waste your time with this movie
Nov 16 2022,positive,meh its fine solid midtier marvel film all of the positive and negative hype around it is hyperbole personally i believe that theres actually was potential for a really good film here but you can just feel the disney corporates dialing down the interesting elements and forcing it to stick to safe formulas so in that way its disappointing the acting is okay the visuals are competent the 80s callbacks and cat are fun
Nov 16 2022,positive,not as bad as people make it seem but its quite forgettable
Nov 16 2022,positive,i love this movie sooooo freaking much it is the best marvel movie in the world in fact thanks to captain marvel the movie has given me a second chance to rethink and like all superhero movies across hollywood     i really like carol danvers she is my number 1 favourite superhero of all time because she really different from most superheroes she wear my favourite colours red and gold shes extremely powerful and she freaks glows omg she doesnt wear a cape behind her back which means she been listening to edna mode advice lol and even those lot of people say she has no emotions i think your all wrong we literally see her cry at the end were the supreme intelligence captured her and she was remembering her childhood and how she stepped up when things got difficult for her weve seen her laugh multiple times and smile     there is honestly so much positive things to say about this movie and only positive thing so i would like to say thank you to brie larson marvel studios and everyone who work really hard on this movie it really did deserve billions of dollars and nothing more but positivity and success     i cant wait to see more of captain marvel in the marvels and in future moviesshows keep up the great work
Nov 15 2022,positive,at just over 2 hours this straight forward origin story is pretty standard but overall it was satisfying it felt shorter than its runtime due to a steady  consistent flow
Nov 14 2022,positive,very underrated movie its good fun and a joy to watch
Nov 14 2022,positive,probably the most formulaic marvel movie of all time not bad by any measure but nothing to rave about it had its fun moments where it was good but would suddenly turn around to disrespect andor misrepresent important characters like fury and marvell
Nov 14 2022,negative,i really do not see why this project flopped so badly given its circumstances it had great potential but instead brought the mcu one of the worst plothandled stories it really made no sense and its overuse in cgi was boring the first half of the film was an origin of carol danvers when in reality it was just a simulation the character of carol is obnoxious and forgettable and i did not find this film to be enjoyable at all in addition its final fight scene was by far the worst in a superhero filmif you even want to call it a final fight
Nov 12 2022,positive,the movie is very good and interesting i like it very much i hope marvel studios will continue to produce more great movies like this
Nov 11 2022,negative,awful unfriendly protagonist and poor screenplay
Nov 11 2022,positive,the fact that they did away with the original backstory is what bothered me the most overall the movie was fun to watch larson could do a better job emoting her dialogues thus 3 
Nov 7 2022,positive,i thought it was an original creative funny very good engaging scifi movie and fit in well with the mcu it was a thrilling and thoroughly entertaining introduction to the captain  marvel character marvel character brie larson  samuel l jackson  lashana lynch annette benning and the rest of the cast were all excellent and convincing in their roles its a lot of fun
Nov 3 2022,positive,its not that bad i very much liked it its a must watch
Nov 1 2022,positive,a great launch to the character with the right emphasis on avoiding the male gaze a true action superhero movie that isnt catering to men
Oct 26 2022,negative,one of the worst marvel movie i have seen come out of phase 3 brie larsons acting was similar to that of a cardboard same goes for her character of captain marvel who comes off as narcissistic and cocky
Oct 26 2022,positive,one of my favorite mcu movies  love how the skrulls surprise on multiple levels  and the concept of a device meant to help vers turning out to be a sort of muzzle is cool  i love larsons wry reactions throughout  lots of great characters
Oct 25 2022,negative,watched this movie and it was bad plot acting directing and all not really inspirational at all critics loved this movie but the fans hate it there must be some kind of agenda with these critics
Oct 25 2022,negative,nothing special the kind of standard marvel fare you expect   but low review due a truly unrelatable and quite unlikable main character no real story arch no challenge or struggle everything is easy and comes out in their favour  this type of writing seems to be the hollywood standard now and underwhelming  unenjoyable experience
Oct 25 2022,negative,in my oppinion one of the 3 worst marvel movies first time watching was interesting but watching it the second time was just pain just a bad written story only thing i liked was goose i definetly wont watch this movie ever again
Oct 24 2022,positive,i liked it a fun origin story so thats why fury wears an eye patch
Oct 24 2022,neutral,not so much the actors fault it just feels so shoved last minute just so they can have the character in endgame
Oct 24 2022,positive,incredible movie brings a very great empowerment through the warrior woman who saved the world lost her memory but still didnt give up what she believed was right
Oct 24 2022,negative,bad acting bad writing cringe and more cringe
Oct 24 2022,negative,when you read jim satrlins sagas its impossible to enjoy this movie
Oct 22 2022,negative,horrible disrespectful with the original material and the great jim starlins sagas
Oct 22 2022,positive,standard marvel movie ok characters ok plot  im hoping we get to see more krull stuff
Oct 22 2022,positive,great action movie and addition to mcu larson and jackson have great chemistry dont let negative reviews from trolls deter you from watching this one especially if youre a fan of the mcu
Oct 21 2022,negative,brie larson was terrible that acting was horrific cant believe they are deciding to make another movie for this series
Oct 21 2022,negative,a ham fisted superhero origin film with an unlikeable main character that brims with all of the usual tropes and macguffins the audience has come to expect from the mcu template
Oct 20 2022,negative,this was just bad im a huge fan of superhero films so id go see this eitherway but i kind of wish i didnt my partner fell asleep during it which she never does
Oct 20 2022,negative,its probably the only mcu film i couldnt finished  it was just dull and lost my interest about an hour in not even sam could keep me watching
Oct 20 2022,negative,pure brutal too powerful no real suspense or story and not a likeable character dont know how anyone can like it
Oct 19 2022,negative,one of the worse marvel films to date thor 2 is worse but at least has loki this one unnecessarily rewrites the mcu lore and ruins furys backstory instead
Oct 15 2022,positive,really liked this film loved the 90s nostalgia and loved fury getting more air time
Oct 15 2022,positive,this movie actually gives an excellent backstory with an unexpected twist that is connected in a right way to the avengers it never bores and maintains the extraordinary aspect that kept the movie enjoyable
Oct 14 2022,neutral,it was ok i was expecting more
Oct 13 2022,negative,i really tried to like this movie but the acting from the main character ruined it for me i recently rewatched the movie and the emotionless acting makes you feel bad for the costars
Oct 10 2022,positive,is this the best mcu film  no  is it the worst  hell no    the 90s theme is a bit heavy handed   yes we get it its the 90s  but over all this is a fun film with good characters   i loved that the end of the film is a female power fantasy and not a redressed male one  men and women are different we have different exp and different voices  carol learned to not care what others expectations are of her and not accept the limits others tried to put on her and that rang true the same way i could believe steve rodgers power fantasy of becoming the best version of himself through physical improvement    go carol  higher further faster baby
Oct 9 2022,negative,the direction is solid and the performances from the likes of brie larson and samuel l jackson is flawless and there are some inventive action sequences and moments the overall narrative is weak and uninspiring
Oct 5 2022,negative,its an extravagant film never seen before story very unique story its a tatti story with a very strong story arc the character is also tatti i liked the film very much
Oct 2 2022,negative,this movie forced me to take a hiatus from watching marvel films  poorly written characters no character development wooden acting lame action scenes slow poorly contrived plot i could go on  sadly i think this film serves as a setback for female superheroes who could be written and performed so much better than this
Oct 1 2022,positive,not sure how people really dont like it but it has great action scenes really good acting and a memorable storyline top ten mcu movie imo
Sep 26 2022,negative,i sat through the whole thing looking for something that would redeem the movie post credits i was still looking
Sep 26 2022,negative,mediocre acted in a movie that was just allaround boring
Sep 24 2022,negative,one of the worst marvel films at least they implemented some nice effects
Sep 24 2022,negative,boring  its definitely doesnt worth watching it seems they got wirse year by year
Sep 23 2022,neutral,captain marvel is technically proficient but lacks quite a lot in the storytelling writing and character department  its passable not the worst movie out there by any stretch but it isnt good and certainly isnt great  to start one of the biggest problems with the film is the character of carol danverscaptain marvel  it pains me to have to say this but im not a sexist cue sounds like something a sexist would say i just enjoy well written characters  to be more specific im drawn to flaws and perseverance in characters  a good comparison here might be the character of superman how do you make an infinitely strong and seemingly flawless character interesting  its been done for sure but its inherently a difficult task  why  a character who cant gain strength or overcome something internalexternal or otherwise see failure is well just boring  to put it another way characters who begin their journey weak end their journey strong ignorant then wise unethical then ethical and so on  carol begins her journey with amnesia and then regains her memory she is weak because she doesnt remember and then strong because she does  unless the struggle of dealing with amnesia and getting through that is written well and with depth eg we as the audience knew carol from before saw her fall and championed her struggle out of it it ends up being nothing more than a caricature of good character development less a rewarding character arch and more like just a plot thread  another comparison to draw from is the character of ellen ripley alien franchise  specifically her development through the films alien and aliens  in the beginning of aliens we see the character of ripley struggling with ptsd from the events of the first film alien  she is mocked belittled stripped of her rank and status and generally we as the audience see her in a very low place  through the events of the film we watch her grow show resiliency and by the end shes not only proved herself but shes overcome her worst fears and become a true hero  ellen ripley a female protagonist from as far back as 1979 is in my opinion a better hero and role model than this iteration of carol danvers ever dreamed of being in 2019 and naturally a better written character  i dont think ill ever really know why this kind of characterization is at least portrayed as being better than a character like ripley  i love diversity in characters but we need to start demanding better written diversity  ps i only even bring up diversity and captain marvels gender because its clear however wellintentioned that diversity and gender played a big role in this film its marketing and reception  bring on more female characters more diversity but for  sake give them wellwritten stories to inhabit wellwritten characters to embody and a journey worth taking  more ripleysless danvers  im still hopeful  there are several talented writers out there  hopefully some of them are involved in captain marvel 2
Sep 23 2022,positive,my favourite marvel movie love carol danvers  shes such a badass enjoy how we get to see the story before the avengers happened
Sep 22 2022,negative,the most boring mcu ever
Sep 20 2022,negative,no character development in this dull superhero flick
Sep 20 2022,neutral,not that bad a movie but not worth a second watching one of the weakest in the mu and no brie i dont want you back as captain marvel you are a great actress and can do better than playing a mediocre heroine
Sep 19 2022,negative,a bit meh  i wanted to like it but past the basic pretty colours it was quite bare
Sep 19 2022,positive,best of moviestv series collection
Sep 18 2022,positive,a totally awesome mcu entry clever hilarious surprising with some great origin stories of important characters and it makes you look at yourself and question your assumptions and default biases  i dont understand the low scores sounds like something besides the movieplot is driving them see this movie its incredible
Sep 17 2022,negative,wooow this is a baaad movie worst lead character in the entire marvel universe
Sep 17 2022,neutral,unmemorable movie theres a little of top gun green lantern that said it all and worst of all a little of marvel magic the protagonist is monodimensional and we know how cool good fun she is by what other character say about her she never acts cool fun or anything else a big shame
Sep 16 2022,negative,aside from the most woodenactor in the world  the cgi is laughable at times
Sep 15 2022,negative,brie larson put too much of her own obtuse personality into the film
Sep 14 2022,positive,yes i know the anti cpt marvel diatribe but as an original marvel comics fan i found it enjoyable   a bit too much of todays commentary on society but all in all an enjoyable film
Sep 13 2022,positive,a movie just as good as the other origin stories for characters in the mcu brie delivers a good and solid carol denvers with her military mannerisms and her background as a strong woman i would particularly do it differently about the way she gain her powers but its ok this is a universe where bruce banner shoots himself with gama radiation the hole kree nuclea very good love jude law love gemma chan i dont like the way they led nick furys core i was expecting more of the serious samuel l jackson from the first phase but its nothing that destroyed the movie
Sep 13 2022,negative,wow i tried watching it expecting it to be rough but i didnt expect it to be that bad lol
Sep 13 2022,negative,the plot is weak not a huge fan of this movie i really wanted to like it but marvel flopped their first attempt and thats okay please marvel give us a good movie next time
Sep 13 2022,negative,not the worst mcu movie but it wasnt anywhere close to being a fun enjoyable marvel movie the plot moved slowly and it was predictable brie larsons acting and the writing of her character ended up making a boring dislikable character with little to no character development on the other hand samuel l jackson as nick fury once again on screen carried the show as a side character he made the movie somewhat better than it was i hated one of the scenes with nick fury and a cat not going to spoil the movie but come on they could have done a lot better one of the reasons this movie didnt work is because it was trying to be too many things at once and it couldnt stick the landing
Sep 12 2022,negative,an utter bore bereft of creativity or sincerity the first true signal for marvels new direction warring with fans by sacrificing genuine creativity and entertainment for political messaging and fanblaming brie larson is another nepotistic hollywood child only one with stiff wooden acting and a massive sense of entitlement it bleeds through her portrayal the character is vapid and lifeless the story is paper thin the villain might be the worst in the mcus notoriously lackluster line up the movie is garbage a waste of hundreds of millions of dollars to produce something worse than forgettable people starve while movies like this are made wow what a hero
Sep 12 2022,negative,this movie was horrible  carol was wooden uninteresting and went through no personal growth  the one thing she did do was go from powerful to more powerful without gaining any appreciation for the power she was given  this movie constantly shoved you cant do it because youre a girl in the audiences face so carol could repeatedly slaaaay qweeeen without really facing any opposition  a character needs to get knocked down before they can get up better as a person as well as power  thor lost his hammer iron man was taken captive carolwhat  steals a guys jacket because he said smile more     ps i am a woman  sorry no male fragility here
Sep 12 2022,positive,i heard that this movie wasnt wellliked but it is actually a very fun movie with a likable protagonist and everything my whole family had a great time i then found out that apparently the movie was reviewbombed by misogynists and the real polls showed that 80 of viewers enjoyed and recommended it and it was reflected in a successful box office run i wish i knew that sooner and didnt avoid it for so long
Sep 12 2022,negative,for all then noise this is an average and somewhat stereotypical hero origin story without much depth maybe one difference would be that the lead character is actually not expected to improve herself but rather realize that she was perfect all along which is a much less compelling narrative if you need to waste time and dont have anything else to watch this is something that can be seen to pass the time but certainly would not recommend you choose to do so especially if you have any other options
Sep 11 2022,neutral,super bland the only fun scenes are when carol  nick fury are having back  fourth discussions  the final battle carol has in space against the kree carol is probably the biggest marry sue to this day since besides the flashbacks where she has to act like a tough girl their is nothing else for us to latch onto her usually whenever a powerful superhero gets introduced we see they have a sensitive side to them like thor superman wanda etc their powers shouldnt be their identity i do however like how we get the skrulls introduced into the mcu due to how many interesting stories we can get from them in the future like secret invasion which can be interesting to see in live action
Sep 11 2022,negative,no good movie at all there was absolutely no character development it was interesting to see something of the scrull and kree but yeah thats all good i can say about it
Sep 9 2022,positive,interesting and with good characters its fun to watch
Sep 8 2022,neutral,was ok just not marvel
Sep 7 2022,negative,mediocre at best    zero character development or growth throughout the movie danvers starts her journey unbelievably overpowered and just has to realize how awesome she is there is a single moment where she is captured and i thought it was going to be a growth moment for her cue im just a girl background music as she beats the snot out of every skrull with both hands restrained    theres no stakes or tension it becomes obvious very quickly that there is no way that captain marvel is in any danger and i know shes the protagonist and the good guys always win but the writers need to learn how to create tension cm just strolls from one fight to the next and doesnt even break a sweat and the way they turn nick furys eye into a joke at the end of the movie was nothing more than a mean spirited jab at a seriously traditional masculine character
Sep 7 2022,positive,i enjoyed this movie i thought it was funny and the chemistry was strong ive rewatched it several times and i dont get the criticisms the acting is fine the chemistry between larson and jackson is great the origin story though typically scant on rational thought but need i mention being bitten by a radioactive spider still unfolds nicely throughout the movie and she shows much more than one facial expression im pretty critical and i dont get the criticism at all time well spent
Sep 5 2022,negative,horrible film i dont know which was worse the horrible script which thought it was clever and funny or the horrible acting by the lead actress who had one facial expression throughout i saw it once at the cinema wanted to walk out about halfway through due to boredom and never intend to ever watch this piece of trash ever again
Sep 5 2022,positive,  i watched it for its visual effects
Sep 4 2022,negative,the movie focuses more on the messaging rather than character development and fails at both
Sep 4 2022,negative,probably the lamest mcu movie so far thats what you get when the main character is so unlikable
Sep 3 2022,positive,brilliant casting  one of the best mcu films
Sep 3 2022,negative,just not that great passed time but thats about it watch any other marvel stuff besides early hulk lol
Sep 3 2022,positive,loved it great storyline loved the characters
Sep 2 2022,positive,good start to the marvel franchise
Sep 2 2022,negative,not a good story did not have a real part in the mcu storyline was just to make money instead of actually putting a good story and background to it could have been done a lot better
Sep 2 2022,negative,the main actress went out of her way to make sure this film never stood a chance with a significant portion of the fanbase but ignoring that the film itself is pretty dull larsons character isnt quite as obnoxious as the actress portraying her but the filmmakers give us nothing in terms of character development as others have noted her arc was that she was awesome all along and she just had to realize how awesome she always was vacuous and sad
Sep 2 2022,positive,brilliant film start to finish
Aug 31 2022,positive,i thought it was a fun movie the talos is cool and so is obviously sam l jackson the rest of the movie is like eh but still a great and fun time
Aug 30 2022,negative,probably one of the worst movies marvel has made brie larsons acting was horrible and the story went nowhere her origin story was the worst
Aug 28 2022,positive,good fun movie nothing too deep but entertaining
Aug 26 2022,negative,what makes me mad is i wrote a whole review last time about how i genuinely didnt like the movie and gave it 2 stars that fact they took it down after i spent the time to write it makes me feel spiteful im dropping it half a star for that
Aug 25 2022,negative,to be honest i dont like brie larsons captain marvel i hope its a problem isolated to this movie maybe it gets better when her stories have participation from other characters in the universe
Aug 25 2022,neutral,it was enjoyable it was cool seeing ronan and korath again didnt like how they made marvell a woman 25  ok
Aug 25 2022,positive,great marvel origin story really liked the chemistry between larson and jackson the twist was unexpected and added another layer of depth the movie ties into the wider mcu by setting up the avengers initiative but keeps its own identity i enjoyed it a lot especially goose
Aug 24 2022,negative,wastenof time and money  besides the weak story and mediocre acting by all involved you cant get around brie larsens wooden performance  she spends the movie doing her best not to have any facial expression  it seems her entire goal of the film is to try to reenact tom cruises role in top gun without the charm or likability  which is unfortunate becuse having seen brie larson in the tv show community i was really looking forward to her taking on this role  she plays the part with extreme hostility for the character and contempt for the audience  she seems to double down on her instead  unikeability in her subsequent roles as capitain marvel in the subsequent avenger movies  granted the entire concept of how capitan marvel beicame a superhero because in the movie was ridiculous and how nick fury got his eye patch was disrespectful to his character brie larson didnt have a ton to work with her lack of talent made and mediocre movie dreadful  even if you were to ignore her unpleasant demeanor and selfrighteous interviews the concept of captain marvel brings very little to the avengers story and miss larsons betrayal of captain marvel nearly ruins the entire franchise   to summarize ms larsons acting was a d at best the remaining cast was a c to a b in parts  the overall storyline was c and the special effects were a b  i rank this movie below the second thor movie  by far the worst in the marvel universe
Aug 23 2022,negative,absolutely horrible movie
Aug 23 2022,positive,a pretty good origin movie for captain marvel really looking forward to a sequel i dont know why so many people had a problem with brie larsons acting i thought it was great i guess people didnt like how stern and stoic her character was although if this were a man i dont think anyone would be complaining about it i mean she was less serious than say batman at least she wasnt completely above smiling
Aug 23 2022,negative,some of the mcu movies have been mediocre iron man 2 iron man 3 thor 2 thor 4 black widow  this is the first movie that actually reduced by appreciation of the marvel movies  it just feels they went in an opposite direction from the majority of marvel movies with this one  they are there to entertain and mix in little tidbits from the comics that are easily recognizable  this one just dumbed down the very concept of captain marvel and ms marvel into a take on a controversial feminist run of the comics  it just felt they didnt want us to enjoy the movie just annoy the audience and burn away some good will
Aug 23 2022,negative,wth was mcudisney thinking or smoking when they approved this idea  the captain marvel comic is not a good comic it does not sell well so i am not sure what made them think this was a good idea  brie larson had the same dumb look the whole movie which was the same in 21 jump street  at least in 21 jump street she was suppose portray a dumb teenager but what was the excuse in this film  the editing was on par with the rest of high dollar mcu movies  the writing and direction of the movie was just bad with bad jokes bad dialog and a very bad plot
Aug 23 2022,negative,if it wasnt wedged between infinity war and end game i would never have seen it brie cant act and she comes across more as a villain than hero
Aug 23 2022,negative,way to powerful dripping feminism and not true to the comics
Aug 22 2022,negative,very preachy and full of itself felt like i was being lectured by the class knowitall
Aug 21 2022,negative,awful movie do not waste your time
Aug 21 2022,negative,the beginning of the end for the mcu right here an insufferable protagonist leading in a film that really doesnt matter at all to the overall mcu story she could have popped up in end game with an extra two lines of dialog and that would have been a better intro than this mess of a movie   disney marvel really has no idea how to handle their female heroes when they become the main protagonists as they basically behave in a manner that gets called toxic masculinity when men do similar things
Aug 20 2022,negative,simply awful ive never been so disappointed with a characters development before
Aug 19 2022,negative,yeeeeeeeeeeeah well actually no
Aug 19 2022,negative,main actor failed her performance movie was generic and predictable
Aug 19 2022,negative,a brainless female empowerment hero movie it only looks good but its neither smart or funny there is no emotion behind tha character
Aug 19 2022,positive,the first mcu film with a female lead the plot is interesting and the conflict between kree and skrull can recall the events of colonization that took place in history there is a lot of girlpower in the film which at times makes the protagonists character a bit unsympathetic very nice is instead nick fury who comes up with funny gags although audiences hated this film i find it enjoyable and entertaining
Aug 19 2022,negative,i would have like to have seen the original male protagonist before being introduced to the female version as per original comic books i believe the storyline could have been a little bit different as well
Aug 19 2022,negative,boring and the main actress was so bland no challenges to overcome boring
Aug 18 2022,negative,simply a mess    bad writing forced social messaging pushing the current female power agenda    a character that is not well liked in comic books was a bad idea and making her an overpowered mary sue    the marvel movie universe really stopped after endgame now its just about social justice forced into movies and shows
Aug 18 2022,negative,stoic acting and predictible plot filled with common feminist tropes and unrealistic character responses
Aug 17 2022,negative,its not that the movie is terrible its just not good many movies get away with this by being funny in how bad the movie is but this is not that the movie is about one step away from being terrible though     the plot premise is good enough but falls flat never flat then you have disney making a character designed to be very over powered as a social commentary and just roll with it like it just makes sense she is really the only super hero they didnt lower the power of and it really shows how desperate they tried to make the character awesome     then the acting also fell very flat yes yes we all know the main actress is bad her social media posts and all that prove she is not a good person and disney in their time of pushing current social commentary hard mixing her into the mix was a recipe for disaster just waiting to happen and the reviews here show that     like i said its not a good movie but it isnt terrible i would say easily the worst though of all the marvel movies and shows how this got a second movie i will never know it wasnt any better either we just skip these movies in our marvel binges and try to ignore the very cheesy scenes in the last avengers movies
Aug 17 2022,positive,i loved the movie and the 90s feel it was a great romp
Aug 17 2022,positive,a great watch that i keep coming back to every now and then it has some crucial introductionscharacters that link the mcu to the past and the future and thats what i love about the movie
Aug 17 2022,negative,overhyped and generic was lucky to be released in between two avengers movies
Aug 15 2022,negative,the lack of a charismatic main character and a messy plot and storytelling make this one of the worst movies in the mcu with one the most forgettable villains in the franchise  410
Aug 15 2022,negative,this was bad i am not a big fan of super hero movies but wow this one was a stinker
Aug 13 2022,negative,a hero you want to dislike shes just mean and above everyone else
Aug 12 2022,positive,captain marvel is a quality movie despite popular opinion saying otherwise worst standalone mcu film of all time does nobody remember iron man 2 or thor the dark world brie larson does a relatively decent job playing the role of carol danvers captain marvel and the movie doesnt come across as boring for the majority of the film the start to middle parts of the movie do feel slow but the pace does begin to pick up     solid movie  710 355
Aug 11 2022,neutral,very mid movie worst mcu solo movie by far
Aug 11 2022,negative,the titular character came off as bland and boring
Aug 8 2022,positive,well the movie plot was ok but its boring its not that good and not that bad just boring 610
Aug 7 2022,negative,the plot of this movie was quite incoherent the movie had no direction and was defiantly a disappointment since captain marvel is one of my favorite super heros
Aug 5 2022,negative,i didnt even know who brie larson was before this movie and now after turning this awful movie off after 20 torturous minutes i dont want to know who she is ever again byeeee
Aug 3 2022,positive,enjoyable could have been better but decent
Aug 3 2022,positive,the story plays out as it should and a few surprises an excellent 2nd movie in the mcu timeline 
Aug 1 2022,positive,a good very good movie but could be better
Jul 31 2022,positive,great if not excellent as good as or better than every other solo origin movie in the mcu with the possible exceptions of dr strange and if you count it guardians    troll responses from sensitive whiners are just that people loved this movie while offended internet warriors hated it so much that they tried to change that perception    it didnt work a billion dollars is a billion dollars
Jul 31 2022,positive,i loved brie larsons performance this is one of my favorite marvel movies also goose is the goat
Jul 31 2022,positive,one of the best marvel movies ever made  larson carried the movie  solid cast acting and writing
Jul 28 2022,negative,such a boring character
Jul 28 2022,negative,screenplay was wrong since the very beginning where a golden character legacy of marvell could be a women but at least powerful not a weak old lady last enemy could be defeated by hawkeye
Jul 28 2022,positive,captain marvel when i first watched it didnt sit with me too well but after watching it again i can definitely say that my opinion on the movie has changed and it has grown on me a bit i like brie larson in the role a bit more than i use to but i still dont think its a great it i really liked the dynamic between fury and danvers the plot twist did catch me by surprise and the action was pretty solid but a lot of the characters felt kinda stale and 2 dimensional and didnt help the plot very much but this film in my opinion doesnt deserve as much hate as it gets or has gotten
Jul 27 2022,negative,the must forgettable movie in the whole franchise with my most hated character in it easy to say that this was not the greatest film but more specifically not the best characters besides samuel l jackson captain marvel is such an egotistical unlikeable character that is even worse in avengers endgame bad movie
Jul 25 2022,positive,this movie is very special to me not only because of the participation of brie and samuel but the stories of captain marvel are amazing and the movie itself is very captivating
Jul 25 2022,positive,it doesnt really bring much to the table the main plot is quite generic good cgi
Jul 23 2022,positive,although being reviewbombed by misogynist bigots captain marvel still isnt all that good brie larson may have needed more time to figure things out and some cringey writing definitely needed to be revised it maintains its four stars due to a compelling plot and a fantastic performance from samuel l jackson as nick furybut we already knew that
Jul 19 2022,neutral,captain marvel just needs more indepth character watching her in the story is just uninspiring because the story is boring and unengaging the only good thing about this movie is young nicks furry and the plot twist of the skrull
Jul 19 2022,positive,this movie is the long kiss goodnight with geena davis but in space  a brilliant mcu origin movie  i cant wait for captain marvel 2 the marvels
Jul 18 2022,positive,best thing about this movie was the special effects i wanted to give it lower marks because i personally just dont like the main lead but i have to be fail and balanced and this movie was actually not as bad as most people make it out to be i get that we all dont like the main actress but we cant destroy the film over it it was a mediocre film and the effects were good it wasnt a bad movie it just wasnt good plot wasnt great acting was mediocre
Jul 18 2022,negative,captain marvel was just awful the leads acting was as dry as a over cooked piece of toast and as entertaining as watching paint dry  the writing was not great this character seems so forced down our throats and so op to further force it that it was hard to be interested maybe focusing on better writing will make this character and future movies more like able this was awful
Jul 18 2022,positive,another great marvel movie
Jul 17 2022,negative,it was boring predictable and brie larson cant act
Jul 16 2022,positive,decent but very normal forumula
Jul 16 2022,positive,this hohum superhero flick is fastpaced but follows the formula a bit too much  fast cut action scenes set to girlrock anthems was fun enough for me
Jul 15 2022,negative,an absolute snoozer of an action  buddycop movie samuel l jackson does well here but bri larson is given absolutely nothing to work with in this script and direction also the twist villain is absolutely pathetic
Jul 14 2022,negative,very cringe and disappointing
Jul 14 2022,positive,very enjoyable captain marvel kicks butt
Jul 13 2022,negative,smug self righteous overpowered girl hits things a lot nick fury loses his eye to a cat that about covers it
Jul 13 2022,positive,peoples hate for this movie is forced i love it and cant wait for the marvels 
Jul 12 2022,positive,ambitious well paced and surprising if you dont know the comics  does not disappoint
Jul 12 2022,negative,isnt the best but not the worst cant really remember much from the movie also which makes it doesnt feel as important the character itself is aight ig
Jul 11 2022,negative,boring bland with a forgettable villain and an even more forgettable plot with a main character that hates everything and has done absolutely nothing to deserve her powers mary sue alert big time
Jul 11 2022,negative,not a good movie the acting and cgi are horrific
Jul 10 2022,negative,snoozefest cant believe they butchered the kree vs skrull story potential
Jul 10 2022,positive,love this movie her struggle as a little girl is very touching  it set the tone for her resilient never give up character  my daughter found it inspiring and impowering  i enjoyed it immensely too lots of layers  its one of those films that benefits from multiple viewings  reading some reviews it seems a lot people didnt understand parts and havent given it a second chance  ive watched it six times so far twice at the cinema once on hbo three times on my bluray  enjoyed it every time  the younger versions of fury and coulson were tremendous the cat was hilarious  im currently loving ms marvel and i liked monica rambeau in wandavision too so im really looking forward to seeing them both team up with captain marvel in the marvels
Jul 10 2022,negative,the one star is for ben his story and character is way more interesting than brie larson and cap marvel 
Jul 9 2022,negative,eh it was kind of lame marvel was sort of a boring character
Jul 9 2022,positive,captain marvel is a classic mcu origin story using a familiar if overused formula that still manages to work here carol danversverscaptain marvel isnt the most compelling hero but brie larson delivers a solid performance in the title role seeing a young nick fury samuel l jackson is fun and adds to his character and coulsons brief return to the big screen is entertaining if not undercut by a minor twist the reveal of the true villains is fun and ben mendelsohns talos is funny and entertaining the return of ronin to the screen had potential but was cut short and his role was minimal jude laws yonrogg is uncompelling although seeing him get blasted by captain marvel is strangely satisfying though it has numerous issues captain marvel still does a good enough job introducing a new hero and making it funny enough to add enjoyment to the viewing
Jul 9 2022,positive,yeah this is better than cats
Jul 8 2022,positive,it was really good it was the first marvel movie i watch and it inspired me to keep watching them
Jul 7 2022,negative,boring the worst mcu movie ever
Jul 5 2022,negative,captain marvel didnt have a heroic character but came across as stuck up and holierthanthou
Jul 4 2022,negative,this was not a very good movie  like the original thor i did not care for anything that happened on the alien worlds  it was just kind of boring the movie was 30 minutes too long and it got a bit political for my liking  brie larson was not a good choice either she lacks the charisma for that role  emily blunt would have been a much better choice but if the producers thought she was too old they could have gone with natalie dormer who looks exactly like the comic book drawing  if there was any saving grace for the movie it was the fish out of water story taking place in the 1990s  sadly this part of the story is short and all too fleeting  it could have used more of this  this is one of only 2 marvel movies i do not own  only watch this if you are a completionist otherwise it can be skipped
Jul 4 2022,negative,the movie could have been better it was to introduce important characters to the mcu it did some of those introductions well but it lacked something else
Jul 3 2022,negative,whack movie super boring hopefully iman vellani can carry the sequel
Jul 2 2022,negative,worst marvel movie ever horrible writing and bad character development dont even bother
Jun 30 2022,negative,this is by far the worst  marvel film ive seen so far the character marvel and main actress are pure and simple just awful this was the first marvel film who had made me realise you know what not everything marvel produces is good
Jun 26 2022,neutral,please come up with original ideas
Jun 24 2022,negative,this is the worst mcu movie to me the story is so confusing and boring and there is no good humor involved brie larsons very bland character filled with girl power makes me want to cringe she clearly isnt fit for the main role of the movie as she shows no real emotions and depth to her character and also she is way too overpowered for my liking especially toward the end of the movie the villain is one of the most forgettable in the whole of mcu that i cant even remember his name minutes after i watched it samuel l jackson partially saves the movie from being absolute trash for me but the rest of the movie sucks if theres a girlled superhero movie that i want to watch id rather watch wonder woman a freaking dc film it shows captain marvel how good of a movie it was supposed to be
Jun 23 2022,positive,i love this film nothing bothers me i have no complaints about any of the mcu this film was put together soo good plot and story awsome top 7 films of all time others being nwh and dr strange and the multiverse of maddness ect
Jun 20 2022,negative,no character arc and no tension just another dull cgi mess from the marvel factory
Jun 16 2022,positive,i honestly believe this is one of the best mcu movies out there its probably around 15th and has a good plot and great cgi and pacing and its didnt feel rushed when i watched it and it was easy to understand and the way they introduced carol was great and its definitely one of my favourite back stories i genuinely believe that its rated this low because the the first mcu female lead movie based on a female character and also peoples general hate for brie larson which is disappointing because the movie is really good and i dont think people should have judged a moviecharacter because of their hate towards the actress
Jun 16 2022,neutral,possibly the first bad movie the mcu has ever put out
Jun 16 2022,negative,by far the worst mcu movie i had to suffer to watch it was so cringe and and tried too hard with female empowerment jessica jones did it alot better
Jun 16 2022,negative,that was a  terrible movie at first oh it was good but when i watched the second time oh there definitely makeing it bad
Jun 14 2022,negative,i honestly didnt think i could dislike brie larson any more than i already did until i watched this movie how is it possible for her to be so stuck up and full of herself at all times while being at best a dlist actress performance was beyond flat too bad the studio couldnt hire a double for her acting like they did for her hank hill situation
Jun 13 2022,positive,with all of the negative reviews and hate for the lead actress out there i was expecting the worst but samuel l jackson and brie larson work well together and i really enjoyed their performances
Jun 9 2022,positive,heavily underrated film i enjoyed it and it got me so interested a lot of people are just mad because she is op
Jun 6 2022,positive,i liked this movie i can watch it multiple times  i like the character ms marvel bree is hott  i hope to never see bree in short hair ever again though that was hideous
Jun 6 2022,negative,terrible movie no fun no good story no character building
Jun 6 2022,negative,a buddy cop type story where the two characters have little to no chemistry with each other and arent exactly likeable story wasnt interesting and telegraphed its ideas too hard for any reveal or interesting things to happen
Jun 4 2022,positive,really fun marvels take on a 90s action movie which wasnt a genre i expected them to tackle
Jun 3 2022,negative,whats there to say that hasnt already been said its obvious that this movie was slapped together quickly in order to shoehorn captain deus ex machina into avengers endgame and it shows the plot was all over the place and the lead characters performance was dull as dishwater    i can only commend this movie for the deaging technology they used on samuel l jackson which is second to none
Jun 1 2022,negative,another marvel movie that is just out of placehorrible and forced jokes were flat and a different actor or actress would of been nicetoo late now  the filming was bad alsoand the cgi was a little muchbudget cuts
Jun 1 2022,negative,exceedingly dull and poorly written
May 31 2022,positive,this is an average film as far as mcu output in my opinion not terrible by any means but not one i revisit unless im doing an entire mcurewatch others may find more enjoyment in it than i did so i recommend giving it a shot    i just created this account to show matt jarbo that i didnt have to prove i paid to see it in order to contribute to the audience score    subscribe to actual fandom and matt jarbo on youtube
May 28 2022,positive,i just dont like the plot enough to watch it again i also feel that brie larson didnt fit the character of captain marvel she may be a good actress but i wasnt able to see our main hero in her unfortunately
May 26 2022,positive,throughly enjoyed the movie
May 25 2022,positive,maybe it depends on me but i had the feeling this movie had no connection to the rest of the mcu except for the appearance of mick fury   but overall an okay movie but just kind of not necessary
May 24 2022,neutral,while i respect the origin story and themes of captain marvel as a character this is a film that makes the main hero way too overpowered that the third act is boring she is so powerful that the stakes and intrigue that the film builds dont matter because you know shes gonna kick everyones butt while its nice to have an inspiring hero and a less strict and cynical nick fury this is a flawed film that doesnt work
May 23 2022,positive,my favorite of all the marvel films
May 18 2022,negative,this movie would have been a train wreck without samuel l jackson
May 17 2022,negative,already a subpar movie as is but then you add brie larson to the mix and this becomes a whole other type of garbage
May 14 2022,positive,i had really wanted to like this movie and had high hopes from the trailers but it turned out to be one of my least favorite marvel movies  i know this is an origin story but in the end it does not seem like captain marvel is earths super hero as much as she is anybody but earths super hero  didnt really see the personal interaction between the characters that i would have expected  it reminds me of meeting your grandparents when you were 8 years old back in the 60s  70s before skype and video calls  your parents told you these old people were your grandparents and that you loved them so  you did  maybe you actually developed a relationship with them or maybe you just agreed that they were your grandparents and that you loved them  danvers seems to be the latter  and btw one of the things that annoys me about the whole veers thing is that dog tags are last name first first name last so her tags would have read danvers carol so if you only had half of a dog tag to name her by her name would be dan or arol not vers
May 14 2022,positive,overhated but not the best
May 14 2022,positive,i love this movie it is fun to see this empowered hero figure out her past it is a blast to see nick fury in his youth and get to know how he lost his eye love the story and the twist who the enemy actually is this movie has a lot of dry wit in it pacing is beautiful there are no dead spot but you do get time for characters to bond cant wait to see the sequel
May 12 2022,negative,this movie took the dreaded origin movie and made it even more bland by removing the character arc either due to brie larsens acting choices the director the writers or a combination of all of the above i couldnt tell you what really happens in this movie a couple years after having seen it its just such an alsoran its the nissan of superhero movies its just there taking up space that could have been filled by a better movie with a stronger message of hope andor diversity if thats what they were going for i hate bland so much awful movies are more watchable than this yawn
May 11 2022,positive,its not a bad movie but its definetly not one of the top marvel movies
May 10 2022,positive,second watch was by far better with more understanding still had a hard time connecting with brie larsons portrayal of carol danvers thankfully the supporting cast kept me interested
May 10 2022,negative,one star because if it was a bmovie id point the interesting plot around we are the bad guys but no  its designed as a blockbuster the worst as a somewhat real production it feels uncomfortable just to imagine that people actually worked on the scenario the dialogs and the actions so weird so many things are off the point that i give up already
May 9 2022,positive,mostly by the numbers marvel movie sam jackson elevated it beyond what it would have been  brie larson seems unusually reserved in the role her carol danvers lacks a little charisma  shes supposed to be the most powerful character in the mcu i guess  curious to see if she becomes more important in later team films
May 6 2022,neutral,one of the only marvel films i really struggled to watch
May 6 2022,negative,pure garbage   so many lines of dialogue are just cringe worthy  the completely emasculated the nick fury character to make captain marvel look good
May 4 2022,negative,oh wow dont you just love it when your main character can just do everything she has to from the first minute and doesnt have to evolve or learn a lesson throughout their journey cool stuff indeed
May 4 2022,negative,how was this certified fresh cringeworthingly terrible
May 3 2022,neutral,the main character is bland shes shown to be overpowered like superman but unlike superman she doesnt have charisma superman tends to move people because of his struggles of being a human this woman on the other hand is from the getgo an outsider she does not relate to human struggle and humans are essentially fodder to her i saw this move in the theatres and while the visual effects were great the story didnt seem appealing to me side characters were also all but forgettable except for the preestablished ones like nick fury    this is the kind of movie you watch when you have nothing better to do in life on a scale of 110 id give it a 4
May 3 2022,negative,they tried so hard to forcefeed the audience the girl power narrative that they forgot to develop any character traits for carol the longer i watched the less i cared
Apr 29 2022,negative,bland boring predictable
Apr 29 2022,negative,a movie that highly under delivered
Apr 29 2022,negative,very boring you cant grow to love characters in this movie because its too brief cgi ruins most movies wouldve rather seen more makeup  i found this movie to be corny
Apr 27 2022,positive,love the strong female role love that it was set back in time
Apr 26 2022,neutral,if not for sam jacksons performance this movie would lose an entire rating level for me brie larson seems wooden for a lot of the film and it is just another origin story that marvel has done a thousand times over and better    rating  fine
Apr 26 2022,negative,most boring plot out of the entire mcu
Apr 25 2022,positive,i like the movie the cat goose but it was kind of boring
Apr 22 2022,negative,a movie that could of been so much better with its potential bri larsen as the main character shows a emotionless super hero that doesnt fit her role one bit the writing was awful to someones abilities to take down multiple ships but cant take down thanos over all this movie is put in the books as one of the top worst marvel movies
Apr 19 2022,positive,unlike most origin storieslooking at you every first spiderman movie this film sores a hero most dont know well and has a great mixture of plot action and comedy
Apr 17 2022,negative,it is boring probably a script pull out at the last minute to try and cash in from the success of wonder woman not to mention it undermines the established characters of nick fury i wont be surprised if this was written by the same idiot that wrote solo
Apr 17 2022,negative,completely forgettable movie and definitely one of the worst mcu movies poorly written with probably one of the worst villains ive seen in recent times on the big screen
Apr 12 2022,positive,the hate is nonsense tbh the movie is so great i love the plot and sequence of this movie
Apr 10 2022,neutral,nothing particularly memorable about it other than the nick fury bits the premise had promise but the main character is quite forgettable
Apr 8 2022,negative,the movie was boring
Apr 6 2022,negative,feels less like a movie and more like an attack on sensibility could larson be any more cocky no depth or development to her character at all
Apr 5 2022,positive,one of the better marvel movies solid story from beginning to end
Apr 5 2022,positive,a real surprise scifi mixed with real world works well here liked how it was a prequel to everything that has gone before it
Apr 5 2022,positive,probably the most underrated movie of the mcu
Apr 4 2022,neutral,on paper this is a great film mcu in a retro setting kevin feige producing great supporting cast clark gregg alive and well youngified samuel l ben mendelsohn has great energy but the two main characters are not likable     in jude laws defense spoiler alert hes not really supposed to be but larson is definitely supposed to be likable and her performance is just flat and dull nothing like the charisma of gal gadot or scarlett johansson but everything thats wrapped around her is shiny and highbudget so marvel
Apr 3 2022,negative,it was horrible since the start its difficult to follow for someone that knows nothing about this character i wanted to like it but it was boring
Apr 2 2022,negative,the supporting cast was great the main character had less personality than cheap bubble gum has flavor
Apr 2 2022,positive,full of action funny moments captain marvel begins the story of what became the avengers and why they were started in the first place with excellent story development
Apr 1 2022,negative,one of the greatest stan lee cameos ever in a film but its trapped in a shit movie
Mar 31 2022,negative,if i somehow manage to hear brie larson be the most cocky woman on the face of the planet one more time without puking it would be a miracle
Mar 31 2022,negative,this movie has no personality
Mar 25 2022,negative,larson sucked didnt mesh with the cast and the acting was rough not in the spirit of the rest of the marvel body of work
Mar 23 2022,negative,ive seen bre act in other films and she did a really good job i dont know why it didnt show in this film i blame the director
Mar 22 2022,negative,easily the worst mcu movie in the lot as of march 2022 i found the superhero to just be downright unlikable
Mar 21 2022,positive,a good but flawed marvel flick captain marvel entertains the whole family it has great themes beautiful visuals and a hero you can look up to
Mar 21 2022,negative,if marvel executives and directors think this is an appealing movie to woman empowerment action they would be so wrong feels like an insult
Mar 19 2022,negative,ben mendelsohn is the best part of it despite some solid visuals the story itself was one of the weakest of the marvel films
Mar 18 2022,positive,a great superhero origin story this is not a new idea but one we dont see much anymore so it is fun to see brie lardons carol danvers grow and develop in front of our eyes lynch mendelsohn law and jackson are all great also and while brie larson hasnt yet settled into the role shes at a better starting position than most other heroes
Mar 15 2022,positive,i made an account just for this movie im also gonna leave reviews of other movies that i have seen    however i dont understand why people hated this movie its a great origin story it is a bit rocky but thats only because its a superhero movie samuel jackson is great as usual the chemistry between him and brie larson are nice i really did enjoy this no matter how bad reviews it gets
Mar 15 2022,positive,captain marvel is a good movie for the first female led movie in the mcu i think it did pretty well this movie was and i think still is being review bombed i personally think it lacked a bit of emotion not with the main character but from the villain but who knows perhaps well learn more about him in the second movie
Mar 12 2022,negative,this was one of the worst movies ive ever seen it was so bland dull and boring im not sure if brie larson wasnt meant to play this character or if she received no direction but carol was so lifeless and unlikeable in this movie none of the actors feel like they care at all when delivering lines i wanted to quit this movie so many times but stuck it out for the connection to endgame and it was so not worth it just skip it
Mar 9 2022,negative,i was initially intrigued and interested by the fact it was femaleled but this was an abomination to the mcu honestly this is the worst highbudget film i have ever watched
Mar 7 2022,positive,one of the weaker mcu films character seems shoved in at the last moment
Mar 7 2022,negative,very little villain development and was super cringe boring movie overall
Mar 7 2022,negative,forgettable fluff brie is a boring untalented actress that kinda makes this shit even worse
Mar 5 2022,negative,unwatchable i would seriously consider burning your tvtabletwatching device
Mar 4 2022,negative,its not bad movie its just meh and with non emotional relation  for the characters except nick fury i think black wieow its a little bit better thatn this movie
Mar 4 2022,positive,really liked it its not the best mcu movie but still a had fun watching it
Mar 1 2022,positive,good ideas flawed execution at the end of the film youll feel nothing and you wont have gone on a very deep emotional journey with carol not enough clear character development or themes the skrulls are fun though and so is past nick fury the other good guys and the kree antagonists fall flat however
Feb 24 2022,neutral,fair depiction of the 80s for sure but it lacks originality in the development my rating 510
Feb 22 2022,negative,the overpowered protagonist is boring and everything is forgettable
Feb 21 2022,negative,captain marvel should have been introduced way earlier as it builds her up to be very important in the upcoming movies
Feb 20 2022,negative,arguably the worst marvel movie ive ever seen and for perspective on that statement ive seen hulk no offense to eric bank one of the greatest actors in the world i could list its flaws but i have better things to do it has the overall quality of a made for tv movie not worth the full price ticket i bought to see it
Feb 20 2022,positive,not sure why the audience reviews are so bad most seem to have some other agenda rather than actually thinking the film was bad   as for me i began this movie with low expectations prepared for a very wokefeminist trashy plot with all the focus being on oh my god its a girl wow and not much relevance to the mcu i did not expect to be invested in the film at all   what i got was a plot that was actually almost an origin story for the mcu with a healthy amount of girl power that was pleasant and not rubbed in the face and quite a decent storyline with some cool action scenes and good humour its not the best film ive seen the plot was a bit predictable in places and the after a certain point the villains didnt seem dangerous enough for the plot to feel threatened by them but nonetheless i enjoyed seeing a less serious and twoeyed version of nick fury and overall this film far exceeded my expectations i enjoyed it more than i thought it would and certainly far more than reviewers who let some outside source affect their experience goose the catflerken is the best character imo   id recommend you watch it but please dont let some internet feud spoil it for you enjoy
Feb 18 2022,negative,the chemistry between brie and samuel l jackson feels forced plus brie larson is trying super hard not to act story should focus on heros journey but rather it tries to stir cultural poltics
Feb 18 2022,negative,i understand they want to create and elevate more strong female characters but with captain marvel its seem like that is the only thing they focused on this movie is riddled with glaring plot holes and mediocre lazy writing that often ignores negates andor renders nonsensical several elements previously established in the mcu the development of the main character seemed rushed and is so shallow one dimensional and forced that it almost seems as if the message they were trying to convey was more important to them than the story itself or creating a complex well rounded character that is intended i assume to be a cornerstone  in the next phase of the mcu
Feb 18 2022,negative,great movie about an allpowerful super hero whos only weaknesses are wooden dialogue and apathy
Feb 17 2022,positive,really enjoyed it  good story structure great girl power
Feb 16 2022,negative,this movie is so woke it forgot to do anything else but spew culture politics like you know build any sense of a character instead of telling us what they are have a consistent storyline with the rest of the mcu looking at you cthulhu cat and just so many more things the only good as with most marvel film is the sfxcgi the rest of this movie can together with brie as a human just be forgotten to history as a mistake
Feb 9 2022,negative,seems like the movie was pushed out quickly for captain marvel to be pushed into endgame that being said the movie doesnt take advantage of a potentially good origin story and the villains
Feb 7 2022,positive,brie larson and nicholas are just perfect together this movie is also great
Feb 7 2022,positive,not the best in the marvel franchise but it ties in a lot of the movies there are some really clever moments but they spend too much time preaching about the power of women while forgetting the movie is about a woman who is the most powerful in the galaxy
Feb 4 2022,neutral,a classic case of inheritance without sacrifice as if being born with silver spoon in the mouth makes others empathize with them way over powered no pain only gainwheres the fun in that
Feb 4 2022,negative,the actress is horrible an amateur grandma pretends to like me and is a better actress than her doesnt even compare to warda  scarlet witch
Feb 3 2022,negative,nothing new startling or punchy so bythenumbers the plot reminded me of those bad 1980s superhero movies but with a bigger budget the reveal was telegraphed so anyone surprised by the twist wasnt paying attention i guess     there was also a smugness by the main character i found to be sort of strange for a character that supposedly was trying to solve a mystery like she already knew the ending of her own story and belittled anyone not keeping up
Feb 1 2022,positive,its a real booster a film to watch on a school day i might add its very fresh and cool its not for everyones taste but it sure is a blaster so watch if u want scifi and wanna be cool 
Feb 1 2022,negative,another boring film brie larson was nice like a toaster
Jan 30 2022,negative,i wish they could have done better with the character wasted so much potential
Jan 27 2022,positive,my rating for the film is a 6410
Jan 19 2022,positive,good movie the end is not good its have to match cgi
Jan 18 2022,positive,espectacular movie giving us a different perspective of a origin story since its a female superhero i know the girl empowerment this movies gives is strong and doesnt feel forced and as a man with no fragile masculinity i can say i loved that
Jan 17 2022,negative,the movie was mediocre at best i only watched to connect some dots from other movies from the universe the worst marvel movie in my opinion
Jan 17 2022,positive,captain marvel is a decent superhero action movie great costumes and special effects fight scenes and chase scenes are excellent the story is formulaic but there is a plot twist that makes it more interesting i love how the kree and the skrulls were designed and represented i just dont agree with one of the casting choices humor is alright but some lines and situations were too cheesy the cat named goose stole the show by being both adorable and badass carol danvers origin was well told and presented it was great to see young monica rambeau i hope we get to see more of her in the future my expectation for this movie was rather high and i was hoping for more depth and substance but i was still entertained nonetheless its still a good addition to the evergrowing superhero roster of the mcu not to mention a good precursor to the muchawaited avengers end game movie
Jan 16 2022,positive,larson is a great choice for the role she brings welcome levity and verve to the movie this is great as theres little else here thats worth recommending
Jan 16 2022,neutral,the first marvel female hero solo adventure sadly fell way too short as wit antman and the wasp this movie exists for the sole purpose of introducing a new hero in the next marvel big thing avengers endgame one would think that the adventures of a half alien half human superhero on earth while trying to save a whole species from another planet from extinction would be fun to watch add to this that it happens during the 90s and you have a great movie in front of you but regardless of that they found a way to mess it up    the writing on itself doesnt feel bad but the way the story is told is just awful besides we dont get nothing new in here just a generic story of good triumphing against evil with a very generic and underdevelop villain honestly this feels like marvel studios was just trying to take our money while we wait for avengers endgame it feels like they were not even trying shame on you marvel studios
Jan 16 2022,positive,it was an okay movie captain marvel as a character i thought was kind of shallow and i felt like the movie was a bit of a copy of thor
Jan 15 2022,positive,i thought this was a great introduction to captain marvel 
Jan 15 2022,negative,worst mcu movie wasted so much potential for jokes that werent funny nicks eye the action is horrible so predictable half of the movie doesent make sense worst mcu film would rather watch dark world for a day straight
Jan 15 2022,negative,bad choice in casting brie larson as the strongest superhero in the mcu brie larsons awkward presence as captain marvel made this movie hard to watch the plot wasnt bad but was limited by sloppy writing and awkward performance 410
Jan 13 2022,positive,too many people are being dishonest about this movie because they have an agenda this is an honest review for those of you who are considering watching it  its a pretty good marvel film overall if you enjoy the ongoing story continuing through the mcu this one is worth watching as a film id put it in the area of dr strange and antman its much better than thor the dark world and not as good as captain america the winter soldier a fair rating for audience score would be more around 86
Jan 12 2022,negative,pretty flat plot brie larson fails to make the character more than 1 dimensional badass
Jan 11 2022,negative,boring action sequences almost none but in the few action sequences there are danvers is invulnerable and the villains are just bad so there are no stakes bad jokes horrible portrayal from bree larson a missed opportunity on a great hero and not even de soundtrack is good in captain marvel memorable in every movie from the mcu    besides we wanted much more from nick fury and phil coulson finally what they did with marvell they disrespected every marvel comic fan in the planet
Jan 10 2022,positive,decent but nothing special samuel l jackson saved the movie
Jan 9 2022,negative,just awful but then again that wont surprise man hating brie this film wasnt made for me  apparently
Jan 9 2022,positive,absolutely amazing people hate on brie but shes awesome the movie was one of the best marvel movies and is underrated love the storyline and her powers are so cool i think people dislike her bc shes more powerful than thor so thats a shame
Jan 9 2022,negative,the story was boring and poorly thought out brie larson fell flat and really makes captain marvel be an rude condescending arrogant and unlikable character kinda had me rooting for thanos a little in endgame definitely worth skipping
Jan 8 2022,negative,had potential but the movie is let down by poor casting  brie larson is flat and wooden while no amount of cgi can help samuel jackson be convincing as a younger version of himself  captain marvels personal inner struggle told by flashbacks to her struggle growing up is well done and probably the high point of the movie  and while the movie also includes some twists in the story it movie never really comes together in an interesting way
Jan 8 2022,positive,i think this movie got its hate because it released at the time where all anyone cared about was endgame the movie is far from flawless with a bit heaviness on the 90s references some lines in this film make scenes in iron man 2 with phil seem out of place example of this is the sheild acronym being a thing in the 90s but iron man 2 phil couldnt think of it at all until the end the origin story is told in a fine way and empowers a female lead in a wonderful way but leaves some things unexplained like how the tech works
Jan 6 2022,neutral,it took me along time to actually like captian marvel and the bad guy plot wasnt that good
Jan 4 2022,negative,what i love about marvel movies is that they seem to wow me whether its with a specific character or just with humor mixed with with some great action this delivered on none of this and while it was fine for some i guess i had to stop myself from walking out multiple times
Jan 4 2022,positive,review bombers for the last jedi and this are proof as to why the audience rating is bullshit
Jan 2 2022,positive,it was a good film just couldve been so much better
Jan 2 2022,negative,probably the worst marvel movie but had potential they change the character to much to fit the actress and that was the wrong move since she is the complete opposite from captain marvel she has the look for the character but other than that she may not be the right fit in the long run for captain marvel
Jan 1 2022,positive,underrated gem of the mcu genre captain marvel is one of the few times girl power doesnt feel so forced predictably the attempts to shoehorn american militarism into a story that never needed it alongside girl power hold it back
Jan 1 2022,negative,i missed out on it when it released fully watched it yesterday terrible story with main character acting worse than a scarecrow giving it half a point because samuel l jackson made the screen a lot more pleasant  tolerable
Dec 31 2021,neutral,sadlynick fury caried the movie so much that now i think he has back problems i loved all of his scenes  especially the ending scene which is very important to the whole mcu plotline thing cpt marvels powers are kinda interesting but also kind of too simple the storyline was alright
Dec 29 2021,positive,an enjoyable empowering story
Dec 28 2021,negative,this movie felt like the longest movie ive ever watched so much potential in this story yet its terrible an hour in i thought the movie had to be almost over turns out i was only an hour in halfway through almost unable to finish it
Dec 28 2021,neutral,such potential and allot of disappointment throughout the entire movie sadly its definitely a girls movie as my aunty and daughter loves the movie but it just had allot of problems while the visuals look good but the dialogue and story writing character development or lack of its just hard to watch and find myself pulling out the phone and checking out movie new over this its that bad i usually give movies a chance but its not redeemable opens the potential of knocking it out the park on the upcoming sequel so theirs that
Dec 28 2021,negative,this was terrible one of the worst superhero movies ever thats pretty bad
Dec 25 2021,negative,boring predictable and not essential movie brie is not very good at acting also
Dec 25 2021,positive,the movie wasnt that good the character was acting like it is not real
Dec 25 2021,positive,an origin story that the truth is very well developed the problem is the characters which i think they made them very funny and with little seriousness and i mean all the characters protagonists secondary and antagonists  i think the visuals look very good but i wouldnt say theyre surprising and the music to be honest leaves a lot to be desired  in conclusion i would say that without problems it is a tape that can be eliminated from the equation that is marvel without any problem since more than anything it only serves as context so that we know the character before seeing avengers endgame so to finish i would say that it is a blockbuster that serves to have a good time but other than that i think there is no room for more
Dec 23 2021,neutral,a soso superhero film that doesnt do anything special to make you want to watch it a second time character development is nonexistent and action scenes are ok at best most of the humor is mediocre and sometimes a few badly placed jokes ruin scenes
Dec 23 2021,negative,captain marvel as a character is hard to root for
Dec 22 2021,positive,i went into this movie thinking it would reign supreme primarily for being a female leading marvel movie the first for the mcu the movie was a bit dry and drab but nevertheless a powerful super hero was born
Dec 19 2021,positive,people who complain about this movie live in the basement and think ayn rand is highly intelligent
Dec 19 2021,negative,oh boy where to start how to not write a strong female character maybe this was nothing but embracing a mary sue with cringeworthy tropes against men seriously thank god marvel made black widowwhich is definitely better so we could laugh at this even more     also the main actress i believed her acting in no second of the movie whatsoever
Dec 19 2021,positive,an awesome hilarious well overdue movie
Dec 18 2021,negative,wayy too much outer space and confusion yeah i suppose learning about the creatures this early on helped me understand easier down the line while watching the other films though 223
Dec 16 2021,positive,captain marvel has a lot of problems and while not a bad movie it is just an ok movie as a result the movie has an ok plot but it suffers most from the pacing issues and with an uninteresting lead character at the front of every scene there are a lot of dead points in the film where it feels like nothing is happening the film could probably be trimmed down to an hour and twenty minutes and nothing would be lost luckily for the film though all the other characters around carol keep this movie afloat and are the best parts of this movie especially the main villain talos if doing a rewatch of the marvel cinematic universe i have to label this movie as a pass and especially if doing a bare minimum view of the marvel cinematic universe stay away from this movie
Dec 16 2021,negative,very boring and flat main character is unlikeable
Dec 14 2021,positive,samuel l jackson as nick fury makes this one worth watching but captain marvel is a bland hero with vaguely defined powers and a boring backstory its fun at times but doesnt have the same heart that other mcu movies have
Dec 13 2021,positive,i really liked this film and thought it was a great story with some really great acting and awesome action scenes i dont understand why people are hating so badly on this film and i think brie larson and the supporting cast are all doing a superb job along with the crew doing some really stellar work as well while the film might not be on par with the best standalone mcu films which include captain america the winter soldier black panther iron man thor ragnarok and shang chi it is definitely not as bad as either thor the dark world iron man 2 or iron man 3 i chose to give it a higher score than it deserves because i honestly do not believe this film which has one of the most brilliant actresses out there in the main role especially if you have seen room deserves the amount of hate it gets
Dec 12 2021,negative,mediocre acting weak plot thin character or just bad acting watching larson in other marvel movies im going with bad acting shes sterile and emotionless
Dec 10 2021,negative,i give it 1 star instead of 12 star because the cgi is sometimes okay otherwise there is little to enjoy especially brie larsons acting which is outrageously bad
Dec 9 2021,negative,the biggest issue i have with this movie is the lack of a heroes journey here we have an ultra overpowered superhero who feels more like an entitled brat who can do whatever they please the personality doesnt change throughout the movie nor does it change in any other appearance she has made it is a terrible bland movie starring an uninterested actress who when watching feels like she would rather be anywhere else
Dec 8 2021,positive,ill never understand the hate around this movie its ultimately a good movie and defintely better than half of mcu
Dec 5 2021,positive,captain marvel added to the mcu by expanding on the past and how it affects the present  and although the movie is a bit lackluster in terms of creating emotional bonds to characters the fight scenes are on point
Dec 2 2021,positive,yeeesss all time favorite love brie larson love the unexcused feminism love the story
Nov 28 2021,negative,i was lost from the beginning halfway thru i kind of figured out what was going on but by then i lost hope of understanding the overall plot and only focused on the action scene by scene it took the end of the movie to completely spell it out for me to understand what i just watched
Nov 28 2021,negative,waste of time and a waste of actors that could be used in a better engaging feminist film
Nov 23 2021,positive,first the good stuff 1 samuel l jackson he played a more softened nick fury but very much agent coulson prior avengers like with a lot of attitude sarcastic humor and less serious also the deaging is becoming so good that you wouldnt even be able to notice it even if you really looked his character was very well done on script and screen    2 some of the action the space battle stuff etc was very well done the special effects team did an amazing job at this movie nothing felt or looked fake kudos    3 surprise surprise the story from the trailers you would not be able to predict this but the story is actually really interesting the way they introduce her past was very originally done the way she remembers things through different ways was clever very clever even because it doesnt make her past like an obstacle you first gotta go through it added to the story while adding to her character also multiple twist and 1 big one that even got me thinking for a while    4 ben mendelson really impressive job very layered surpringsly and stand out in my books the acting is general was very good    the bad    1 it misses spectacle and a standout moment in thor 3 for example you had the intro scene and the end scene which were big standout moments and a manifestation of thors powers i feel you didnt get that in this movie    2 like i said the story was great the execution aka the screenplayscript lacked they had such great storypoints but they were all done so quickly and those moments lacked emotion the friendship between carol and her friend didnt feel real she seemed to have a more genuine relationship with her kid rather than with her and that bothered me a bit since they seemed all buddy buddy in the past and even during some moments in the film where i was like but you didnt deserve that yet bens character had a more emotional impact on me than carol yikes and i dont mean that in a killmongertchalla kind of way    3 some of the action again some action just wasnt good there is a moment she is fighting the skrullthe moment she yells at the skrull in the trailer and that whole fighting sequence was horribly filmed and choreographed which is weird because she another scene where she is fighting the skrull in the film and then the action seemed way better filmed    all in all the film was good nothing more and nothing less i missed an emotional attachment to the main character i felt like i still didnt know her after the film and i think thats because they tried to give her a certain personality that just didnt fit the film she was supposed to be a bit arrogant but i wouldve loved to see more vulnerablity in a woman that is the strongest creature in the world and they made me believe that btw she come across as amazingly powerfull at one point in the film believe me wonderwomans vulnerability and her femine side me fall in love with the character and they stripped that away fromm carol and basically made her less relatable     is definitely a good time in the theatre and some of the scenes are quite the spectacle and i loved the shock and awe that some scenes provided especially the way she got her powers go see it
Nov 23 2021,negative,belowpar for the mcu powerful women in cinema have rocked for decades and dont need to be so obvious
Nov 21 2021,negative,this is one of the worst marvel movies you can clearly see that this wasnt made by someone who wanted to tell an amazing story but by someone who wantend to make money and push there politic agenda into the marvel universe the story is okay and the setup is good but the execution is unbelivalby bad the cat had the most chacater developpment and the worst thing is how silly they wanted to make nick fury it just doesnt sits right with me how he his character just always followed the main character and was basicly just there so people could have a familiar face all in all its a shit movie dont watch it
Nov 21 2021,positive,theres just not enough female heroes like this great story love the twist and the assumptions we make being challenged
Nov 19 2021,positive,as a huge fan of captain marvel from her ms marvel days i loved this mcu adaptation brie larson did a great job getting her personality down cant wait to see more of her in the mcu
Nov 18 2021,negative,ive never seen someone with less charisma on screen than brie larson whose acting was so hollow in this film the character is never developed into someone you even care about and the story just isnt very interesting  i love samuel jackson and even he couldnt save this film this is the worse marvel movie i have seen so far
Nov 18 2021,positive,such a good flick she is so strong cant wait to watch this character grow
Nov 17 2021,negative,heres the odd thing the story is actually pretty interesting what killed this movie was brie larson she just comes across as unlikeable and an unlikeable hero is no bueno in a superhero movie if a different actress was cast as captain marvel this film would feel really differenta much more positive vibe weve seen protagonists with memory issues about their past in other movies like jason bourne so its not like heroes with amnesia have to be portrayed the way larson does it but she does it in a way thats just no fun so we dont root for carol danvers like we did for jason bourne
Nov 16 2021,positive,i rewatched the movie yesterday and it was really entertaining a good marvel movie at its best
Nov 15 2021,negative,this film was shit had to stop watching then pick up again just to finish it larson comes off as flat throughout the whole film except when shes acting the part of a cocky mary sue which i doubt was awfully hard as it reflects her real life persona method acting on another level
Nov 15 2021,negative,the film is nothing special and lacks much of the charm that other mcu films carry with them samuel l jackson carries this movie though brie larson also does fine and the banter between the two is often enjoyable to watch the action sequences are done very poorly and the cgi at parts does not hold up the film also felt very preachy at parts and it constantly tries to force a message down youre throat the direction that the movie goes in however is good and i think that it ties in wonderfully in the mcu overall the film is very generic just with an added dose of preachiness that i felt was unnecessarily added
Nov 15 2021,negative,brie larsons first outing as a marvel character to say that this feature had potential is an understatement nothing but bland and boring from start to finish and i only went to see it because its supposed to have been tied into one of the most successful films of all time
Nov 14 2021,positive,i am here because i think getting a bad rating for saying critics who do not understand a story should not be reviewing it is not a good excuse to badly rate a good movie it is a load of bs love the movie woman power and very nostalgic
Nov 14 2021,negative,brie larson looks so bored in the movie her character looks as if someone bankrupted her family and now shes seeking revenge i do think she is a great actress especially enjoying her character in scott pilgrim but this movie made as her dull as a potato unfortunately highly recommended if you have insomnia
Nov 14 2021,negative,if youve watched all the others you may enjoy it or at least want to watch it for completion of the mcu otherwise this is one of the more skippable movies in the franchise
Nov 13 2021,negative,really dull  irritating tries too hard to be empowering  ends up annoying
Nov 13 2021,positive,love captain marvel cant wait for the sequel
Nov 12 2021,negative,i wanted to like it but they trade storytelling plot humor character development quality and entertainment for a strong female role model with no flaws or growth in herself or her powers if you want to know the fastest way to make an unlikeable character and a boring preachy movie this movie is a masterclass i wish it was done better i wanted the marvel version of wonder woman just as much as the next guy but it wasnt to be
Nov 12 2021,negative,this movie is just another example of how stale our modern movie world has gotten it is preachy not fun it is annoying not progressive when half of the marvel fans are men it is a bad idea to make men seem like stupid weak and lame pushovers in your films because i being man do not generally like it i do not like mary sues who stand above men like some sort of super human this movie is flash but has nothing more going for it it just feels like captain marvel is about a strong woman fighting against a world that is against that but the thing is most men support women we just do not like it when women try to portray us as being the worst things in the universe
Nov 12 2021,negative,absoultly horrible sooooo boring it took me 3 attmepts to watch the movie without sleeping captain marvel is so boring the action is bad and your telling me nick fury lost his eye from a fricking cat nick fury is the only good thing about this movie     dont watch this worst marvel movie by far
Nov 9 2021,negative,one word dull very dull
Nov 8 2021,positive,loved how it showed someone proving themselves not to others       good visuals always thought they needed new directors though shouldnt be codirectors for a movie on that gravity too many conflicting ideas and voices on what should be put in and how to portray her im sure the marvels will have more action and showing her weaknesses
Nov 8 2021,positive,thought this movie was amazing one of my favourite marvel movies
Nov 8 2021,negative,awful need a clear story rather than one that leans on the supporting cast too much
Nov 8 2021,positive,love the soundtrack and love the 90s vibes brie is a total badass bae queen
Nov 8 2021,positive,badass i love the fact that there is zero cliche love story captain marvel is on a mission and she aint got time for generic love plots love it
Nov 8 2021,positive,she so badass i love her
Nov 8 2021,positive,want really a fan unfortunately
Nov 7 2021,positive,it is a bit of a clunky film at times with odd pacing at some points the stuff with anette bening and all the flashbacks made the film hard to follow at some points however the film is still a joy to watch and the dynamic between samuel l jackson and brie larson is quite enjoyable
Nov 6 2021,positive,secondary film good cast acting otherwise everything is not so rosy in my opinion the most memorable movie in the history of marvel how much time has passed and it has not remained in my head
Nov 6 2021,negative,its marvel jim but not as well know it    a bit meh but ok if youve got it in in the background  carol doesnt work like wonder  woman for example and just falls a bit flat
Nov 6 2021,negative,i honestly thought this movie was truly bad brie larsens acting was flat and the story was rushed i was not a fan of the new disney woke way of creating movies putting politics ahead of good story telling i will watch the second one when it is released but will have much lower expectations 
Nov 6 2021,negative,worse marvel film made it date even samuel l jackson couldnt save it
Nov 6 2021,negative,between the dull plotline stiff wooden acting by brie lawson gender swapping marvell i havent been this disappointed in a marvel film sinceneverthen came the eternalsyikes
Nov 6 2021,negative,weakest marvel movie so far inconsistent boring story main character pretty unlikeable and as interesting as a plank of wood
Nov 6 2021,positive,how can people not like this movie its blooming fantastic the cast the action was just pure gold and the humour of it was amazing i loved the movie the action sequences though was love
Nov 6 2021,negative,i really wanted to like this film  in discussions of the trailers i was making excuses for larsons character being such a plank as it seemed to fit the character of a test pilot but then we saw it and boy howdy  you really cant have two hours of the main character being utterly expressionless and responding inappropriately to other characters unless the subject is autism which i presume this was not  i dont know if this was larsons interpretation of the character or some really inept direction but her character was totally unlikable and unrelatable to a degree ive never seen in a marvel movie  even thanos the monster bad guy had moments where you could relate to him  captain marvel was an action figure stuck in a live action film  just there
Nov 5 2021,positive,good fun movie with a slightly weak villain however this movie is definitely overhated
Nov 5 2021,positive,definitely as good as any other marvel movie even the critics agree brie larson was awesome as captain marvel with this audience rating basically what you have is a bunch of whiny bros perhaps from saturns moon inceladus who think brie is mean so they felt the need to bomb the ratings cant wait to see her again in the marvels 2023
Nov 5 2021,positive,awesome film fun fantasy adventure
Nov 4 2021,positive,surprise me with her power
Nov 2 2021,positive,the first 20 minutes are a little clunky but this was seriously fun loved the 90s soundtrack and my god brie larson is great people are missing the point that her un emotional acting is story based and not on her skills shes an oscar winner yall cant wait to see more of carol danvers in the future
Nov 1 2021,positive,not nearly as bad as everyone pretends it is
Nov 1 2021,neutral,you know something is off when you finished watching the movie and can barely remember the story already and all i can say about captain marvel is that shes strong but nothing about her as a person or a character  because thats what marvel gave us  nothing  she doesnt have a strong connection with anyone  she is simply there       i wouldnt say there wasnt any betrayal etc  but you simply dont see anything beyond carol beating them up   i mean you dont feel she felt anything  i mean say contrast it to another marvel scene  loki yelling at odin tell me tony telling cap i thought i was your friend it doesnt require more screen time but the audience felt that  maybe the its the director maybe its the lead actor but the movie despite its great effects and fight scene was just dry and unmemorable      its still entertaining something to watch when its there  but when all most folks  na remember from a movie is how a supporting character lost an eye and nothing about the the lead of whose origin story is being told  its not much of an origin story
Oct 31 2021,negative,the movie was just overrated no story no thrill  only kids will have enjoyed this
Oct 29 2021,negative,thinly written but well acted brie larson and samuel jackson are fun together in spite of a predictable and underdeveloped origin story
Oct 28 2021,negative,this movie was poorly written poorly acted drivel that was shoved down the throats of audiences they literally released it at a time when people were more interested in infinity war easter eggs and the movies post credit scenes one awesome bit is where they reinvent where the avengers team name is from to give more significance to the character but doing nothing to further the plot throughout the film there is never a thing that actually challenges her and the villain is jude law and a computer really 
Oct 27 2021,negative,it was visually really impressive they made a man hating plank of wood a superhero
Oct 25 2021,negative,no sensible plot the cgi was subpar the protagonist has no visible weakness and is more a mary sue marvels clearly run out of ideas
Oct 23 2021,negative,a movie and character that could have been left out of the mcu and no one would have noticed it didnt advance the storyline and had overt intersectional ideology beating you over the head that actually had the main character acting in horrible ways because of feminist empowerment it had potential but it turned out bad
Oct 23 2021,negative,i saw it but i dont remember it at all worst marvel movie ever
Oct 23 2021,negative,mcu makes good movies but honestly what is this i cant relate or feel for this character at all the storytelling is slightly sloppy and why did they sacrifice a huge part of nick furys identity for a lame joke shes too emotional when was she ever emotional shes funny and smart name one scene where shes funny and smart
Oct 17 2021,negative,not faithful to the comics and was boring but samuel jackson was great in it
Oct 17 2021,negative,the worst mcu film that i consider to be nearly unwatchable it has some redeeming things about it like samuel jacksons performance but overall really hard to watch 210
Oct 12 2021,negative,it didnt respect much the original comic books plus lame acting and weak history and development
Oct 11 2021,negative,awful why do i make myself watch these
Oct 10 2021,negative,brie larson is a fing goddess in this movie a perfect godlikestrong hero goddess anyway yeah i yawned through most of this flick
Oct 9 2021,negative,a hot mess from start to finish  i couldnt comprehend the so called plot so i tried to watch again  five minutes in i had to shut it off to avoid nausea
Oct 9 2021,negative,one of the worst movies i ever seen so boring  no plot at all brie larson acting cool like a emotionaless robot makes the character even more dislikable than it already is villians  cgi are also very bad
Oct 7 2021,negative,between no flaws no personalities no emotional responses to anything and vague powers that are so strong nothing can even challenge the hero this movie is a snoozefest it also creates and then doesnt answer a few questions about the larger mcu universe but does answer poorly questions we never asked like how nick fury lost his eye or where the name for the avengers initiative came from i can not stress enough that they answer these questions really poorly while bad writing creates new questions they just are never going to answer
Oct 7 2021,negative,totally full of fails plotholes and brie larson is son hateful and nothing memorable
Oct 6 2021,positive,the film is okay the big issues like slow pace weak characterization and some bad action scenes but i think its better than people give it credit for with good cgi great performances and some good humor
Oct 4 2021,negative,marvels writing flat one dimensional characters who never need to overcome anything has ruined the mcu the trend started with this movie and with the notable exception of endgame has completely turned me from a fan to a former fan of marvel
Oct 3 2021,negative,its the worst movie its a shame for a superhero movies cant believe what people are nowadays that it made more than a billion dollars
Oct 3 2021,negative,it had some reasonable bones but just tired of the messages over entertainment
Oct 2 2021,negative,the problem with this movie is that it is not entertaining the storyline looks good on paper but the director whoever that is seems so terrified of anyone being bored even for a second that there is no time for character development the main character lacks screen presence it is almost cruel it looks a bit like when the cast of friends tried to be movie actors strange brie larson looks the part but she does not act it hard to see why they cast her for this role
Oct 1 2021,positive,while this film deserves 35 stars im going to give it a 5 to balance out all the trolls who review bombed this film  its a worthy addition to the mcu and introduces a fantastic character who i hope to see for years to come
Oct 1 2021,negative,finally seen the movie and i have not much to say
Sep 27 2021,negative,miss marvel is just a one note character there is no joy in playing the character nothing brie does makes me like the character i kept reading comparison to robert downey jr but she bring nothing to the role rdj brought ironman to life
Sep 26 2021,positive,this movie was phenomenal ive never seen marvel fail a movie this movie had great acting great effects and had a great story and once the movie starts your already hooked thats what i love about this movie its interesting right off the bat and its also not a confusing movie i would definitely recommend watching this because you will not be disappointed
Sep 26 2021,positive,my favorite mcu movie brie larson is outstanding as carol danvers  aka captain marvel the most powerful avenger in the mcu
Sep 25 2021,negative,what a missed opportunity
Sep 24 2021,positive,while far from the best that the mcu has to offer its a satisfying adventure with some laughs and interesting new additions to the universe brie larson does a good job considering the character
Sep 21 2021,neutral,not worth a theater ticket sacrifices genuine alienness for snappy dialogue and contemporary comebacks  good cast good production values  lame writing  was a lot like female heroes in male drag or a 60s bewitched for the 2000s  just wish to make it so
Sep 19 2021,positive,i enjoy watching films in the marvel cinematic universe  this one was okay  i found myself disoriented and a little overwhelmed with the unfamiliarity of the alien setup up and the apparent contradictions of certain things with other mcu stories  those things were sorted out over the course of the film but i found the disorientation unpleasant  while i appreciate that audio description was provided particularly valuable in action films i was disappointed that they encoded on a dolby 20 track rather than a 51 track  ive come to appreciate the surround sound and feel cheated when it is not there
Sep 16 2021,positive,the first female lead film in the mcu is a decent effort brie larson wonderfully plays the emotionally withdrawn and sarcastic carol danvers there are some slight pacing issues and the original score isnt the best but overall its a sound film i was really offended by the onslaught of fan hate for this film as every criticism had to do with the feminist tone the dry and sarcastic lead hello iron man and the overuse of cgi hello every superhero movie made my one hope is that if a sequel is made i want to see monica rambeau the 2nd captain marvel in the comics also gain her powers and become danvers protege
Sep 11 2021,positive,best movie of all time enjoyed it from beginning to end dont let the salty haters fool you they just mad they got their feelings hurt this movie is instant classic 
Sep 11 2021,negative,i just hate how perfect captain marvel is and how big of an ass hole she is
Sep 10 2021,positive,look it may be a little flat and a phase 1 movie later seems kind of repetitive but its still good fun
Sep 8 2021,positive,the movie was fine until spoiler warning captain marvel unlocked her full powers  just steamroll through all of the enemies without breaking a sweat this ruins what should have been the climax of the movie because the bad guys are literally no threat to her at all but everything prior to that point is fine
Sep 5 2021,positive,this movie gets way too much hate for no reason ríe larson killed it as captain marvel and she was phenomenal i give this film a 7 out of 10
Sep 4 2021,neutral,a very formulatic movie with a weak plot and bad villians creating an unsatisfactory movie  i like the character of captian marvel although this plot did not do justice to her and left her very undeveloped  the plot was very weak following the mcu formula yet again but to less positive results  the villians were just plain bad no real goals or intentions  nick fury was more of a laughing stock in this movie which is not very fitting to his character making him unlikeable  the visuals were good but everything else was bad leaving a headache of a movie i wish they could of done better but sadly this is just a bad movie
Sep 4 2021,negative,while marvel usually has a main character that has some development such as tony stark none exist for captain marvel played by an actress with the emotional range of a block of wood you wont find any enjoyment here other than the fact its part of the mcu
Sep 2 2021,positive,i just didnt enjoy the movie the main character was just not fun to watch 610
Sep 2 2021,positive,captain marvel is really worth a watch very entertaining and visually impressive
Aug 31 2021,negative,half of it is the cookie cutter mass produced marvel movie  the other half is boring the villain is weak like no abilities what so ever to make him qualify as a villain  i would best describe it as the people involve spent most of the time going through a political checklist and then fed it into the marvel money machine
Aug 30 2021,positive,the film is fine in general except for the pacing that is sometimes off however captain marvels strength does not make you watch in awe but instead makes most threats meaningless and the film having no impact on the audience at all
Aug 26 2021,negative,even though this is one of the weaker films in the mcu in my opinion some of it is highly enjoyable
Aug 25 2021,negative,not the worst of the recent mcu movies which is the only reason id give it more than 1 star
Aug 25 2021,positive,1525  best moment friendship with nick the alien people
Aug 23 2021,positive,its not perfect but its pretty enjoyable brie larsons pretty entertaining but i feel like she was holding herself back her chemistry with samuel l jackson and the girls playing the rambeaus is pretty good but i think she struggles to play off jude law
Aug 22 2021,positive,this film is so cool and so relevant and theyre hinting at a lesbian avenger and i seriously hope it goes that way i love how carol is strong and powerful probably the strongest avenger in the mcu and shes still not perfect there are many scenes in this film that are so important i wish i had grown up with these messages as a girl we also got a longoverdue introduction to the kree and a lot of easter eggs regarding fury were explained but its a little hard to swallow that carol hadnt been summoned in previous avengerlevel situations before its a very good film oh and the soundtrack is a masterpiece
Aug 15 2021,positive,the movie is 4 stars for me but i vote 45 cuz is so underrated
Aug 14 2021,positive,i love this movie it made me carol be my favorite heroine
Aug 12 2021,negative,not worth your time ideology driven versus strong story telling very bland acting sam jackson was good but the lead actress was bland no acting skills at all
Aug 12 2021,negative,wooden acting shoddy plot overpowered hero the half star is purely for samuel l jackson motherf
Aug 11 2021,negative,it more or less tried to cram 40 years of character development into a tiny movie and it left a jarring and disorienting film realistically this should have been a trilogy not a rush job with time it could have been a thing of beauty now it was a hollow shell of her comic book origins
Aug 10 2021,negative,what is this what happened to the film industry in the last couple of years   only positive thing this movie would have inspired little girls all over the world to become mediocre actresses playing badass mary sues kicking ass and taking names when they grow up unfortunately they didnt watch it
Aug 3 2021,positive,i thought that this film was quite good a really interesting and engaging story captain marvel is a great character and a welcome addition to the franchise it had great visuals and action
Aug 2 2021,negative,overestimated character bad acting distortions made to please ideology
Aug 1 2021,negative,im mostly mad that this film ruined nick furys character in winter soldier he says he was double crossed this movie made a joke out of it and ill never forgive them 
Aug 1 2021,negative,while i will always take more phil coulson and nick fury the first femaleled solo film in the mcu was a lot of flash but little substance
Jul 30 2021,negative,nothing at all like the comics why bother taking these characters and completely changing them
Jul 29 2021,negative,extremely subpar often awkward forced and embarrassing to watch there is absolutely no chemistry between brie larson and samuel l jackson its just painful at times to watch one of the absolute bottom tier marvel movies
Jul 28 2021,negative,the movie was boring the lead was unlikable
Jul 27 2021,negative,bad writing worse acting from the lead samuel l jackson being reduced to an ethnic sidekick was painful to watch it held zero revelations about infinity war and piggybacked upon the success of a much better pair of movies purely because of a deceptive marketing campaign
Jul 27 2021,negative,unrelatable and unlikeable   the back story on nick fury broke the character
Jul 26 2021,positive,disappointing yet satisfying this film pushes you through a fun story that has smart ideas and great connections but very predictable plotlines and boring sequences that rappel you from the story overall the mystery visuals and action keep you hooked to a decent marvel film with great connections to the mcu
Jul 26 2021,negative,they seem to have entirely forgoten how to write human real struggles into characters and stories so they now default to the demode script of conceited women as heroine to make it worst is boring and the lead character has some bad idea of what acting and performance should be
Jul 26 2021,neutral,a very mixed bag with a bunch of missed opportunities but its far from bad
Jul 26 2021,negative,not a very good movie carol danvers has never been a popular or well liked character so the problems with this movie begin with its actual conception add in a backwards story some flat acting and useless girl power sequences and the movie shoots itself in the foot the bright point of this movie is the character of nick fury who is much more charismatic in his younger years
Jul 25 2021,neutral,preachy i dont watch a superhero movie to be preached about something actions scenes were good but the protagonist was full of spite and honestly quite bad    show dont tell is a good rule to follow and in depicting this heroine as the be all end all they failed big without the preachiness it could have been a better movie
Jul 25 2021,positive,this was a fun movie not the best mcu movie but certainly not the worst
Jul 25 2021,negative,terrible writing and to call the acting wooden is an insult to trees
Jul 25 2021,positive,not marvels best but overall a great film the audience score with more than twice the amount of reviews than any other of the 23 mcu films to date is the result of a boycott against brie larson
Jul 24 2021,negative,behold the future of filmmaking everything will always be terrible forevermore
Jul 24 2021,negative,maybe i was coming in too hyped for this movie but it was the first marvel movie let down it wasnt the last
Jul 23 2021,negative,horrible writing and acting if youre making an action movie get a lead that can do action the fight choreography wasnt great and looked like the main star had never thrown a punch before
Jul 20 2021,negative,pointless pandering to a non existing demographic
Jul 19 2021,negative,terrible movie  one of the worst superhero movies of all time  brie larson is awful
Jul 18 2021,positive,very decent underrated not too much wrong with the script fury is good just a little forgettable
Jul 17 2021,negative,pretty bland for a marvel film
Jul 17 2021,positive,brilliant movie although it was a bit spoiled by the trailers the biggest problem with this movie is that it came out right before endgame implying she was going to have a larger role a problem that no longer is a problem in this day and age  otherwise a great movie with some great surprisingly familiar faces
Jul 17 2021,positive,i really enjoyed it
Jul 16 2021,neutral,at times captain marvel feels like another one of those live action disney movies because of the ridiculous story
Jul 15 2021,positive,i still feel lucky to see a bad box office super hero movie so i cant complain about an average super hero movie so i feel no apprehension adding a point for subject matter it just is what it is if you like marvel movies its fine if you dont care about marvel movies i understand not wanting to watch it
Jul 15 2021,positive,i enjoyed the movie very much it felt like a usual marvel movie but it also has a different feel to it the movie showcases the journey carol danvers goes through to discover her past and find out who she really is many people disliked brie larsons acting but i found no fault in it she has tried her best with the script provided to her i would not blame misogyny for its poor audience rating but i think people are giving it a lot of unwanted flak   i personally found it quite interesting id recommend it
Jul 15 2021,negative,disappointing in terms of acting the costumes and storyline was decent easily understandable plot and looks like captain marvel was before all the movies but im confused with captain america he was before but probably around but they havent discover him yet since fury was only starting to create the shield after mar vell the scientist
Jul 13 2021,positive,wow what an amazing movie brie fited so perfectly in this character i loved it sooo much
Jul 13 2021,negative,this was just painful to watch because i can is just not a plot
Jul 13 2021,positive,thought it was a great film acting was excellent good writing  great musicsound design
Jul 12 2021,negative,captain marvel fails to deliver an engaging origin story due to lack of any kind of charisma from its titular character and antagonists  the only strong point being to showcase nick furys past
Jul 12 2021,negative,not an absolutely terrible movie but also not close to being a good movie the skrulls made the movie watchable no offense to brie larson i like her portrayal of captain marvel but not really an enjoyable movie although there was some nice humor
Jul 11 2021,positive,thoroughly enjoyed larson is a badass
Jul 10 2021,negative,larson is the worst part of the movie
Jul 9 2021,negative,poorly developed characters thin plot average special effects i feel like marvel are taking my support for granted
Jul 6 2021,negative,its hard to like a movie when you dont like the main character
Jul 6 2021,negative,this movie is disappointing and doesnt live up to the other marvel movies
Jul 5 2021,negative,it had potential but unfortunately the goal of this movie was to empower women not entertain so it comes off as annoying empty and pointless
Jul 5 2021,positive,this was partially a nick fury prequel what is there not to like
Jul 4 2021,negative,did not enjoy this movie brie larson is just a terrible actress
Jul 4 2021,negative,dont waste your time with this horrible movie  worst marvel movie ever
Jul 4 2021,negative,unlikable invincible protagonist forgettable villain no tension boring action scenes and a little too preachy and on the nose with its message
Jul 3 2021,negative,predictable plot and a shallow hero with no meaningful character or development
Jul 2 2021,negative,worst failure in the history of the modern mcu totally unrelated to source material terrible acting more interested in scoring political points than storytelling i could spend hours talking about why this movie was terrible
Jun 29 2021,negative,pretty boring cant really get attached to the characters in this one i was told the cat was the best part of the film meh maybe if it were a dog
Jun 28 2021,neutral,disclaimer im new to marvel watching everything in chronological order so perhaps thats why this movie doesnt do much for me it served a purpose of introducing a lot of important marvel backstory with nick fury shield monica rambeau and the tesseract its not a bad movie just doesnt have many if any rewatchable features i felt confused most the entire time and still finished somewhat confused  this is my first introduction to kree and skrull and im still not convinced the goal of each and who is really the goodbay guy maybe this movie will mean more once i know more about the marvel universe otherwise it doesnt survive as a standalone film
Jun 28 2021,neutral,definitely not the best marvel movie some scenes are just impossible to follow and the story still leaves you asking questions i do like some of the characters in this movie though but sometimes carol danvers can be extremely boring to watch over two and a half hours
Jun 27 2021,negative,overrated super heroine 
Jun 26 2021,negative,it doesnt get much worse than this dumpster fire another big budget cgi monstrosity with no plot horrible acting and writing cartoonish action sequences and an unintentionally hilarious star when will the studio drones realize cgi does not make a story these infantile comic book movies need to stop its over
Jun 22 2021,positive,good movie 710 but i did not like the villian
Jun 22 2021,negative,ugh terrible script terrible acting no character development 
Jun 20 2021,negative,worst movies so far from marvel studios
Jun 20 2021,positive,i loved this movie i watch it often i dont find it rush or anything i found it interesting throughout the whole movie
Jun 16 2021,negative,probably one of the two worst movies so far from marvel studios brie larson is unlikeable and the story is pretty naff  seems like it was just shoehorned in before endgame
Jun 12 2021,positive,this is one of my favourite movies just because this is one of the only movies i keep rewatching because of the boost of energy it gives me and it makes me feel like im on top of the world and nobody can stop me
Jun 11 2021,positive,this movie is really great there is an interesting twist villain who still gets time to be evil definitely watch this movie i personally dont hate brie larson and i like the captain marvel character and it doesnt make a difference being female rather than male
Jun 10 2021,negative,anyone who knows me knows that i despise this movie i really really really really dont like captain marvel but i do like captain marvel as a comic book character typically as a villain civil war ii is a flawed comic it doesnt have the same political issue that made you think because both sides of the argument couldve been right but civil war ii made captain marvel a villain did it do justice to her character im not sure i dont read captain marvel did make her interesting to me oh yea i love villains and seeing captain marvel as one is really cool she was a tyrannical person who didnt care about anybody elses thoughts because she thought she was right kinda sums up brie larsons personality was she right no not even close now why am i rambling on about civil war ii because thats the most interesting captain marvel to me contrasted to this one which i despise the main character doesnt carry the movie if anyone does its the sidecharacters nick fury samuel l jackson talos ben mendolsohn and maria rambeau lashana lynch i watched this movie because they were interesting to me  brie larson took the most boring approach to playing the character in this film i was bored watching this movie and brie larson can do some pretty good acting but her as captain marvel just did not jive with my funky fly soul that was an attempt at comedy and the writing it is not good its not like mortal kombat annihilation terrible but its not good its basically the bourne identity but without the stakes without the emotion and without the substance it just copies the tried amnesia trope over and over it doesnt really seem to fit the cinematography isnt really that great the best shot in this movie isnt really that good and all these criticisms break my heart because there are little girls out there who love captain marvel and see her as a role model and then when her movie releases captain marvels new nickname is space karen and it seems as if the writers purposely tried to make captain marvel entitled as possible there are no stakes because shes so powerful she has no emotional problems she just cruises right through the movie so i didnt like this film it saddened me good night sleep tight dont let edward cullen bite
May 31 2021,negative,a sub par plot with bland characters even jude law and annette benning seem to be bored by their characters and at least these two have demonstrated they can have charisma
May 31 2021,neutral,dont know where to start the movie dragged and could have been better 
May 27 2021,neutral,captain marvel was okay the movie has a very good start but similar to thor the movie falls off when carol danvers gets to earth the story itself isnt that great and most of the time really boring what i like though is the chemistry between brie larson and samuel l jackson all in all i give this movie a 255 stars
May 26 2021,negative,my main gripe is that the protagonist is uninteresting a knowitall and has little to no character arc while this is not the worst movie ever made it is certainly the worst of the mcu dont bother
May 26 2021,negative,note to writers  audiences tend to enjoy identifiable characters who are developed through the script and interesting plots  this isnt it
May 25 2021,positive,it just felt sort of generic and seemed to conclude nothing all it did was introduce captain marvel and the skrulls for other projects also captain marvel could have been may better cast as i dont care to see her in the future mcu that much rating c
May 23 2021,positive,samuel l jackson is great in this movie but all the rest is nothing more than ok
May 23 2021,positive,its perfect brie larson did amazing in it you have to watch it
May 19 2021,negative,this was a disappointment the skrull plot was a good idea but the rest of the story was just bad and uninspited for example who came up with the story on how fury lost his eye the main character is a total mary sue with no real development
May 18 2021,negative,the best part of the movie was learning how nick fury loses an eye the visuals were good but action sequences were forgettable as was the plot this is an origin story without substance or character development captain marvels training is done off screen so we dont have an opportunity to see how her abilities first manifest or how she copes its a slap dash mad rush to the end and youll not be given the time or incentive to get emotionally involved
May 17 2021,negative,i just didnt like this very much captain marvels character wasnt very relatable almost seemed like a villain at certain points and it was mostly forgettable i dont really care too much for brie larson though the room was really good imo but i was willing to give it a chance def wont be seeing the sequel
May 17 2021,negative,i really wanted to like marvel as she is one of my favourite comic book characters but i felt preached to
May 16 2021,negative,boring and predictable irrelevant for mcu
May 15 2021,positive,i loved bree larson  captain marvel is a great addition to the marvel universe the movie had just the right amount of girl power messages and i loved the references to older action movies
May 13 2021,positive,i think is fenomenal because the hero born from dificulties and not worrie about gender
May 11 2021,positive,it is an amazing movie just amazing and empowering the man just have to back off and dont be so intimidated by females
May 11 2021,positive,this movie had a lot of fun elements samuel l jackson was on point as usual but im unsure about our protagonist brie larson has the chops to headline any major franchise but i cant tell if it was the script issue or how the characterization was done by the actor that made me kind of dislike the lead it felt like there was no real relatability or development in her character its extremely hard to get emotionally attached to someone that is overpowered the struggle of the character can help add nuance and development i hope in the sequel that they give her more depth
May 9 2021,negative,ughoverpowered and over acted painful at times to say the least
May 7 2021,positive,follows the typical marvel formula which had be disappointing so deep into phase three but it still makes for a fun movie the format can be slightly disoriented on a first view but only gets better the more you watch it the deaging of samuel l jacksons nick fury is seamless and the transition of the skulls from antagonists to protagonists is unexpected both brie larson and carol danvers get unnecessary hate for an actress and character that are both great in this film the movie has its issues but its still a fun movie in any mcu marathon
May 6 2021,negative,hated itin every way possible especially bree larson
May 6 2021,positive,loved it i was surprised i actually enjoyed it im not usually into female leads but she did very well
May 5 2021,negative,if you want to watch a badass female action heroine who is a good role model for young girls go watch alita battle angel     in captain marvel rather than the best qualities of strong women the protagonist epitomizes the worst qualities of insecure men
May 5 2021,positive,had some actual funny moments this movie was decent
May 4 2021,negative,its bad realy bad way to much oneliners
May 4 2021,negative,worst in the mcu brie larson is extremely unlikable in this role 
May 4 2021,negative,this movie falls short in several areas  brie larson gives a wooden performance and has almost zero personality  nick fury the mastermind of the avengers and brilliant tactician is left following her around apparently at a loss for what to do unless carol tells him and then has his eye taken out by a cat  then when carol unleashes her full strength she becomes this unstoppable force and wipes everyone out  no chemistry no consequences and almost nothing to advance the mcu  dont waste your time
May 4 2021,positive,with its funny moments and awesome actions scenes this is not a bad movie and also i love overpowered characters so seeing captain marvel as one is awesome
May 3 2021,negative,first mcu movie i genuinely disliked to my heart
May 3 2021,positive,why is this movie hated its fucking fantastic
May 3 2021,negative,had to watch this when theres nothing else to watch  if only it wasnt part of marvel story line the 1st marvel movie that i hate it
May 2 2021,negative,i wasted my half an hour than i decided to not to waste more time on this third class movie nonsense acting and storyline
May 1 2021,negative,terrible film even shazam better then this
Apr 30 2021,negative,definitely the worst movie of the marvel universe no character arc the typical vague story brie larsen is probably the most unlikable actress to play a super hero it definitely doesnt help that the captain marvel is a horrible character in this movie in the comics  somewhat ok thanks for robbing me of my time
Apr 30 2021,negative,why oh why havent i checked viewers opinions on rottentomatoes first    embarassing a complete disappointment not in line with the franchise storyline at all just another try to squeeze out some cash out of the faithful fans could not exist at all
Apr 29 2021,negative,the main character or hero is totally unlikeable i found her acting and the script to be grating
Apr 28 2021,negative,we are used to classical marvel films with ups and downs but still amazing movies captain marvel on the other hand really disappointed every marvel hero has flaws and they were not shy to show them just look at stony romanov and banner for example  carol danvers on the other hand is the embodiment of perfection and is represented as such for me its just another attempt at getting a strong lead character by brute force please look at rouge one star wars the clone wars and even the ironman trilogy and black pather there is no need to force anything
Apr 28 2021,negative,captain marvel is a lifeless overpowered mary sue who we are told throughout the movie is a good funny smart person but this is not shown at any point in the movie she is told constantly that she is out of control of her emotions but she shows less emotional range than bella swan in the first twilight film     the whole movie is a petty men bad women good without any real soul by the end you have no real investment in her character and her presence in endgame spat in the face of all the characterisation and heart given to every other character     if you want to write a strong female character look to black widow and take notes
Apr 27 2021,negative,worst marvel movie ever created nothing memorable nothing epic and more of those stupid jokes make this movie the worst superheroes movie
Apr 25 2021,negative,the biggest set back of this movie all revolves around brie larson and the character of captain marvel     brie larsons acting in this movie is subpar she shows almost ability to accurately display different emotions depending on the situation her performance was very much lack luster to me  for the character of captain marvel there is no way to connect with the character instead of seeing and feeling her faults we are told them not to mention she has zero weaknesses the climax fight of the movie didnt feel like a climax i knew she was going to win and nothing could be done to stop her     for a superhero movie to be successful there has to be doubt and fear that the hero will prevail although we know they will win because it is a superhero movie all heros have some weakness ie superman  kryptonite ironmanbatman  mortal  even thor who is a god can be injured and killed
Apr 24 2021,positive,great action that is nicely adapted to the many different environments in this film brie larson has a strong leading presence and great chemistry with samuel l jacksons nick fury the movie tells a great self contained story about self discovery and friendship wile also revealing the larger cosmic world of the mcu giving us context to events that happened throughout the franchise making this a must watch for any marvel fan excelsior
Apr 24 2021,positive,my favorite superhero i love this character storyline and all things captain marvel i need to see more of her in future avenger movies girl power all the way
Apr 24 2021,negative,whatever captain marvel does in the movie is not heroic she is arrogant and reckless also the whole movie is focused on virtue signaling the whole movie is based on captain marvel trying to prove that she is better than the men around her other than that she has no personality
Apr 23 2021,positive,a fine movie the story is decent and there are some nice side characters still the film lacks proper tension and the fact that captain marvel doesnt face real opposition hurts the movie as well as the greater universe as it very much makes her a deus ex machina in the broader context of the mcu
Apr 23 2021,neutral,the passionless directing and flimsy editing really hold this movie back there are strong moments and story beats that keep it from completely sinking but its one of marvels most underwhelming efforts to date    full review 
Apr 23 2021,negative,some movies are just completely forgettable like thor 2 forgettable this one compounds this with just some really bad story telling captain marvel gets no arc in the story nothing can touch her nothing is at risk for her so she ends up being boring it does not help that brie larson plays her so flat making her even less compelling and less likely to be remembered the cat in this movie has a bigger arc than the main character perhaps the lead could have been portrayed better through improved direction or a better script  but clearly one of the glaring shortcomings of this flick is the script aside from abandoning the core tenants of what makes for a good story there is plenty here that just plain makes no sense if you are not paying for it and you just need some background sounds while you are focused on working you will likely get more out of this film than if you actually paid attention to it
Apr 22 2021,negative,this movie is just propaganda the story is full of holes and the protagonist my god this protagonist dont have any personality whatsoever and it dont improve after the challenges that this mc go through during the movie the movie can be summarized into op mc punches and lasers things
Apr 22 2021,negative,i love marvel movies ive seen them all this one was the rare exception wish i could get my money and time back horribly miscast lead
Apr 22 2021,negative,this was just a bad movie no not because it was woke trash like many have said about it but because it simply falls flat on having a strong main character and that i place the blame solely on the casting of captain marvelbrie larson and disneys behind the scenes producerdirector choices    there are so many better choices for a female lead and its a crying shame that this was the first marvel mcu movie to feature a female lead and not black widowscarlett johansson  those that criticize the marvel fans that have enjoyed all or most previous films in the mcu but disliked this were placing the blame solely on those being sexist or simply not supporting female leads my argument to that is that we simply dont like larson for the role the character is fine though flawed in terms of writing while a superman type character that is overpowered and needs a kryptonite or excuse to be absent in order to bring some believability or situational danger to keep things interesting when they can merely super punch or fly through a villain rather than struggle  larsons acting is very flat and stiff in this film both my wife and i were uninterested in her characters journey as we felt no connection or empathy towards her due to the actors inability to convey a wide array of emotions it had nothing to do with her being one of the most powerful superheroes introduced thus far  we felt the same upon her return in the avengers movies that wrapped up the infinity stones story line she was just there for lack of a better term to describe her presence it was cool to see her spoilers take out thanos ship at the end that may have been the only time that i was somewhat interested in her actions in the movie and how she stood up to thanos when he had all the stones in the gauntlet but at the same time several other characters were able to stand up to thanos who were mortal captain america and inflict damage to him scarlett witch at other parts so it wasnt exceptional we have no interest in seeing a sequel with her in it    the captain marvel movie to me was good only because of the 90s setting soundtrack and nostalgia references along with deaged coulson and fury other than that i was rather bored watching this one  wonder woman was a much better female lead superhero flick
Apr 20 2021,positive,captain marvel does seem like a rushed film in terms of character growth and development compared to other mcu films but the same lovable quality and charm is still present throughout the film it is refreshing to see another side to nick fury that we have yet to see in other movies the friendship between these two characters is fantastic and the chemistry is delightful captain marvel overall is a delightful addition to the mcu and i am excited for future appearances from brie larson
Apr 20 2021,neutral,just as boring and bland as any other marvel movie
Apr 19 2021,negative,boring and not creative 
Apr 18 2021,negative,was just straight up boring
Apr 18 2021,negative,for a character who is supposed to be the strongest captain marvel is the least inspiring and has the weakest character and story arc 
Apr 18 2021,negative,not fun at all    the character is invincible and arrogant as f    there is no learning or fun at the storydrama
Apr 18 2021,negative,just a bad movie i did not like the plot the acting i was bored most of the movie i cant say what cuit was off
Apr 18 2021,positive,a very underrated marvel movie that everyone needs to see
Apr 17 2021,negative,a very good movie in presentation and visual effects but a terrible message even breaking with basic narration rules  like so many movies these days    i wont mention on visuals because they are great this is no surprise as cm is not the first marvel movie so you can expect this what worries me is the character arc its said carol danvers has a weakness she needs to overcome fair enough but the revelation is she never really had this weakness she was op all along and acknowledging this costs her literally nothing a man is responsible for her weakness and she needs to liberate from that so the basic message is selfempowerment this paints a very bad picture because there either is no overall message for people watching or the message is to liberate yourself from oppression holding you donw sounds familiar its as awful as it sounds
Apr 17 2021,positive,this movie is overhated it was pretty good especially nick fury
Apr 17 2021,negative,brie larson is so one dimensional she seems like the typical non humorous robot people our society produces now and she carries that into her acting  the plot was dumbthe kreeskrull war was more like skrulls running scared than the enemy mine hatred they have for each other in the comics    the best part is being in the shoes of the kree in the beginning with ronin on your side fighting other than that bries acting was a big fate disappointment marvel missed the mark in this one
Apr 16 2021,negative,naw when a movie becomes heavy in political attitude its not worth watching i watched it regretted it
Apr 15 2021,neutral,ive recently started watching all the marvel films in timeline order and this is the 2nd one on the list samuel l jackson was great as nick fury and brie larson is a good actress but i just couldnt get into this film im a fan of superhero movies and the marvel movies but this one was very longwinded and boring the actors in the film were all good but the story was not it seemed to lack that marvel magic it passed the time but i wont be watching again and again like i have with other superhero and marvel movies
Apr 15 2021,negative,literally a complete waste of carol danvers an awesome character played awfully in a messy and condescending film
Apr 15 2021,negative,is very not original very weird vibe
Apr 13 2021,negative,i tried to be subjective and find redeeming qualities in this movie but it is so boring it plays like it was was written by a kid trying to act smart
Apr 12 2021,negative,there is a lot to learn still from ancient scripts and plays when the computer is more important than human creativity which cleary needs time trial and error and will never be perfect this is the result i remember script session they were months long then you went into preproduction and i am talking script draft no 39 so many years before the story was born then nurtured and now had reached its maturity so we would consider a shoot these days movies are produced like video games latter are also getting worst no story no intellectual thought just statement after statement and senseless action remember how hitchcock could make you move with only one sound
Apr 12 2021,positive,marvel gives audiences a powerful lead woman for the first time since its film series debut in 2008 after many powerful female supporting roles from black widow scarlett johansson wanda elizabeth olsen gamora vanessa marshall and more the mcu has finally introduced a movie with a female lead captain marvels origin story is very interesting and the 90s vibe throughout the film is lovely samuel l jackson as larsons supporting role does phenomenal and the film proves he needs more screen time in the future
Apr 11 2021,negative,some issues   1 uncharismatic lifeless lead one could say its part of the plot and totally in character but that doesnt change the fact that she is boring  2 boringly overpowered main character theres a reason why kryptonite exists its about the only way to introduce any suspense to a superman story  and still its tough to tell a superman story without a similarly overpowered monstervillain theres a reason why the best thor movie is the one wherein he loses his hammer and doesnt even personally defeat the enemy  3 uncompelling easilydispatched big bad a direct result of having such an overpowered protagonist and exacerbated by pitting them against a much weaker antagonist thats why you end up with such an anticlimactic final battle with zero stakes    other than that good idea to cash in on nostalgia by setting the movie when they did great to have a femaleled mcu movie nice introduction to kree and skrulls that could potentially be explored further in later moviesstorylines a deaged samuel l jackson despite moving like an old man is not bad and there was a ton of great acting from all the other charactersactors
Apr 9 2021,negative,its a disaster of a movie that is horribly written and has no good redeeming qualities a waste of time is an understatement
Apr 9 2021,positive,i like the action and it had some good scenes
Apr 9 2021,negative,shallow no character development
Apr 9 2021,negative,horrible movie nothing interesting about the main character destroys several plotlines from the actual good marvel films changing the main characters gender for more audience support is also weak oh and nick furys line about his eye makes absolutely no sense now do not watch this unless you are prepared to mock it
Apr 8 2021,positive,i think all of the other ratings are pure sexism captain marvel is probably one of my top 10 favorite marvel films it had the right amount of action and comedy that every marvel movie usually has i liked the backstory of carol danvers it was interesting i liked the theme of the movie and the time period it was in i love the blockbuster scene it was enjoyable for someone who grew up with blockbuster and grew up with a family that went to blockbuster a lot i liked the nirvana mentions those were enjoyable being a fan of nirvana myself overall i think everyone should watch the captain marvel movie super excited for the second one cannot wait to see where they take her character and any other character they bring in
Apr 6 2021,negative,dissapointing for a marvel movie brie larsons acting is terrible unless captain marvel is supposed to be emotionless robot
Apr 5 2021,negative,a wholly unnecessary prequel movie that only serves to shoein a new hero that is barely in the avengers films anyway  the film has its moments but those are usually moments that dont include captain marvel herself
Apr 4 2021,positive,one of the worst marvel movies lots of plotholes at least its fun
Apr 4 2021,negative,poor character development unrealistic arcs forced rushed time i can never get back this movie is the moment i lost faith in marvel movies and why i wait for them to hit dvd now
Apr 2 2021,negative,what even is this trash of a movie bries performance was flat when compared to infinity war and endgame the action sequences are dead boring and the plot feels like a whole bunch of bs
Apr 2 2021,positive,alright in all honesty i dont see why audiences hate captain marvel a lot i thought it was an amazing female superhero movie
Apr 1 2021,negative,this movie is likely the worst of the mcu the acting from larson was wooden the plot made little sense and much of the dialogue had me cringing in my seat the character of nick fury in captain marvel is wholly inconsistent with what the mcu has established for him  the action and the fight scenes were decent and that is probably the only partially redeeming quality of this movie
Apr 1 2021,positive,i genuinely expected more from the captain marvel character cause after the infinity war she was built up as the gamechanger she really wasnt but theyre stuff i can get behind  stuff they failed at one of those is what happens to nick furys eye i expected better because of a comment he makes about it in an avengers movie
Apr 1 2021,negative,worst marvel movie of all time    critics giving it a thumbs up please   so boring and lame    wonderwoman is way way better
Mar 31 2021,positive,despite the common opinion its a good movie it is definitely flawed but still very good the lead is kinda boring but the action is enjoyable and getting to learn more about nick fury and see agent coulson is a treat it has an intriguing story with some phenomenal world building goose is adorable and the references are great its a fun watch overall
Mar 30 2021,negative,clearly marvels attempt to compete with dcs far superior wonderwoman waste of time and money thanks a lot marvel
Mar 30 2021,negative,the movie was very boring and the movies plot twist was very predictable
Mar 30 2021,negative,the worst movie of the mcu
Mar 29 2021,positive,fantastic    i recommend to you 
Mar 28 2021,negative,so terrible worst movie out side of the terrible ghostbusters 2016
Mar 26 2021,negative,i really tried to enjoy this movie but it was so boring i almost felt sleep a lot of times it has 12 interesting concepts but thats it
Mar 26 2021,positive,i have always had a negative opinion of this film however upon watching it a second time i realised i vastly underestimated it this movie blows many others in the mcu out of the water including the first thor films and many others the main issue i see is that marvel introduced captain marvel late in the game as well as the sexism that arises from a strong female character after all the rhetoric i had seen about marvels cockiness i had expected her to be unbearable but while watching all i saw was a person who had been taught her whole remembered life that the people on earth were below her and that she was a powerful soldier defending her planet not only was her attitude understandable i found it enjoyable and watching her not stand for injustices thrown her way was refreshing and welcome overall i think this movie was great and while there may be valid criticisms a 23 score is ridiculous and shows how many marvel fans view the first female based superhero film
Mar 26 2021,negative,oof captain marvel is awful the lead character is bland the action is forgettable it opens up new inconsistencies in the timeline they turn nick fury into a joke and it just was at the end of the day mediocre at best i dont understand how one can call this a great movie
Mar 25 2021,negative,this movie was pointless putting aside the terrible person that is larson the movie just fell flat and forced the cat was maybe the best part and that is not a good thing they need to can this movie character and whoever wrote itdirected it i will not watch a sequel if made
Mar 24 2021,negative,boring it sucks it sucks so bad baddest movie of the mcu period
Mar 23 2021,negative,big budget movie that gives more of the same
Mar 23 2021,positive,this movie gets to much hate its not amazing but its really good
Mar 23 2021,neutral,even worse than incredible hulk and thor 2  thats saying a lot
Mar 22 2021,neutral,while not as bad as others may make it seem captain marvel is still a dull experience due to a lack of entertaining action and a wooden performance from brie larson
Mar 21 2021,negative,the best scene are with the cat what are you thinking top  critics give this shiit a certifed fresh please it sucks
Mar 21 2021,negative,one of the worst marvel films made
Mar 21 2021,negative,such a boring ass movie
Mar 20 2021,negative,im not sure how or why this got so many high scores from critics this is one of marvels dumbest movies in my opinion at least plotwise there was so many plot holes that is started to give me a headache like a patch stopping her powers because she didnt believe or something like that also this movie made nick fury line in avengers week the kree and the scroll are now extremely incompetent ect this movie honestly suffers from plot stupidity
Mar 20 2021,negative,this movie sucks eggs
Mar 20 2021,positive,the movie was great it got great action scenes and heartfelt moral about knowing who you are that we shouldnt let anyone control what feel or do
Mar 19 2021,negative,worst marvel movie so far 
Mar 19 2021,negative,one of the worst movie ive seen was boring and unoriginal
Mar 19 2021,negative,i enjoyed parts of the movie but for the most part its just brie larson being the most wooden character in mcu history she needed to be more diverse instead of 3 emotions anger happy and rebel which can work for a character if written well the main issue comes with the fact that we know as much as carol danvers about who she is which on paper sounds like a great idea but doesnt translate well to screen    but the biggest crime is how they made nick fury lose his eye to a cat all for the sake of a joke nobody laughed at
Mar 19 2021,negative,waste of movie they should stop while they are ahead
Mar 19 2021,negative,this was just weird really really weird
Mar 19 2021,positive,its not as bad as everyone says  must watch it an overall good film
Mar 19 2021,negative,uhmwhat the hell was this   dont waste your time with this regardless if you are an mcu fan or looking for a female action film  poor direction poor acting and script is atrocious  brie larson has as much personality and acting ability as a plank of mdf  watch wonder woman  until the third actthen switch off or atomic blonde instead
Mar 18 2021,negative,i cant remember any thing after watching this f movie
Mar 18 2021,positive,gave 5 star for being the best femaleled superhero movie it has the best action scenes3rd actvillains in this category btw
Mar 18 2021,negative,nothing special artificial development of storylinecharacters
Mar 18 2021,positive,it was a long time coming but this is the femal led superhero movie i think many of us were waiting for it was an exciting addition to the marvel universe and added depth to characters weve seen before it also sets up possible story avenues that with a new light
Mar 18 2021,negative,worse marvel movie so far  i didnt like how brie larson acted  at the beginning of the movie she is described as hot tempered but there is not a single moment where this aspect is seen probably the script didnt help she is strong  and quite boring  from the beginning to the end of the movie
Mar 18 2021,negative,the score was bad during the fight scene it got on my nerve the acting was so so bad and brie larson did not fit the role of captain marvel
Mar 17 2021,positive,i saw this movie in theaters and i cant say that it was my favorite marvel movie but it sticks to the mcu formula well enough to produce another solid one     this movie is on par with the mcu as a whole which gives this movie the extra boost that it needs to stay fresh otherwise this movie wouldnt be very good at all the comedy is pretty good exactly what youve come to expect form marvel the characters in this movie were rather a mixed bag for me for the protagonist in particular ill get to that in a moment i genuinely enjoyed watching most of the characters though some are far more rounded than others the story is plain enough and adds just enough nostalgia from past mcu movies to keep true fans invested causal viewers will be pleased the most with your typical third act cgifest     i was rather disappointed with how marvel handled the character captain marvel i understand that the directors adapted her just as she is in the comics that isnt my main gripe im more concerned with her lack of character development throughout the movie carol danvers played by brie larson has some compelling motivation is to prove wrong all of her doubters as one strong female lead ought to and this was a large victory for empowering women everywhere but why doesnt her character change by the time that the film is over at the beginning of the movie shes kicking butt getting up when shes thrown down and trying to remember who she is because shes been brainwashed by the twist villain at the end of the movie shes kicking more butt getting up when shes thrown down and remembers enough of her past to take down the twist villain yet she doesnt learn anything about herself she keeps doing what shes always done carol danvers doesnt go through any emotional or internal character arc which absolutely shocked me given marvels oscarworthy demonstration of story telling in black panther if im being completely honest i felt shortchanged captain marvel deserved better than this i understand that captain marvel is a hard character to adapt to the bigscreen in terms of personality and the extreme level of her cosmic powers but ive come to expect so much from marvel that i was disappointed    if you have enjoyed mcu films thus far you will find this one to be a hit as well despite an unfortunately shallow protagonist this movie manages to rise above that problem to become an average mcu film
Mar 16 2021,negative,i fell asleep watching this movie on several separate attempts at watching it either multiple postmates workers slipped me sedatives or this blows
Mar 16 2021,negative,like the character didnt like the storyline
Mar 14 2021,positive,i dont understand the negativity towards captain marvel its not one of the greatest marvel films but it is a satisfying and solid beginning for the character    i thought brie larson was great looking forward to the sequel
Mar 14 2021,positive,i love the character i love the comics i read and i really wanted to love this more than i did its a watchable movie but its not the great cinematic introduction the character herself could have had
Mar 14 2021,positive,finally got to watch it  its pretty good but i could never figure out just where that darn cat came from  also its good to see where nick fury finally got his patch from a cat scratch
Mar 13 2021,negative,was this movie supposed to carry the avengers franchise  it was just a mess of horrible character and plot development
Mar 13 2021,positive,this movie was better the second time around and features an excellent cast but is let down by a plot and script that let down the characters it revolves around
Mar 12 2021,negative,the weakest marvel movie of the whole bunch the main actress is bad and not relatable
Mar 12 2021,positive,captain marvel was pretty meh and uneventful midtier marvel movie and when comparing female superheros i actually give dc the advantage thus far with wonder woman over this the 90s nostalgia was overdone and was trying too hard to be cool and retro soundtrack at times felt out of place
Mar 9 2021,negative,soulless and lifeless disappointing     the writers and directors had an amazing opportunity to showcase a bit of mcu backstory but they completely bungled it
Mar 9 2021,positive,great storyline i love brie larson too my favorite part about this movie is that it focuses on emotional challenges while still including the classic marvel action samuel l jackson jude law and lashana lynch are gold
Mar 9 2021,negative,ugh this is my least favorite marvel movie sam jackson was its only saving grace and not even he could come close to its salvation the characters are cookie cutters bland boring and forgettable the action wasnt that thrilling it was so slow paced and any attempt at comedy fell so flat they explain how nick fury lost his eye in this movie and i hate it to my very core that should not have happened i dont care if it was comic book accurate it was stupid but this movies biggest problem is the title charterer herself big emphasis on the her because the only thing captain marvel has in this movie is she is a powerful strong female i have seen more personality in a paper clip thats not entirely the actresses fault captain marvel is just not an interesting character period i have hated this movie for a while but i could never figure out why minus nick furys loss of an eye but today i finally figured it out this movie represents every over played female empowerment hollywood cliche that draws attention to a girl who was a hero not a hero who was a girl there is a difference a character should be likable have a personality you want to see them succeeded the movie however was so focused on making her an icon for 5 year old girls that they forgot to make her a character and thats what i hate i hate bland pieces of bread focused on saying girls rule without anything interesting behind it even worse this studio gave us some of my favorite hero girls from scarlet witch to gamora to black widow i hope marvel can get back on there female game with black widow because on my next rewatch im skipping this uninspired mess that they call an mcu movie       nostalgia critic said it first in a kim possible review it was a really good phrase so i used it
Mar 8 2021,positive,a superhero movie thats not mainly about being a superhero and once you accept that its way easier to appreciate this film for what it is at its heart captain marvel is an actionmystery in the vein of the davinci code or maybe bourne about friendship family justice and kickass women and a notcat named goose of course there are some gripes about shoehorning this retroactively into the mcu that cant really be blamed on this movie i guess the events of avengers 1 dont count as an emergency slj and larson play together fabulously carol danvers takes no bullshit and im here for it    5 flerken flerkens out of 5
Mar 8 2021,negative,too boring  clichéd
Mar 8 2021,positive,dont care what anyone says i love this movie and brie larson is perfect cant wait for cm 2
Mar 6 2021,negative,protagonist without charisma mediocre villains this film is perhaps the worst that marvel studios has done
Mar 4 2021,positive,this is a likeable addition to the marvel cinematic universe in what was to become the final solo entry before the much awaited end game the film centres on captain marvel discovering who she was and who she is to become to establish her place in the universe we see nick fury  samuel l jackson  take a central role in this film based in the 1990s and discover his development into head of shield operations the film suffers a little pacing issue as the first quarter of the film is a little slow to tell us who captain marvel was and unfortunately relies very heavily on cgi  that quickly dates  at the end of the film that said the feel of the 90s is achieved perfectly particularly with original videos on display in blockbuster and once we realise captain marvel was originally an abducted earthing the film takes a new turn and the film picks up the pace perfectly a fun movie with some good moments that in the end links us to nick fury at the end of avengers infinity war
Mar 1 2021,negative,this movie is a great example of a bad superhero movie i didnt feel in all the movie that the main character was in danger didnt see evolution didnt learn a lesson nothing is just an empty movie that tells us look how strong is captain marvel and the only script twist that you can have is ruined because de good ones that turn to be the bad ones are the bad ones of another movie the only reason for me to put 1 star instead of half to this movie is the apereance of agent coulson
Mar 1 2021,positive,shes absolutely badass if you hate her you are a real misogynist  it had great story line and an amazing plot she is the most powerful avenger because shes had years of practice shes not cocky shes tied to the roll just like anyone else great movie and i hope to see more of her
Mar 1 2021,positive,not a bad movie but just kinda average compared to other marvel movies this one lacks action comedy and emotion its hard to really like the captain marvel character when she was pretty much just shoved in our faces and said ok heres the future and shes the strongest samuel jackson was really good in his role 
Mar 1 2021,negative,i personally found her performance to be extremely hollow and in my opinion the character had little to no redeeming qualities
Feb 28 2021,negative,the usually reliable marvel studio shows that they can drop a clanger brie larson displays almost no emotion in what is just a bad rewrite of the first avenger terrible in almost every way half a star for some cool effects and halfhearted eighties nostalgia
Feb 26 2021,positive,i really loved this movie it really showed girl power and it is just a great story and really witty
Feb 25 2021,positive,many bash this movie for no reason at all besides misogyny believe me i use to be one of those people but when you put aside your bitterness and watch with an open mind you find a great movie with great actors i love marvel and this is another win for them cant wait for captain marvel 2
Feb 23 2021,negative,a very bland movie without a character that can be rooted for the lack of story depth proved the theory of marvel only relying action spectacles to sell their movies
Feb 22 2021,negative,this movie is a worse meh moment than the emoji movie it is also absolute cringe 
Feb 22 2021,negative,it was alright for the later half but something about this movie doesnt click with me like the rest of the marvel movies i feel like it was way to confusing at times i do hope to see captain marvel in the future her character has potential
Feb 19 2021,negative,this movie was awful  story line was forced  acting by lead was terrible  it added absolutely nothing to the marvel series  i fell dumber for having watched it  this movie was strictly a girl power insertion into marvel series  do not waste your time watching it  it would be better spent watching howard the duck
Feb 18 2021,negative,had some decent special effects and played a small role in moving the mcuthanos ball down the field but overall it was contrived incoherent gibberish of a plot carol danvers was presented as a daisy ridleyreytype character who has no flaws limitless power and someone whos biggest threat is the misogynist mansplaining patriarchy couple that with the realworld douchebaggery of brie larson and you have an unlikeable superhero who is played by an actress who most of the audience cant stand wonder woman was much better and while it had its own flaws they at least had a character plot and actress you could like enjoy and respect skip this movie if you havent already seen it 
Feb 17 2021,positive,i had my reservations about captain marvel after joining the marvel franchise late but i will say i was utterly impressed she had a great plot a nice character arch a good bit of action and a sense of comedic relief it was also great to finally understand furys backstory
Feb 16 2021,positive,i for one did not hate the movie as much as many others seemed to though i will admit giving your lead character amnesia and forcing them to show no emotion makes them fairly dull
Feb 16 2021,neutral,it was ok kinda underwhelming especially when she hardly appeared in endgame
Feb 15 2021,negative,extremely boring formulaic and uninteresting brie larson gave a terrible performance and shows she is not fit for this role
Feb 15 2021,positive,i really liked this movie it has a powerful charismatic performances i like brie in the movie i thought she was super the story and action was great
Feb 15 2021,positive,1010 love brie in this role
Feb 14 2021,positive,this movie was amazing a feminist icon
Feb 13 2021,negative,terrible choice for captain marvel and not the best way of showing a proper strongest of all time hero i would hope that marvel doesnt ride captain marvel into future phases cause boy oh boy is that ship gonna sink haardd
Feb 3 2021,positive,all things considered it was an enjoyable movie  was it as good or as rewatchable as iron man  not close  was it as bad as hulk  not close  personally id put it in the bottom half of the mcu movies  so why the four stars  well just because its not the best mcu movie it was still a good movie  maybe if it had been released back in phase 1 of the mcu instead of phase 3  i definitely look forward to cm2
Feb 3 2021,positive,this movie gets so much unnecessary hate the only real reason i can think of is to why is pure misogyny captain marvel is in no way pushing and agenda or just a girl power movie it is just as action packed funny and campy as any other marvel movie is this is a must watch in the franchise
Feb 3 2021,positive,though the movie is far from the mcus best esspetally when you conceder the fact that it was smushed in between two masterpieces this movies still gets an unfair amount of hate thrown at it much like the star wars sequel trilogy this movie is an unfortunate victim of sexist internet trolls who bash the movie for having a strong female protagonist but the good people all understand that this movie is an overall ok movie with just enough action to keep real fans entertained
Feb 1 2021,positive,its not the best mcu film but im gonna recommend it for its humorperformances and some action scenes
Feb 1 2021,negative,captain marvel represents everything wrong with hollywood and movies in general these days it seems to want to push a political agenda more so then entertain fans brie larson is just as unlikable in the film as she is in real life i love samuel l jackson as a person and as an actor but hes not the nick fury i grew up reading about in the comics especially his portrayal in this film hes reduced to a bumbling idiot along with half the other male actors for the sake of making carol looks like a stronger character and it just doesnt work     also in the comics monica rambeau was captain marvel decades before carol danvers yet in this film shes reduced to a secondary side character to staggering unpopular one im all for female empowerment but when its done correctly like in buffy the vampire slayer alien underworld resident evil wonder woman etc basically movies that empower females without turning all other male leads into bumbling idiots unlike this one    i also really dont get why marvel is turning popular white characters black instead of just using popular black characters its as if they think original black characters cant and wont work on film of something which is extremely insulting to say the least the film really wouldve been better off focusing on monica rambeau as captain marvel there are some positive elements of this film but not enough to subvert the giant slap in the face to fans of the source material
Feb 1 2021,positive,new and fun family film
Jan 31 2021,negative,completely bland and lacking of inspiration  marvel really could have done something amazing with this movies but instead messed up at nearly every step of the way  massive disappointment
Jan 16 2021,negative,this film is a disgrace to all the other movies marvel has released and i deeply dislike it with a passion i didnt even care to go to a cinema to see it and waited to rent it as cheaply as i could instead  the first movie about a female character should have been about black widow and her dark past especially since she dies on the next movie  scarlett johanson is a charismatic character and black widow is just amazing  captain marvel lacks charisma and her morality is questionable she beats up a guy and mugs him just because he hit on her like what type of hero does that and she is op  there are many plot holes plot armors and conveniences  also i cant believe that they emasculated nick fury   how dare they show us that a cat scratched his eye out  that is disrespectful to one of the most mysterious and cool characters ever
Jan 15 2021,positive,a good movie good visual effects i loved carol danversvers and nick fury one thing that could be better imo was a real villain i recommend
Jan 14 2021,positive,captain marvel is a really fun movie that i love however it may take a while for brie larson to fully get both feet on the ground with the carol danvers character but hey it took chris hemsworth 5 films and almost 7 years to become outstanding as thor
Jan 13 2021,positive,not the best mcu movie stunning visuals nice origin movie
Jan 4 2021,negative,god this movie was awful
Dec 31 2020,positive,best mcu movie  best origin story  brie larson is brielliant
Dec 31 2020,negative,attitude problem over powered inconsistent  thats basically it
Dec 31 2020,negative,when this was made it was the worst mcu movie made to date thank goodness marvel made endgame which they raised the disappointment bar to new heights  there was no character development and i mean at all the future captain went from great to great and never had to look inside herself for any retrospective never had a  worthy opponent which all equals boring  its so sad since introducing a new superhero is where mcu excelled in the previous heroes
Dec 31 2020,negative,pretty colors not much else going for it
Dec 30 2020,negative,horrible boring can no one write exciting movies any longer i dont know who brie larson is this is the first time i seen her but her acting is horrible
Dec 30 2020,positive,excellent film the plot is super tied the story is not told in a linear way and this ends up helping in the construction and development of the protagonist the interaction with the other characters in the film occurs naturally  and in the end its a good movie
Dec 30 2020,negative,ohh what a bland run of the mill and boring marvel movie this has to be the worst marvel flick i have watched and i have watched plenty marvel flicks brie larson in many scenes feels wooden uninspiring you have got to realize how bad a movie is if the most memorable scene involves a freakish cat rather than any of the main characters of the movie the story feels so lazy and done to death like thousands of times and bad screenplay does it no favor either as for acting jackson as usual was the shining star and ben mendelsohn has done surprisingly well considering heavy makeup he had to wear but most others fail to even register their presence as actors no disrespect towards their efforts though the dialogues werent memorable either now most marvel movies arent really known for powerful acting or dialogues but they still have a decent mix of screenplay action cgi and bit of comedy which provides great entertainment quotient to it making them enjoyable but this one failed spectacularly even in that department arguable the worst mcu movie
Dec 29 2020,positive,loved it soundtrack was amazing and the lead was kick ass overall a great movie that  i highly recommend
Dec 29 2020,negative,boring narrative cliche storyline nothing excited or interesting fight scenes
Dec 29 2020,positive,it was okay but certainly one of the weaker marvel movies there just wasnt anything that as overly good about it i would say see it with minimal expectations
Dec 29 2020,negative,on a scale of fail to failure i would give this a massive flop so much for woman power and rights when the creators cant think of something new and fresh without comanderring other works
Dec 28 2020,positive,brie larson was brielliant in this movie  oscar winner so no surprise  this movie gets better each time i watch it
Dec 28 2020,negative,first of all as a woman i dont really see this as a feminist movie rather a movie for women who see themselves over men that is not what equality means men and woman should be at the same leveland captain marvel was just an example of such a feminist movie     okay so i have a few issues with this movie the first being she has too much power that it doesnt even need to be a fight     so i understand that captain marvel is super powerful as ive read the comics but seriously so goes into a spaceship kills everyone and manages to destroy the ship while being handcuffed marvel has a way of being unrealistic but that just proves it all     second this feels like every other marvel movie ive seen dont get me working i love marvel but when it comes to doing things differently they aint it dc maybe has bad movies but you can see them doing different things at least captain marvel just reminds me of thorragnarok black phanter and most of the avenger movies nothing different    third i dont really know if it is brie larson or generally just the script but they are making her out to be emotionless in which i know that was the main idea of the movie but it is really upsetting that she doesnt change her emotions in the last fight her face is completely still while the dude is off screaming and showing emotions last time i checked it was the dud who told her to not use her emotions they got that really messed up    overall they did have a good plot but they didnt manage to do it right feels to me that they put it out there just to say you wont understand endgame if you dont watch this movie     compared to wonder woman this movie was absolute thrash
Dec 28 2020,negative,my thoughts on this movie it sucks not really its okay not amazing like some people say and not the worst movie i have ever seen its in the middle somewhere      there are things in this movie that are different from the comics some are the dumbest decisions made some wouldnt make a difference if they were the same as the comics and some are just well they seem forced the feminist message is okay sort of way less of a problem but there are some choices in the movie lets just say wonder woman does the female hero thing a bit better   then there are the villains of the movie no spoilers but they arent great either   is the movie great no is it terrible no its almost the middle of the road
Dec 28 2020,negative,very bad movie save your time and dont watch it
Dec 28 2020,positive,i really enjoyed this movie great special effects and a good story
Dec 28 2020,negative,this is a movie it has a weak plot bad acting biggest eye rolls ever its terrible but it has a startmiddleend so its not a complete dumpster fire that makes barely any sense like star wars episode 9 but its right there at the bottom with thor 2 and incredible hulk
Dec 28 2020,negative,it wasnt worth watching very political
Dec 26 2020,negative,captain marvel adds nothing new to the mcu just another mcu movie whos only unique quality is that it is the first female lead superhero movie set in the mcu
Dec 26 2020,positive,typical superhero film 
Dec 16 2020,negative,it was more annoying than entertaining could have been been casted a lot better
Dec 1 2020,negative,i wouldnt watch this movie again but it wasnt offensive or particularly scandalous just meh 
Nov 27 2020,negative,bland and forgettable mediocre in many levels
Nov 26 2020,positive,the cgi used on samuel l jackson and clark gregg to make them look younger looks outstanding so overall this is a fun movie that gives more backstory on the tesseract and has an excellent cast with ben mendehlson and jude law added
Nov 24 2020,negative,oof that was rotten hope to see something more of matter in next movie from marvel
Nov 24 2020,negative,the main hero of the story never had to really try to win  there was no real conflict that the main character had to over due to her op plot armor  she got her powers from an alien trying to build a light speed engine but they already had light speed or faster engines because they were traveling to different galaxies in no time  poorly written and cringey
Nov 24 2020,negative,it was fine the first time i watched it and im a huge mcu fan so of course i watched it multiple times it gets worse every time i watch it its boring bland and feels slow in pacing
Nov 23 2020,positive,this is such a fun action film with a positive portrayals of women heroes our family has watched it multiple times  im surprised at the negative reviews this is not like the more typical malefocused hero movies it has lots of callouts to the power of womens camaraderie and strength this is an important movie for girls and women and hopefully more movies like this will follow
Nov 22 2020,negative,huge dud considering the mountain of quality marvel content it was built upon
Nov 21 2020,positive,while the leads performance was dull and stoic i rather enjoyed the color schemes the concept and culture of kree and their ominous supreme intelligence leaderleaders as is missing in many marvel movies id appreciate a more thorough pseudoscientific explanation of how her powers work just what exactly she can do with them besides generic blasts and expulsion force to make her fly i want to know if she ages differently if she needs food if she runs out of energy etc lots of style and little substance beside nostalgia
Nov 21 2020,negative,captain marvel as a story makes very little sense worse it makes even less sense within the mcu why include nick fury if his knowledge of captain marvel makes all his subsequent decisions deranged did the director not watch any of the other movies in the show they were hired to direct    problems with the mcu aside captain marvel makes no sense on its own either  as a super hero origin story there is no real adversity no failure captain marvel can immediately do everthing she needs to when she needs to     and as a story theres so much wrong deus ex machina  also the skree are bad right theyre persecuting the skrull who are more evil because they look evil or something is chasing them into other star systems anyway so when captain marvel gleefully destroys the last skrull ships shes really laughing whilst she kills a bunch of refugees i dunno i dont get this movies story or its message
Nov 19 2020,negative,i unironically forgot about this movie and what happened in it which kind of just reflects the movie in general a forgettable bore i only watched it once cause it was just so blah like you cant get attached to the movie or anyone in the move cause the main character is so blahhhhhhhhhhhhh its kind of like thor but at least chris hemsworth had some charisma basically the plot is cm goes to earth and has memories on earth so she teams up with nick fury to find her memories and things happen the main character and villian are so bland and boring it makes any hope of finding this movie enjoyable interesting or something you can invest yourself in impossible cause your to bored to care
Nov 18 2020,negative, captain marvel may be a safe superhero origin film that provides expected action and humor but regardless its still a satisfying entry in the mcu carried by an effortless star turn from brie larson there is so much set up in this movie with a greater picture coming into the future with the mcu maybe in the future this film will feel more important after we see the set up in action that this entry originates
Nov 17 2020,neutral,it was an ok marvel movie it did not reinvent the film industry it did not push boundaries it just gave us an overpowered character that was meant to be the paragon of modern feminism needless to say it fell flat on its face doing that especially since wonder woman was in the cinema months earlier which is so infuriating to see how the critics praised so much based on feminism alone compare it with alita battle angle a much better movie with a likeable character that also accomplishes to highlight a strong female lead without beating you over your head with it but since disney did captain marvel it automatically needs to be hailed as revolutionary no
Nov 15 2020,positive,the movie was awesome great cgi a great hero and a great story     watch this one for yourself  ignore the review bombers 
Nov 14 2020,positive,not that great yet worth watching
Nov 5 2020,positive,ok what you expect out these marvel movies
Nov 5 2020,positive,im not so tempted to be scathing of captain marvel as some other folks are but that isnt to say im denying it has faults more faults than a lot of the other mcu movies the movie is okay but it isnt much more than that
Nov 5 2020,positive,the visuals are good but that is nothing new considering the standard for mcu movies special effects it is a movie about an overpowered woman who doesnt even remember her own past out of nowhere she goes from a useless girl to a super strong hero really they ruined some elements that could have been great like the skrulls also moments like nick furys eye loss were ruined once again by the comedy touch be serious when you have to please forgettable and boring
Nov 3 2020,positive,it is a good movie if you just want to have fun but if youre a marvel fan this movie has a lot of incoherences
Oct 29 2020,negative,this movie did a shoddy job adapting the source material ruined the villains and turned the heroine to a bland one
Oct 29 2020,negative,worst of the marvel movies ive seen agents of shield episodes with bether scenario than this and this nick fury was just bad clichê and booring
Oct 28 2020,positive,its sad that people have misjudged this film because of the large amount of external conflicts with the actress and such but the film itself is not bad it presents a very fun smooth and interesting plot
Oct 27 2020,positive,brie larson is so very cringe
Oct 27 2020,negative,extremely boring no character development no obstacles to overcomeit just feels as if the main character is going through the story just passing by its just things happening in a secuence about which you dont care at all because there is no emotional attachment development there are no stakesand you never feel any danger or the slightest possibility that the enemies have any chance of winning morover the main character is the most unlikable and arrogant character in the story
Oct 25 2020,negative,found the lack of charisma in the main character to be very distracting
Oct 24 2020,negative,great looking pretty movie downright holy plot that either corrupts or entirely breaks at least three other plot lines across the marvel universe so many things in this movie makes zero sense and its so unlike the rest of marvel comics to just throw a bunch of stuff together that doesnt even line up with itself half an hour earlier in the film the main character ill refer to as a plank due to the literal lack of character doesnt even get an origin story theres no power discovery theres no training montage theres no stumbling falling or getting back up except in flashbacks from before she got her powers for like 3 full seconds with no context whatsoever please watch just dont think about it
Oct 22 2020,negative,its just so very bland
Oct 19 2020,positive,you may like or not like brie but the movie itself is great and fits perfectly into the marvel universe i thought the movie would be crap but now i consider it as one of the best from the franchise
Oct 18 2020,positive,this is not one of the best superhero movies but it is also not one of the worst he is average
Oct 17 2020,negative,i think most importantly this movie did not have any impact on the world mcu history or other important characters its okay if the acting was good but larsons acting was terrible
Oct 13 2020,negative,this movie is a lump of crap weird reality in the movie dumb parts and very stupid conception lump clap of clap crap
Oct 10 2020,negative,should be called captain mary sue
Oct 10 2020,positive,set in a time before the avengers a woman with amnesia is endowed with powers fighting a war when shes captured and taught shes more than she thinks she is 
Oct 7 2020,neutral,as a marvel action summer blockbuster kind of movie it has everything you need but the origin story is so boring and terribly handled and brie larson was a terrible casting
Oct 5 2020,negative,captain marvel is arrogant and irritating for much of the film and they reduced samuel l jacksons character to a pathetic clown who is constantly making jokes and the worst part is the way he loses his eye omg the cgi is very good but it cannot carry the movie alone
Oct 4 2020,negative,please view this movie if you feel there needs to be another wedge put between different societal groups
Sep 30 2020,negative,definitely the worst of marvel first round of movies  people talk about this as being a gender movie and while the most ridiculous part of this girl movie was the im just a girl in the end fight i never had such an eye roll until that moment      the reason this movie failed is that it just wasnt that good larsons acting wasnt great its was akward and stiff jackson again takes the show in this one the only bright point really  story was weak acting was mostly weak
Sep 30 2020,positive,loved itfew more changes and one of the best movies story is kind of irelevant to the fact that captain marvel was technechly the first avengerhelps us to figure out more of the marvel universe
Sep 28 2020,positive,not the most memorable or important marvel movie but the cast is great action is fun and i really dig the 90s vibe and young samuel l jackson
Sep 28 2020,negative,badly written and interesting
Sep 27 2020,negative,very bland story great graphics
Sep 27 2020,negative,horrible story ruins one of the coolest mysteries of a certain mcu character leaves one with nothing to walk away with 
Sep 25 2020,negative,boring generic marvel the cast was barely engaging which hurts when as an audience member youre supposed to care enough to watch them solve the mystery of who captain marvel really is what happened to her memories i will give them credit for not having her fight an exact copy of her abilities only evil a la black panther iron man winter soldier edward nortons hulk venom etc etc etc
Sep 21 2020,negative,samuel jackson saves this movie from being completely unwatchable the story isnt that good it feels like somebody has thrown a group of characters together and hoped for the best the acting is subpar and the jokes if you can call them that did not work
Sep 17 2020,negative,the absolute definitive worst movie ever made in the mcu you literally cannot argue
Sep 13 2020,neutral,the movie fell flat for me they had a chance to make it really great but they disappointed me if it wasnt for samuel l jackson this would have been way worse
Sep 13 2020,positive,its as good or bad as any other marvel film if you like that sort of thing youll like this
Sep 13 2020,negative,action was good story was meh acting was bad beside samuel l jackson he did amazing over all it was average with nothing special ill probably never watch this movie again so i will give it 2 stars
Sep 11 2020,positive,its a perfectly middleoftheroad mcu movie it doesnt actively suck but neither is it actively good its just there
Sep 10 2020,negative,yeah nah overpowered and underwhelming
Sep 6 2020,positive,the supporting cast kept this movie afloat despite brie larson
Sep 4 2020,negative,i though brie did a good performance in the room that it could translate over but her acting felt so dry and boring the whole way
Sep 3 2020,negative,cmon really introduced three villains and made them boring nick fury was just a tool for those wacky funny jokes and carol aww man im disapponted
Sep 1 2020,positive,special effects 10sound effects 10acting 05story 10
Aug 31 2020,positive,love that there is a movie hero for girls to look up to  just wish that they would put more effort and money into movies like this
Aug 30 2020,positive,pretty good interesting very predictable movie starring the wonderful brie larson samuel l jackson and jude law this movie is pretty much what i expected a good fun time with wonky cgi as always and no real answers to infinity war im very surprised by the low people score on rotten tomatoes but i think its because they want answers for infinity war i liked the plot but ronan the accuser is super underused but besides that and jude law being jude law thats all for the negatives i cant wait for the next marvel movie
Aug 30 2020,negative,how has this been green lit for a sequel  garbage
Aug 30 2020,negative,i found the movie boring predictable and kind of whiny
Aug 29 2020,positive,in my opinion the most underrated marvel film ever i actually thought this was a pretty good film i enjoyed it it had some good action scenes
Aug 29 2020,negative,most of the movie felt forced if you can get past storytelling and dynamics then maybe it was a visually good in fact  the money i wasted on this movie would have been better spent on fireworks which are visually better
Aug 28 2020,negative,the first 13 to 34 of the movie was a 910 or maybe better but the moment the power was fully realized and every moment after absolutely destroyed every sense of value and loss that was beautifully woven throughout the early parts of the film
Aug 27 2020,positive,when i started the movie i was thinking the movie wouldnt be good but when i finished i loved it it was the first mavel movie who had a woman as a main character the movie shows how difficult is to be a woman specially in the army and its end with she realizing that she is a great woman she is powerfull and a big heroin
Aug 26 2020,negative,felt hollow and forgettable remove her from avengers endgame and hardly notice i might give it another go but my daughter and i prefer star girl she had a choice of captain america or marvel see wanted captain america and i agree
Aug 26 2020,negative,what a mess    lets hope there isnt a part 2
Aug 25 2020,positive,i loved it and i feel it gave little girls a hero to look up to
Aug 24 2020,positive,great movie i had a really good time with it carol and fury friendship is adorable i really dont understand the hate brie larson fits so well with carol danvers and i cant wait to see what this hero is going to bring next time so excited for the marvels please give us the best sequel ever nia dacosta
Aug 23 2020,negative,captain marvel has the distinct honor of being the first mcu film i did not purchase for my personal collection if this movie and character is supposed to be the flagship that replaces captain america and iron man going forward marvel studios has made a major mistake not even 90s nostalgia won me over nor do i have the most stringent of expectations from your typical marvel movie
Aug 22 2020,negative,this movie is vanilla ice scream with a side of preachy girl power id imagine if i was a 13 year old girl id probably like this or could relate if youre not then its a movie wish i could say more about this but its very formulaic and predictable and safe id use the word boring to better describe this movie i dont hate it as much as some of the other people i know but this is definitely top 5 of the worst marvel movies i wouldnt watch this again and wouldnt recommend
Aug 21 2020,positive,a really fun film that has a lot of 90s stuff in good action good characters easy to watch
Aug 17 2020,negative,if you have insomnia then watch this film i promise it will put you to sleep
Aug 17 2020,negative,ive had too high hopes they pointed out the wrong things terrible story sammy did a good job though
Aug 15 2020,negative,mehit passed the time  glad i didnt pay to see this movie
Aug 15 2020,negative,its trash dont recommend it
Aug 14 2020,negative,if this movie tries to set a good example for children it totally crashes into a wall
Aug 13 2020,positive,anyone waiting for a typical marvel movie will love the movie now anyone who thinks captain marvel will be better than the typical avengers movies will be disappointed positive note for brie larson  great acting
Aug 13 2020,positive,second mcu movie in the timeline where the visuals are superior to those released earlier chronologically while the characters are engaging and it is fun to see continuity holes filled as a movie in its own right it lacks just a little snap and originality
Aug 11 2020,positive,oh not much of a story but it had lots of action and funny
Aug 10 2020,negative,unsatisfying bland on details limited action a lot of chit chat for 2 hours with no storyline
Aug 9 2020,negative,my money my choice
Aug 2 2020,negative,main character is anything else than interesting or sympathic story is not impressing better use your time watch another movie
Aug 1 2020,negative,high quality shit movie very hard to watch very bad action and the main character and just a disgusting story and as usual the whole movie was pulled samuel jackson
Jul 30 2020,negative,i had high hopes maybe thats why i was so disappointed i can follow movies pretty well normally but the writing in this was terrible i dont like brie larson normally but she was ok in this not great not terrible but damn the movie suuucked
Jul 27 2020,positive,this movie was crafted for the girls and the gays if youve only seen it once give it another watch im certain youll enjoy it
Jul 26 2020,negative,shit plot shittier acting lets just say it was a shit movie
Jul 24 2020,neutral,okay what the fuck is up with the misplaced 90s grungerock music its weird to be listening to come as you are while some superhero gets ready to beat the shit out of some alien motherfuckers intentions were noble but i think marvel did their first major femalecentric film dirty its kind of an awful taste but good execution type of thing that happened here i would love to see a femalefronted marvel film that isnt as turgid as wonder womanwhich is actually pretty good in itself but unlike the abovenamed dc film captain marvel was nowhere close to surpassing its malecentric predecessors even antman was more watchable i say this because i hoped to be proven wrong even after making at least four attempts to watch this film before eventually getting to finally finish it in one sitting furthermore i hoped misogynistic knobs were merely exaggerating and being their usual salty hateful selves in every comment section of a given post about this film or alison brie its overall an okay film but its kind of evident how these people are clueless about executing a good femfronted film and give it justice its almost as if its intentional just so people wouldnt ask them to make something like it again
Jul 23 2020,negative,too manipulative  not enough story  not something id ever consider watching again or recommending
Jul 23 2020,positive,so much fun highly recommended
Jul 22 2020,positive,i loved it and it made me feel very empowered as a female and gave me a new woman to look up to in the generally male dominated  marvel universe
Jul 19 2020,neutral,in the end i watch these marvel films because they are great pieces of entertainment and this one might actually be the most boring out of them all  there are some good sequences here and there especially with nick fury but i never got behind the lead performance and the movie felt a little bland for my liking
Jul 18 2020,positive,captain marvel was actually not bad i honestly thought this was better than wonder woman 1984 i feel like an outsider for saying this but i thought that brie larson was a great pick for this role there were a few scenes that didnt work and a few boring moments but the movie does go fast enough for it not to be as boring which i think might be the one problem with this movie this movie is actually too short i think this movie needs to be at least 2hrs 14min just so that we can be in carols world more i feel like there are a lot of interesting things that happen in her past but we dont get enough time to explore that i would like to know more on what happens between her and maria rambeau and more on her connections with monica rambeau the movie unfortunately doesnt do that as much as i would like it to and focuses more on the kree the kree and skrull stuff is fine and can be entertaining and we do need an introduction to the kree skrull war but honestly i just found carols past with maria and her journey through the air force more interesting but all in all it still was a fun ride despite its issues and also the way they handle stan lee after his resent passing at the time was done beautifully and thats something that i cant ignore on what the film did for the closing for the mcu infinity saga this movie is not as bad has the haters want you to think sure it might be a weak mcu movie but as a movie on its own its still enjoyable believe it or not a lot of people were warming up to captain marvel in avengers endgame so maybe captain marvel ii now called the marvels will be the winter soldier of the captain marvel franchise i think the franchise just needs a new direction and i think a lot of people will start to warm up to brie when a new director takes in for the franchise and since nia dacosta is directing the sequel i think the franchise might be heading for an interesting good start all in all its an alright movie 810
Jul 18 2020,negative,firstly the main character is flat the plot holes are abundant and obvious why do you need a light speed engine when you can jump through worm holes secondly why are the scroll good guys picture a film where the scroll slowly infiltrate the upper echelons of the government only to have nick fury become aware of this somehow his worst nightmares confirmed by captain marvel who has been pursuing the scroll they are forced to team up and save the planet instead of randomly meeting at a bar it would of been invasion of the body snatchers meets a superhero movie how cool would of that been instead we get a convoluted plot with no tension please get better writers next time
Jul 17 2020,negative,waste of time the worst movie in the marvel series 
Jul 16 2020,negative,the special effects are terrific like all the other marvel super hero movies  lots of action that said i didnt find the lead character at all interesting or charismatic   i have to say that of all the marvel movies this is the only one i wont buy  or even care to see again  it just doesnt win you over  the lead character has very little depth passion substance or appeal  richard brody of the new yorker wrote the best review  the film is an exercise in platitudes  the overall message is tired and completely unnecessary  personally i think its great that the powers at marvel made captain marvel female hes a male in the original comics but why blond and caucasian  marvel needs an asian super hero  that wouldve opened many new doors and been a lot more interesting   truth be told wonder woman totally smokes captain marvel  captain marvel  even with all the action and millions and millions of dollars behind her  is pretty much a big over blown dud
Jul 15 2020,positive,great  fun with good humor  quick dialogue
Jul 15 2020,negative,this is the worst thing marvel has ever created
Jul 14 2020,positive,captain robert in may was the best film ever once on the cinema best acting best storyline ever load of action for the family and many marvel fans i dont understand why the viewers at home dave its phil popcorn horses one the most highly rated marvel superhero female superhero films ever i am right in the five stars because i think its one the best best best and take your captain mum herself its such a really good film the whole family and the very best i understand a lot people wont understand this but i find it highly rated on the best films of the time captain robert in may was the best film ever once on the cinema best acting best story line ever laura action for the family and many marvel fans i dont understand why the viewers at home dave its built popcorn horse is one the most highly rated marvel superhero female superhero films ever i am writing to 5 stars because i think its one the best best best and take your captain mum herself its such a really good film the whole family and the very best i understand a lot people wont understand this but i find it highly rated on the best films of the time
Jul 13 2020,positive,this movie is underrated its definitely not one of the best mcu movies but it has some funny humor and memorable action sequences its worth seeing
Jul 13 2020,negative,awful movie and awful acting watching this was a horrible experience
Jul 11 2020,positive,brie larson is great and theres a ton of sammy l whats not to like
Jul 11 2020,negative,the plot is predictable and poor storytelling
Jul 9 2020,positive,captain marvel is a poorly rated movie by the public which is something i dont understand why captain marvel is one of the best mcu films the story the action scenes are very good academy awardwinning brie larson plays a character charismatic and extremely strong the films weakest point is the villain made by jude law where it is poorly exploited and acted upon
Jul 8 2020,positive,the movie was incredible but longish    longish is the only problem i had with the movie
Jul 8 2020,negative,does it get any worseby far the worst of the super hero movies if brie wasnt easy to look at i would have cut it off half way through
Jul 7 2020,neutral,mostly i like what i have seen from the mcu so far i was hoping for more of the same here but am not sure where to put the blame brie larson is  a fine actor but she isnt given much depth is that the fault of the writers the constraints they were working under or the directors hard to say but larsons basic role here is  strutting thrusting her jaw out and squaring her shoulders oh and to squint like she  wants everyone around her know that she knows a secret that they dont    its like going to a restaurant the mcu you like but  get served a dish without a lot of flavor more spices next time please
Jul 6 2020,positive,a really good superhero movie some beautiful and badass moments solid entry in the mcu overselling the 90s thing a little though ie not everyone in 1995 was listening to current music for the time
Jul 5 2020,negative,gives a certain warning bells for the audience just forgetable but good for pass time
Jul 5 2020,negative,while this movie did have okay action and pretty good visual effects the writing of this movie couldve been so much better i really hope they can improve captain marvels storyline in her next movie but in this one she falls flat
Jul 4 2020,negative,i really wish they had made a movie about scarlet witch or black widow instead this movie was aggressively disappointing and captain marvel herself was aggressively unlikeable in the movie starts pretty promising but fizzles out to almost nothing by the end it was good to see phil again though
Jul 3 2020,negative,the worst marvel movie as of date
Jul 3 2020,positive,was expecting so much more it wasnt bad but definitely not what i es expecting 
Jul 2 2020,positive,loved the movie and the acting entertaining and a great addition to the marvel universe
Jul 1 2020,negative,absolute garbage an insult to the marvel brand
Jun 30 2020,positive,not quite sure why this was so unpopular with the audience
Jun 28 2020,negative,it sucks so bad that it makes me feel   disgusted
Jun 28 2020,positive,so how was my very first experience on disney plus    shit they have some kinks to work out    the first half of the movie i watched on my smartphone and it was so dark i thought i was watching manos hands of fate i eventually switched over to my pc and it became the whisper show so im trying to forgive the movie for the platforms technical difficulties    i have to do this in 2 parts    as a movie to its own right its extremely well produced it has an interesting plot characters hooks and twists that would normally wow audiences    it is clearly designed to only be watched on a big theatre screen though with the choice of darkness and sound there are parts of this that mechanically designed to be emphasized on the big screen that dont translate to a living room    as it relates to the other franchise movies its fine other than they used it to rewrite the origins of shield and the avengers causing continuity breaks further than already exist    now as a marvel movie this is definitely the worst one we finally get a strong female lead in her own movie and the literally just mix the most current version with whatever pieces they want from the comics they even changed mar vell to a woman and then buried her as a refugee scientist    this seems to be done to mislead the audience as jude law was thought to be playing mar vell the point of this is to keep this fresh for people that already know the story elementsbut thats why we want to watch the movie because we know enough of the story elements that were interested just on the name the people that have no idea who captain marvel is dont care its not a twist for them marvel studios just doesnt understand the concept that these movies are popular because the comics were popular and the rest of the noncomic fans dont have a point of reference    not only do we never get ms marvel who captain mar vell a kree hero of terra gave his powers to with his dying breath with the addition of fox studios to disney we cant have rogue because she got her strength and flight from ms marvel by putting her in a coma but we have binary under a different name which has the superman problem of being boring because shes that powerful    ultimately a decent movie i even like it but it has a world of universe continuity problems in an already broken universe    please watch its worth your time to form your own opinion i doubt anyone will really hate this movie
Jun 28 2020,positive,the most underrated marvel film ever i actually thought this film was pretty good i enjoyed it it had some good action scenes
Jun 27 2020,negative,captain marvel is pretty hard to watch carol is an asshole with no redeeming qualities that never has to learn from her mistakes or go through any conflict that cant be solved by punching it nick furys character is assassinated he is no longer a cold and calculating spy he is a happygolucky cop and the mystery of what happened in his past is boring and retcons his character the skrulls are boring and are there because we need to subvert expectations captain marvel doesnt do that on her own jude laws character was there so brie larson could tell the mean man to go away if you want the general audience to like your character write them like one everyone liked spiderverse because of this reason
Jun 26 2020,negative,captain marvel has misfired in several directionthe action scenes are disappointing the acting is bad maybe except samuel jackson the casting is badbrie larson does not suit for captain marvel the direction is good but the problem is with the scriptthin dialogues and forced humor  the villains are weak and bad the skrulls are just uselessthis is the worst marvel movie ever
Jun 24 2020,negative,really weak if compare whith the others mcu movies its obviously the worst among them
Jun 24 2020,positive,amazing movie hope the squeal lives up to it
Jun 24 2020,negative,i didnt like this movie theres nothing more too it this opinion of mine has nothing to do with any rude comments that the actress made before or about this being the first female led mcu movie i just didnt like the character of captain marvel much she had no standout personality no character development no mistakes to learn from nothing that made the character compelling or made me care about her she only ever seems to have an emotional part of mind except for maybe a minute in one scene and thats it she never has a defining moment to show us who she is without her powers its those moments that tells us who the hero really is and what makes them a hero its a major part of any superheros character with steve rogers the scene in the alley shows us everything we need to know about him and we continue to see the same kid in the alley that stood up to the bully saying i can do this all day throughout the entire franchise for tony stark we see plenty of him outside his suit and why he does what he does in every movie for thor there are plenty of scenes like the sacrifice in thor 1 the odin scene in ragnarok and of course the thorrocket scene in infinity war for captain marvel theres nothing the closest we get to something is when her friend gives a really well executed speech about who she is but the problem is were hearing it from someone else instead of seeing anything show not tell captain marvel has no arc in the story is very condescending and makes for a very boring lead character the villains are boring as well yon rogg is a generic boring villain and we never really feel like there is a legitimate relationship between him and captain marvel for there to be any weight to their fight the supreme intelligence is even worse this is a useless meaningless bland villain that doesnt even have enough that stands out to even be considered a character we know absolutely nothing about it the standouts of the movie are samuel l jackson as a younger less cynical nick fury and the skrulls although there was only one thing i absolutely hated about it the scene where nick fury loses his eye is terrible in captain america the winter soldier fury said last time i trusted someone i lost an eye this implied that his losing an eye was a pretty major thing and contributed to his character and why he didnt trust people it couldve been a pretty cool moment that they told us at some point down the line but they decided to take out his eye in the most ridiculous way possible he lost his eye just because he messed with an alien cat and it scratched his eye this scene felt like it was just played for laughs this movie may have made a billion dollars but that doesnt mean it was on its own merits the main reason this made so much money was because many people felt they need to watch it in order to understand avengers endgame at this point everyone was looking forward to the next mcu movie and many people including me thought it would be great unfortunately it wasnt this was a pretty huge disappointment
Jun 23 2020,negative,i thought captain marvel was the weakest of the marvel movie franchise so far i have no desire or intention of ever watching this film again there was nothing at stake for captain marvel she had no strong adversaries and therefore no character arc brie larsons acting was uninspiring at best all in all a waste of my time and money go watch captain america the winter soldier a much better movie
Jun 22 2020,positive,the interesting backstory is the best part of this otherwise bogstandard marvel outing the plot twist was telegraphed instantly by the english accent and wheres the tension when you have a superhero who can stop ballistic missiles in their tracks
Jun 22 2020,negative,not real just trying to please everyone
Jun 21 2020,positive,following the infamous marvel formula almost step by step captain marvel fulfills his goals in showing an imposing heroine without falling into stereotypes of female strength even if at times they have a confusing and predictable narrative
Jun 21 2020,positive,took me a while to get to this heard  a lot of bad things but the movie was ok not one of marvels best but i had had fun watching it glad i seen it on streaming and did not pay theater prices for sure but it was not bad   the good brie larsen captain marvel she was a little wooden but was the only character i cared about   good cinematography and fx   bad bad guy is comically weak stupid and inept i could beat him with no powers that always lessens the victory for the most powered up hero   bad samuel jacksons worst outing making a guy talk and whine in high pitched mickey mouse voice while being inept is not funny its annoying
Jun 20 2020,neutral,without the absolute delight that is samuel l jackson as a young nick fury captain marvel is an otherwise pretty dull movie
Jun 19 2020,negative,if i could give it a zero star i would godawful from start to finish i wont buy it or ever see it again marveldisney you better stop fucking up these franchises
Jun 19 2020,positive,a recent storyline from 2018 in the life of captain marvel actually establish a brand new twist on the characters origins making her the daughter of a female kree warrior and a human in a plot very reminiscent of aquamans origin story right down to the lighthouse keeper finding a stranded alien woman having part of her power and legacy coming from her own mother and not specifically from the accident with marvell helps to ground the feminist narrative a bit more strongly there are also some interesting elements through her history from a bout with alcoholism her impulsiveness and her amnesia that in the words of author gerry conway helps to set a parallel between her quest for identity and the modern womans quest for raised consciousnessfor selfliberation for identity in a way thats intentional ms marvel because of her name if nothing else is influenced to a great extent by the move towards womens liberation she is not a marvel girl shes a woman not a miss or a mrs a ms her own person herself      there is definitely a strong presence of that theme in anna boden and ryan flecks film where brie larsons kree warrior vers struggle with memories of a past she is unfamiliar with and is on a quest to discover who she really is a journey that may just help her tap into an unexpected power she possess the feminist subtext couldnt be any clearer the characters amnesia which is never portrayed as being debilitating is an engrossing engine that keeps the film going and gives it a lot of heart the story by the directorial team and geneva robertsondworet does also carry a bit of political subtext that feels especially relevant these days even though it cant keep all of its plot twists from being guessed way ahead of time but it does contain a few good ones that may surprise longtime comic book readers    the 90s settings is a fun way to exploit fully the ghosting technology that mapped younger versions of kurt russell michael douglas or robert downey jrs faces on their bodies in earlier installments of the mcu filmography giving us a rather convincing thirtysomething samuel jackson as well as a twentysomething clark cregg reprising his role as youthful and not quite as worldweary agent nick fury the technology which also helped resurrect peter cushing for rogue one a star wars story has never been used so extensively before and open doors to not only actors being able to be younger for a whole film would solo a star wars story known a better fate if harrison ford would have played himself as a younger man but also for performers to be allegedly able to use body doubles when they have previous engagement     samuel l jackson and brie larson share great chemistry trading banter all through the film and making one wish for a reunion that may or may not happen in the upcoming avengers endgame the supporting cast is equally strong including an emotional portrayal by lashana lynch as maria rambeau the aforementioned monica rameaus mother and carole danvers best friend it has to be noted that there is no love interest in captain marvel carol danvers doesnt need to be defined by her relationship to a man her closest bond is in fact with her best friend maria rambeau her fellow fighter pilot who tells her in a touching moment you were the most powerful woman i knew right before you could shoot fire from your fists as for the rest of the stellar cast jude law is serviceable as vers mentor yonrogg and both ben mendelsohn as the skrull leader talos and annette bening in a surprising dual role seem to have a lot of fun with their characters     speaking of the skrulls as a comic book fan i have to admit i was overjoyed by the inclusion of one of the most ancient alien race in the marvel intergalactic stable and how close to their original design they were the film goes in some interesting directions with the shapeshifting alien race but one feels that their full potential have yet to be realized and could the fantastic four be far away now that one of their earliest foes have now entered the marvel universe we know that they have now reverted ownership to disney from fox and a reboot is most likely imminent    captain marvel is a worthy addition to the mcu menagerie of heroes and will provide some much needed muscles in their upcoming conflicts as well as opening up further the space frontier that was conquered by the guardians of the galaxy it may be marvels first film featuring a female superhero as its main star it may not be able to benefit from the cultural impact wonder woman had as a feminist benchmark in blockbuster superhero filmmaking having come second in that particular game even though it did awaken hordes of insecure incels threatened by brie larsons statements about the lack of diversity at press junkets and her refusal to applaud when accused sexual harasser casey affleck took the stage at the 2017 oscars it could also be the fear of losing the hegemony of male dominated blockbusters but lets face it this is one monopoly that is in no danger of going away films like wonder woman and captain marvel or female leads like rey and jyn erso in the recent star wars movies are important role models for young women and girls who can look up to something else than princesses and bratz and not only little girls i remember seeing a young boy miming using a bow and arrow coming out of the theater showing wonder woman evoking the fierce amazon warriors from themiscyra     im kind of done with you telling me what i cant do carole danvers says at one point in the film which is already raking in hundreds of millions the message to insecure males couldnt be clearer    just smile guys you look so much nicer when you smile      ps the film deserves extra credits for the lovely tribute to captain marvel cocreator stan lee at the very beginning which made this comic book fan a bit choked up and his obligatory cameo will make one kevin smith very happy
Jun 18 2020,positive,funny and great action actors are good
Jun 17 2020,positive,really good you get to see a powerful woman learning about herself and her powers plus bonus point stan lee smiles at captain marvel he hardly ever interacts with a marvel character well except tony  war machine haha  cant wait to see captain marvel 2 go brie larson
Jun 17 2020,neutral,average mcu movie nothing special unless you like a woman superhero because this is the first movie ever that has a woman lead
Jun 16 2020,neutral,it was ok decently entertaining jude law was definitely the best talent here but underutilised gemma chan as minerva as well brie larson was a little bland and plot dynamics was so so and ended with a pffft  would i watch this yes after all i watched twilight knowing it was bad and plan 9 from outer space ed wood
Jun 16 2020,positive,slow but interesting story buildup though it is not as actionpacked as wonder woman this has more drama and character build up rather than painfully teasing about the lovelife of captain marvel it would have been better and more respectful and powerful if she was was brought out as a lesbian at least during the post credits in the extended edition so that it may be cutoff of politicalcommercial reasons in places where they make a big deal
Jun 15 2020,positive,the movies itself was ok and i definitely enjoyed some of it but they wrote themselves into a corner concerning captain marvel  they gave her all her powers and character development in a very short period of time leaving her with no room to grow if they want to use her in later movies  they definitely dont have the humans actually reacting to the fact that aliens exist which is kind of odd to me but mostly a nitpick  the movie can get a little bland a some points but it also has some good scenes  overall the movie isnt a bad movie but it isnt a great movie
Jun 14 2020,negative,character tried to talk their way through the universe little action bored throughout most of film 
Jun 14 2020,negative,i have never been more bored by a marvel movie some of me wishes that this whole thing was a joke and the entire movie was just an mp4 of fred the movie cuz at least he has a character
Jun 14 2020,negative,im not really sorry to say this because its true but captain marvel is a bland character    and this movie is a stain for this series of films and brings the marvel universe down this movie is trash please kill it
Jun 13 2020,negative,i feel brie larson is not powerful in this movie
Jun 13 2020,negative,very disappointing my cat acts better than larson
Jun 12 2020,negative,i dont know why critics gave this movie high ratings
Jun 11 2020,negative,movie has little in terms of character development trying to flash out the character using memories didnt work at all as soon as the movie begins she already has all the powers so any tension that could be build from that is gone theres no worthy enemies as well in the end you simply dont care about her
Jun 11 2020,negative,its a very boring movie
Jun 11 2020,negative,lead had the depth of worn out graphene
Jun 11 2020,negative,captain marvel lacks personality and the story is boring and also the villains are jokes
Jun 9 2020,negative,i am a woman and i thought this movie was very very meh this movie did nothing for me i love strong women like buffy and leia in movies but stop making these movies disney with women who are mary sues lazy writing hidden behind decent cgi i really am disappointed in hollywood nowadays
Jun 4 2020,positive,i was surprised bout the quality of this movie it is fun to see nick fury in a different version he was entertaining i liked captain marvel too her backstory is not the most original exciting or interesting the 90s feeling was present and fresh the villain was pretty predictable i dont really know if the chip was a good idea the chip makes her weaker it doesnt allow her to become as powerful or to reach her full potential that felt like lazy writing overall still fun
Jun 4 2020,negative,this movie made me almost sleep the story and pacing is a mess i think they miscast captain marvel
Jun 4 2020,negative,emotionless piece of crap
Jun 3 2020,positive,i didnt know what to expect when i watched this movie i dont know much about captain marvel to know what im getting myself into but after seeing it i didnt hate this movie but i didnt love this movie either i thought brie larson was fine but early on there was a line in maybe the first 5 minutes of the movie where they kinda tipped their hand and everything was revealed to me but then i watched it again and i couldnt find the line so i dont really know how i figured the plot out maybe that line is there i dont know but this movie is fine its not good but its not bad i was kinda afraid that captain marvel would be super overpowered and she kinda is but this movie has its moments but its not as good as it could be
Jun 3 2020,negative,boring dull and stale
Jun 3 2020,negative,extremely boring unrealistic over the top illogical
Jun 2 2020,positive,brie larson samuel l jackson and the ever undertheradar but always working ben mendelsohn team up in this betterthanaverage superhero turn meant primarily to introduce a lead female role in the marvel universe diversifying the same where there previously was a lack the story is decent the point of feminine inclusion well hidden by good writing and sparkly cgi ably imparts a welcoming glow for ladies watching not previously interested in the whole predictable good guybad guy face off  usually necessary for the genre allinall a worthy effort annette bening and lashana lynch round out the cast nicely
Jun 2 2020,positive,better than captain america winter soldier a
Jun 1 2020,negative,this movie was clearly only created by marvel after the backlash they faced for not casting or believing in female led movies the story line was not riveting however brie larsons dedication to the role was its only saving grace
Jun 1 2020,positive,its only human to get back up  captain marvel is one of the most relatable movies in the whole mcu for me and brie larsons captain marvel may have cosmic level powers yet it felt so human because of carol danvers i have been bullied in my life and people tell me you cant do this or that so this movie really felt close to my heart everyone has to face challenges in their lifetime and yet we always get back up or atleast we try our best and thats what makes captain marvels character development so inspiring is that by the end of the movie she doesnt give a shit about what other people tell her to do or not to do because she doesnt have anything to prove to others just like we really dont need to prove anything to others we just need to prove our ability for ourselves and thats what makes us human
May 31 2020,negative,weak plot this was a less impressive cookie cutter version of the other marvel films being that this was the only marvel film to date among the other 30 thousand films theyve made to feature a female lead i was hoping for something more original and pertinent to the heroines journey no such luck take it or leave
May 30 2020,positive,it is nowhere near as powerful as wonder woman and its story is a bit muddled however brie larson is a great choice for  carol danvers and there are enough surprises and strong action scenes to make it at worst a mid level mcu flick
May 30 2020,positive,it started the tour of marvel
May 28 2020,negative,a bland and boring movie makes captain marvel one of the worst mcu movies
May 28 2020,negative,78 you say not in my book and let me just say i dont hate this movie because the main lead is a woman that would be stupid i hate it because i think it had potential that it didnt use were going back in time before the avengers seeing how all of it started nick fury as a younger man and another superhero and yet it misses its mark it tends to use the same joke just a little too much remember this from the 90s the action is not wellchoreographed at all just look at the fight on the bus it cuts in the wrong places it feels tired and seems to go by too quickly and the second worse thing is our lead ms marvel im not calling her the other thing i dont what the director or the actress was thinking but carol danvers is as bland as a piece of cardboard she speaks with the same tone in almost every scene doesnt say anything that makes me care and doesnt seem like a good role model then theres a twist in this movie with the villains that is so generic i almost clocked out and finally the worst thing this movies answers why nick fury has a scarred eye it is an insult to his character but at least he got to drop an fbomb right get out while you still can this movie sucks
May 27 2020,negative,terrible movie even with the lockdown this was a waste of my time
May 27 2020,positive,its the same as the usual mcu so theres no particular surprise  the film was advertised at the time as the story of the beginning of the avengers but the only scene that connects to the avengers is the final part  even if you dont watch it it doesnt interfere with the end game    its so unrelated to the avengers that i dont even think this film is necessary for mcu  he didnt play much in the end game either    if its a oneoff film its entertaining but if you see it as a crossover film its subtle
May 26 2020,positive,the effects were out of this world and the cast put up a pretty good performance
May 25 2020,positive,it was an ok start to captain marvels story not very rewatchable but it sets up her character very nicely and i think the character has potential to be successful and i cant wait to see what they do with it
May 25 2020,negative,another disappointing marvel movie the title character came off too smug and i didnt feel any connection to anything first and only viewing  5112020
May 25 2020,negative,i thought it was cheesy a wanna be version of cpt america all i can say as far as female super heroes go cpt marvel will never be as good as wonder woman and super girl
May 24 2020,negative,didnt care for this film very much no hurdles for main character story not that interesting drama was forced to be fair im not the target audience
May 24 2020,positive,i was surprised at how good this movie was after all of the hate it got
May 23 2020,positive,dont understand the poor reviews because i really enjoyed this movie fully
May 22 2020,negative,pure garbage whoever made this should be ashamed
May 21 2020,negative,i found the movie lacking i wish the gave captain mavel a multidimensional personality my lest favourite mavel movie
May 21 2020,neutral,one of the weaker entries in the mcu for sure brie larson is a talented actress but i wasnt loving her in this she seemed pessimistic and unlikable as the lead but ben mendelsohn and sam jackson are likable in their roles just very forgettable
May 20 2020,negative,boring wooden bland just a bad movie
May 19 2020,negative,sucked would have rather have rewatched incredible hulk again
May 18 2020,positive,i actually like this marvel movie the characters werent all arrogant jerks
May 17 2020,negative,the worst marvel u ever
May 17 2020,positive,nothing different from it colleagues it highlights some points such as its cast and narrative but it keeps us in the same thread of all the superhero movies
May 13 2020,neutral,weakest of the marvel cinematic entries to date seemingly more interested in creating an mcu version of wonder woman than providing the kind of powerful yet empathetic character arc for which the studio has become famous instead it wallows at times in tedium the action is there the engagement is not
May 12 2020,negative,horrible waste of time
May 12 2020,neutral,a movie takes a lot of time to be made and distributed if it had been part of phase 1 or phase 2 mcu movie a 4 star was applicable but because it released in the middle of 2 major avengers movie it seemed a filler than a main course meal with the standard marvel superhero origin
May 11 2020,neutral,this movie is missing a lot of the marvel charm in my opinion it has a beginning middle end as well as a protagonist and several antagonists things are on screen and actions are happening but theres no real pay off for any of it thor 2 used to be my least favorite of the mcu lineup and i think this one has supplanted that thor 2 was lacking in story and also had bad villains but had more fun with itself and tom hiddleston and chris hemsworth it didnt leave me bored as much as slightly unsatisfied i was so bored at the end of captain marvel which bums me out to say because i was talking this movie up for about 2 years when i heard it was being made i think the sequel will be better i believe this one was rushed to beat endgame to the theaters and it feels like it
May 8 2020,negative,waste of timeempty shell great miscast
May 8 2020,negative,bored bored bored what happen with this movie its not necesary
May 7 2020,negative,did not like this one the first time i seen it tried watching it again and still not feeling it cant help but laugh at the actress playing the lead the movie gives off green lantern vibes
May 6 2020,negative,pure trash insulting to the entire mcu
May 4 2020,negative,cool effects but man this movie was hard to seat down to watch i tried to like it but i didnt see nothing in this movie made me like the protagonist or feel sorry for her and always domy research from comics after seeing the movie and man did they mess up some things for future movies and big events down the line with avengers due to taking liberties of changes chara ter completely
Apr 28 2020,positive,brie larson is utterly engaging to me and i would have liked this movie even if it were not made as well as it was  but it was made really well in my opinion  the effects seemed particularly creative and unique  the whole movie just seemed special  
Apr 27 2020,negative,a marvel film shouldnt ever feel like a chore to watch and unfortunately this bland reskin of every other introductoryhero film in the mcu is most certainly the most uninspired of the lot doubled by one distractingly tone deaf performance by brie larson captain marvel is not an awful film its just not a very good film whatsoever
Apr 26 2020,negative,terrible movie terrible acting brie larson and this flaming turd as a whole are all razzie worthy
Apr 26 2020,positive,i liked it a lot i rewatch it occasionally haters gonna hate i like it just enjoy the entertainment
Apr 25 2020,negative,too formulaic without any originality didnt love brie larsons performance humor didnt hit seemed arrogant
Apr 24 2020,negative,this movie is bad like iron man 2 bad comparing the two almost makes iron man 2 look good i might even give iron man 2 a slight edge because its aged poorly while captain marvel is just bad captain marvel is cocky in an annoying way shes boring and the acting in the movie is just annoying and over the top not to mention the plot has more holes than swiss cheese how could marvel take such an interesting character and make such a horrific film especially after producing better movies with less interesting characters like antman id rather watch a solo hawkeye film than this
Apr 24 2020,positive,this movie was not half bad it had a good storyline and gave us a young nick fury brie larsons acting was fine though i must say that there was too much that they changed carol danvers is originally ms marvel and later changes the name to captain marvel after marvell who was a male kree who accepted humans and their planet his alias was walter lawson though this was a very interesting way to retell the story of carol and overall i actually did like it
Apr 23 2020,negative,weak plot a poorly written main character and the plot it self is complitly boring  for me the weakest entry in the mcu
Apr 22 2020,positive,fantastic and fairly accurate for the marvel comics dont judge it by its lack of other heroes its its own story and its an origin story you wont know the characters other than fury and that shouldnt be a problem if youre really a fan of marvel cinema those of you rating it lower cant be judging it by its own standards but by comparisons to your favorites and thats not a good judgement its like saying a new hope is bad compared to episodes 5  6 its the start its not meant to be the end its not meant to have the complex character building its the beginning of a story that hasnt ended yet
Apr 21 2020,negative,i think this movie was very bland captain marvel faced no real problem she is to over powered
Apr 20 2020,positive,solid marvel movie does not deserve the audience score its getting honestly to everyone saying that brie larson was bad  she was comparable to gal gadot as wonder women which is fine
Apr 20 2020,positive,i love the moviei think its my one of the favorite movie of mcu
Apr 19 2020,negative,we shouldve had a black widow trilogy than this it truly ruined the mcu continuity brie larson as carol danvers wasnt that good her story arc wasnt that great they made the skrulls good nick fury lost his eye because of a cat are you kidding me
Apr 18 2020,negative,the 90s flare dont work like the 80s and the story is just abc
Apr 18 2020,positive,despite a low audience score you know not very many people liking it i still found captain marvel pretty enjoyable i just think that this should really have an audience score of 70 or higher i recommend it
Apr 18 2020,positive,i think its the best female marvel superhero movie i ever saw i havent seen a damn good female superhero movie since wonder woman soon im going to review it on youtube under the name multivoice reviewer
Apr 18 2020,positive,this was a great film stupid sexist bullshit played way too great a role in determining audience scores
Apr 18 2020,negative,captain marvel is the 21st film in the marvel cinematic universe its the story of carol danvers an air force pilot who gets powers and becomes one of the strongest heroes in the marvel universe     i have been pretty hyped since i heard that this was the next marvel film and that captain marvel would usher in the new phase of the mcu also with the controversy surrounding the movie i was hoping that the movie would exceed expectations and silence angry misogynistic fanboys i even got a copy of carol danvers first comic book appearance     the movie was entertaining but gets confused in tone its struggles juggling being a pure action movie a 90s nostalgia film and its girl power narrative all these themes were good but the directors dont balance them well     brie lawsons acting was wooden at times but i attributed it to the idea that shes playing a space warrior that doesnt realize shes human but overall shes fine i dont think its her fault because brie is super talented shes won an oscar for her acting ability i think the directors hindered her performance    the chemistry between her and sam jackson was great i think this is their third movie together so they have collaborated in the past and bounce off each other well the samuel l jackson deaging technology is amazing flawless     if you are a fan of kevin smith films you will appreciate the stan lee cameo   overall i did enjoy it this movie exists to introduce captain marvel and to connect to other films the mcu not the strongest contender in the mcu but an entertaining movie
Apr 18 2020,negative,this was a frustrating movie at best it literally boils down to the last 15 minutes or so im a huge superhero fan especially marvel i found wonder woman to be so surprisingly good with a strong lead while this lead in cm was so misplaced and sterile she delivered her lines as if mumbling at times and had little affect even sam jackson was boring and wooden an absolute misfire for marvel 
Apr 17 2020,positive,it would be an honor to be spank by brie larson
Apr 14 2020,positive,im not really into comic book movies but enjoyed captain marvel more than most mcu movies ive watched    lots of humour mostly great sfx but the twist was too predictable literally the first 5 minutes gave it away
Apr 14 2020,negative,i waited until i could stream this film as the deluge of bad online reviews made me not want to see it in the cinema when i finally watched it it want as bad as i had thought it would be there was the potential for a good story in there but marvel wildly overpowered the titular character meaning that it never felt like there were any stakes in her conflicts the big twist kind of worked but once you know it there is zero rewatchability comfortably the worst movie in the franchise
Apr 13 2020,positive,i loved this movie it was so nice to see a female lead that was not a typical hot damsel discovering her strength ww and sexy femme fatale bw sad some critics are judging this movie based on out of context commentary by the lead actressthis is not mcus best film its just an origin story meant to bridge characters and stories that we loved since its conception this movie is fun nostalgic and engaging
Apr 13 2020,neutral,its about as bland as movies get but i also cant call it bad
Apr 11 2020,negative,it was pretty boring and i found captain marvel to be pretty unlikeable  she was not heroicjust cocky and arrogant  it made it hard for me to root for her
Apr 11 2020,negative,terribly written like a cheap soap opera
Apr 10 2020,negative,i really enjoy brie larson as an actress but this movie was poorly put together a lot of the plot made no sense i know its a superhero movie and the cgi looked subpar to other mcu films aside from the back and forth banter between larson and jackson captain marvel doesnt offer much
Apr 9 2020,negative,the combination of weak character development a story as dull as dishwater and the constant preaching about how bad men are was too much for me
Apr 9 2020,negative,the main hero is overpowered shes god lost opportunity
Apr 9 2020,negative,this movie blows the acting was wooden the special effects were sub par it looked like a syfy channel movie actually id take sharknado over this 
Apr 8 2020,negative,boring like watching paint dry
Apr 8 2020,negative,this movie sucks it is not a good movie
Apr 8 2020,positive,its really good i love bree larson and samuel l jackson in it its funny at the right time and the action gets me pumped but thats a marvel movie for you action packed and just pure fun
Apr 8 2020,positive,marvels first femalecentric film did not disappoint brie larson as the title role stands as a formidable character who i am excited to see in future marvel films with a great soundtrack this film carried humor action and a lot of power while the protagonist is pretty flat she is a step in the right direction unsure of why this film is getting so much hate i felt empowered throughout nearly the entire movie would absolutely recommend
Apr 4 2020,negative,awful as expected larson just doesnt have screen presence for this role she looks bored throughout the movie just as i was while watching this
Apr 3 2020,positive,i know not everyone likes this movie but this is one of my favorite marvel movies sooo fun
Mar 29 2020,positive,definitely my least favorite mcu movie and yes that includes thor 2 was some what boring however i did enjoy jude laws roll and the introduction of the skrulls
Mar 29 2020,positive,much better than i expected and was lead to believe by all the negative opinions well worth inclusion in the marvel universe
Mar 28 2020,negative,this movie was strait dumpster juice especially the explanation of how fury got his eye messed up 
Mar 28 2020,negative,ohhhh boy where to start with this one actually i dont think i will even do it the service of starting to begin with
Mar 27 2020,negative,sorry but this is not a good movie
Mar 26 2020,positive,it was okay it had decent action scenes definitely not marvels best but worth a watch at least once
Mar 26 2020,positive,love it more every time i watch it its one of my new favorites from marvel
Mar 26 2020,positive,i loved this movie so much this was an epic preendgame film but also an epic film on its own this movie was a treat for the people who have seen all mcu films to date and this movie gives a taste as to what might come next in the mcu universe postendgame brie larson samuel l jackson ben mendelsohn lashana lynch and clark gregg are the standouts of the film
Mar 23 2020,negative,i know im going to get a lot of hate for this but i personally didnt like brie larsons portrayal of captain marvel she seemed arrogant overpowered and didnt have any sense of weakness compared to the other heroes that came before her alas black widow scarlett witch gamora etcetera captain marvel is a lessthan mediocre origin film that suffers from a weak script an uninspired performance by the main lead and a plot that ruins some of the lore in the marvel cinematic universe brie larson is a great actress she just needs a better script and a stronger character to show it
Mar 23 2020,positive,packed with action humor and visual thrills captain marvel introduces the mcus latest hero with an origin story that makes effective use of the franchises signature formula
Mar 21 2020,positive,i think movie was solid but my reason for loving this movie is because of brie larsons story in the dramaarts industry  after learning that brie larson was also started in one of the worst movie adaptations of a novel hoot she got back on her feet and kept working hard to get better and better roles i watched her role in room and realized shes worked for better roles and honed her acting skills to be the face of major mcu character she may be young but its important to give younger people a chance to prove themselves captain marvel is an enormous resume booster and i was ecstatic to see her in the mcu
Mar 20 2020,positive,slow at first that last 13 of the movie was the best
Mar 19 2020,positive,very good movie bought it in 3d one of the best 3d movies that i have bought
Mar 18 2020,negative,the movie tries to be so many things at once and fails spectacularly at all of them
Mar 16 2020,positive,really enjoyed it captain marvel looked great it was also funny to see nick fury as well worth the watch
Mar 15 2020,negative,miss marvel was boring in the comics and shes boring in this movie
Mar 14 2020,positive,i loved it dont listen to the other bad reviews they are just threatened by the power that this woman has in a universe dominated by men just go and watch it yourself youll see 
Mar 13 2020,positive,cool flick i like her good movie personality 31120 worthy rewatch
Mar 12 2020,positive,while in some areas its entertaining the overall tone of the film is so meh that its the mcu film i watch the least
Mar 11 2020,positive,good movie by marvel worth watching a few times
Mar 11 2020,positive,a little bit more mediocre and cheesy for a marvel film for the studio it may be a bit of a low point but i wouldnt say its my least favorite marvel film all that easily
Mar 11 2020,negative,this movie was very boring  the actress who played captain marvel delivers wooden acting skills and makes way too many stupid faces     i hated it
Mar 8 2020,positive,nice actress and great photography cant save a poor script
Mar 8 2020,negative,unwatchable
Mar 7 2020,negative,atrocious only made big bucks because it was smack in the middle of infinity war and endgame
Mar 6 2020,negative,space invasion big car chase truth be told i was ready to hang it up till i met you today    one year later  nobodys talking about this expect for me right now all that fuss and name calling over an average by the book superhero movie    one of the blandest and most forgettable movies of last year which i just remembered to login as watched    brie larson who has proven in the past to be a talented actress with amazing range but is unfortunately the weakest link in the movie i thought her performance was incredibly wooden and the least interesting part of the movie her line delivery felt really off and there wasnt anything there for me to care about her character all backstory with very little depth it might have just been the poor material she was given to work with    im sorry but not once did i believe this is the strongest character in the mcu the issue is that the movie does a terrible job of actually showing us that she is powerful and important they tell us rather than show us like ok she shoots lasers flies around and has some magical glow around her am i suppose to be impressed    the story itself is really messy and unfocused its trying so hard to be an origin story while also setting up the next installment for future movies but also having a bourne element into the mix of connecting pieces to the past    also i cant believe they did lee pace dirty not just once but twice now    however there are some things i liked in the movie that stopped it from being the worst thing ever i love the tribute to stan lee on the marvel studios opening intro which was such a loving touch to his legacy    the deaging on samuel l jackson was fantastic and shows us how far technology has come although towards the end the effects started to look a bit wonky for some reason jackson himself was charismatic and a blast to watch it was interesting to see a younger and goofy version of nick fury before he gets super serious    i love goose the cat just dont let her anywhere near your eyes    the skrulls were enjoyable villains and ben mendelsohn absolutely shines as one of the skrulls    and thats really it for positives    overall rating being powerful is like being a lady if you have to tell people you are you arent  margaret thatcher    yes i actually took a quote from thatcher i honestly should just delete my account right now
Mar 6 2020,negative,one of the worst mcu movies in history disappointed
Mar 6 2020,negative,there is nothing compelling about this film  every single actor seems miscast including samuel l jackson playing the role that he has played in every other marvel film  i guess thats a testament to the character writing which seems to be irrevocably stuck on cliche and vacuous      the story itself jumps all over the place as if they are just inventing premises to tie the necessary plot points together  consequently there is almost unrelenting exposition through dialogue so that you can have some clue about what anyone is doing and why    its just so underwhelming    edit whoever decided on the music licensing for this should be severely reprimanded  nirvanas come as you are and holes celebrity skin ugh its just so disrespectful and cringey
Mar 4 2020,negative,just another generic super hero movie with an idiotic story and a protagonist who cant make us care about it with a total of zero charisma
Feb 29 2020,positive,its not a bad movie but its nowhere near the best to me i didnt really see a real conflict in the story like the stakes didnt seem very high captain marvels origin story is pretty unique and i like how they did the whole regaining your memory back thing but her character arc in the story was nonexistent her character arc was starting off as a super powerful person to ending as a super powerful person but now helping some aliens find a home   the whole twist of the good guys are actually the bad guys was an interesting concept but it was just so predictable like when my mom first watched it in the first 15 minutes she already knew that the twist was coming  also i feel like captain marvels character isnt that likable she is extremely powerful and basically has no weakness shes over confident which could work for some characters but her humor isnt funny the over confidence thing couldve gone well if she always fails at something but she doesnt she wins everything which makes her seem like a cocky asshole with a snarky attitude  also i genuinely feel like she shouldnt have been added to the mcu because she doesnt bring anything knew shes kind of just there and shes so powerful that now at this point most regular bad guys could be defeated by her with a single punch like the only person who was able to stop her was thanos when he wielded all 6 infinity stones basically making a literal god anything weaker she can just stick out her fist and blast them out of existence which isnt that fun to watch if they have literally no other weaknesses  i think the writers saw that we wanted a strong female superhero but they only inputted the strong bad ass side of it and not the human side of it
Feb 29 2020,positive,haters gonna hate but i really love this movie
Feb 29 2020,negative,bland and boring only watched it because of the midcredit scenes
Feb 27 2020,positive,i loved the movie the soundtrack brought me back to a great place i want more
Feb 27 2020,negative,captain marvel sucks and its one of the worst mcu movies i have ever seen at least all of the movies are better than captain marvel
Feb 26 2020,positive,i think captain marvel is good but received poor score from audience i saw that the plot and the lack of original from comic however bries perfomance received praise
Feb 25 2020,negative,great idea poorly executed in comparison with wonder woman captain marvel is in second place if one would change the role of captain marvel with a man the movie would have stayed the same i think that they maybe made captain marvel too powerful so that the peak of the story fell kinda flat since there was no real struggle evident with most of the scenes with the captains enemies after she got her powers
Feb 22 2020,positive,it was a welldone origin story that reached out especially to women viewers for that i appreciated the movie even more
Feb 22 2020,positive,here are some of the things i took away from and covered about the captain marvel film cgi was great in most parts bad in the space fights i felt that the reason we got captain marvel flying in space shooting down ships was that it looked great on a small screen but seeing in imax it was one of the moments where the cgi was not up to par     nostalgia was great listening to a bunch of hits from the 90s brought me back to my total request live days some songs were not a good fit but others were perfect wasnt a woman power movie like wonder woman though because ww did it first captain marvel did not have to play that up wonder woman is amazon so her calling out sexism made more sense i would have rolled my eyes if captain marvel would have beat up a guy and then say and you just got beat by a girl it worked for wonder woman but the impact of marvels first female lead movie falls a little flat to dc only because were not worried about having a great female lead superhero now thanks to wonder woman so its good that they didnt play up to the woman card at all     this felt like a paint by numbers marvel film which worked but there were so many scenes where i was like this feels like a thor moment that feels like ironman and this feels like a captain america there were a lot of killer moments that were all its own but too many that felt too much like the formula if that makes sense in my opinion better than ironman 2  3 thor 2 antman 2 doctor strange and tied with antman thor 3 avengers 2     the rest falls short of i give this movie you have to check it out because there are a few movies where i tell myself ive got to go back and see it again right out of the door as im headed to my car and i definitely said this to myself as i left this movie is exciting enough to watch multiple times it charges you up for the endgame despite my few nitpick i rank this film high im more excited to see what larson can do amongst earths mightiest heroes im curious to see how shell react to captain america and ironman this movie poked fun at a lot of things from the past that we take for granted today like highspeed internet blockbuster video and twoway pagers speaking of which im hoping for a moment in endgame where brie larson danvers looks around earth and asks where did all the blockbusters go and see if anyone blames it on the snap if you want to watch the full version of this review watch it on youtube click here to subscribe to our youtube channel
Feb 21 2020,negative,no build up no original storyline and weakest one dimensional characters ever in the mcu i think filmmakers thought that people already know everything about her through the internet and hype and they dont need to provide emphasis on how to develop a hero this is sad and i hope this isnt the direction where mcu is headed
Feb 20 2020,positive,liked the soundtrack hated having the 90s songs playing during the action scenes  they took me out of the moment and made the movie feel like a bad music video at times
Feb 19 2020,positive,love love love this movie  its not especially deep and thats okits basically just a 90s girl power movie but who cares when its this much fun  my only complaint is they damn well should have let the move be explicit in the very very obvious romantic attachment between the two women instead of cowardly pretending they were just close friends but other than that this was a blast from start to finish
Feb 18 2020,positive,this was an enjoyable film mostly due to the performances of ms larson and mr mendelsohn i enjoy how it subverted expectations for the skrulls
Feb 18 2020,negative,i feel like ms larson was just too wooden for the part the whole movie felt like a racing movie where the protagonist is behind and must win and so he simply shifts gears and go faster     a decent popcorn flick but im glad i paid 2 for redbox instead of 20 for a movie ticket
Feb 18 2020,negative,so boring and over hyped movie not recommended
Feb 18 2020,negative,the only thing of merit is the performances aside from brie larson who was surprisingly bad
Feb 17 2020,positive,fantastic one of marvels best
Feb 17 2020,positive,the direction is solid and the performances from the likes of brie larson and samuel l jackson is flawless and there are some inventive action sequences and moments the overall narrative is weak and uninspiring
Feb 17 2020,positive,throughout the first act watching this movie i very curious to see where the story plays in the already big marvel cinematic universe unfortunately i get bored quite easily from the middle into the end of the movie i believe brie larson is a great actress but her performance in this movie felt really stiff despite i can see her giving a lot of effort in carol danvers character samuel l jackson in the other hand is great as always as nick fury and probably my favourite part in this movie beside goose the cat the climax in this movie is very anticlimactic for a space battle involving mass destruction weapons and fleet the tension is almost nonexistent besides all of those problems the effectscgi in this movie is one of the best ive ever seen especially on awesome deageing they put on sam jackson that almost blend in right away from the first second i saw it on screen although how underwhelming my experience with this film i cant recommend other people to skip it because this small story plays some crucial part of a larger whole
Feb 17 2020,neutral,humorous and with a good twist but not anywhere near the best movies of the franchise
Feb 16 2020,negative,i didnt like not 1 i was not expecting that from mavel
Feb 16 2020,positive,it checks all the marvel boxes while being centered around a woman i was entertained laughed got some good action out of it all the people complaining about politics are actually the ones that should leave theirs at home
Feb 16 2020,positive,samuel l jackson as nick fury is brilliant in this film and the skrull twist is absolute genius however captain marvel can be unlikable at times the supreme intelligence is just a bit odd
Feb 16 2020,negative,just the fx are good
Feb 16 2020,negative,disappointing and overhyped they tried to hard
Feb 14 2020,neutral,its just like thor 2 a big fat meh with a side with boring
Feb 13 2020,positive,the movie although albeit generic and feels as if its a phase 1 movie helps to dial back the story a bit to further delve into a time period that hasnt been explored yet in the mcu further to not that scott mendelssohn and brie larsons performances were great although the antagonist was uninteresting and generic the movie had no love interest which was something different for a change as it chooses to look into the friendship between danver and rambaeu definite recommend and captain marvel can also inspire several young females
Feb 12 2020,negative,i think they were trying to hard
Feb 12 2020,positive,marvel films what i find most interesting about them all is for better and worse my opinion of them rarely changes that is to say unlike a richer drama or biopic etc my enjoyment of marvel blockbusters never depends on what state of mind im in or who im with theyre perfectly the same to me no matter what some other movies that i truly and completely love i rewatch sometimes and think theyre utter embarrassing rubbish then next time i love it again that is the exciting part of truly great movies they cant resonate within you all the time and some grow and flex with you both apart and together like some friends and family but marvel movies on the whole as theyve refined the formula over and over again are the fast food of movies im never disappointed and never overly satiated i know what to expect and theres a nice warm familiarity with that but im never challenged  i think thats ok in movie making but you cant have takeaway every day so i really like the marvel movies for exactly what they are i enjoy analysing them but only to compare them to each other not to actual movies    so with that in mind captain marvel is was good not better than say an antman and the wasp but just as good in a different way it was a lot more chilled out specifically it wasnt trying too hard trying to make you laugh every second to avoid you thinking about how little sense it all makes and it wasnt trying to display this global threat of annihilation in a way that we cant at all relate to and essentially it wasnt trying to be really tense all the time like some blockbusters that try to twist you up tighter for 100 minutes and not let go captain marvel marched to the beat of its own drum which actually tied nicely into the plot it was solid and fun and relaxed which is a change of pace    like brie larsons carol danvers theres a pervading chill to this flick a simplicity and not a hyperactivity that doesnt mean there isnt a nice smattering of action even if the third act is all cgi grimaces and smashy dc nonsense the plot is not at all surprising but its not cloying and its unafraid of slowing down here and there    i know i said it wasnt trying to be funny but that doesnt mean that it isnt yes theres clear and unforced chemistry between jackson and larson and theres a cool 90s lethal weaponxfilessuperman vibe to the film and the music but the standout was ben mendelsohn who is usually criminally underutilised or edited down but here he shines     mendelsohns talos wasnt the only thing that had a welcome lost 90s flavour of buffy the vampire slayer or angel i couldnt help but think that i would gladly take a netflix mini series reboot of buffy with bodenfleck and brie larson on the team     so theres a lovely deus ex cat a cameo that is maybe the greatest conceived cameo of all time an opening logo crawl that almost brought tears to my eyes a subtle but solid throwback soundtrack and an end fight scene that felt like a joyous celebration of a womans strength with a light touch an important message and an energy and exuberance that felt right    captain marvel is not overbearing and its not rubbish yeah itll be good after a hard days work and after all thats what these movies are for and i liked it more than black panther there i said it
Feb 12 2020,positive,a very good movie i loved the lead actress i felt it was a bit rushed over though should have been longer or the editing maybe could have been better
Feb 11 2020,positive,a good first outing for captain marvel while i enjoyed the movie and did really like it it reminded me of a phase one marvel movie rather than their more recent stuff itd be nice to see a more colourful and fun captain marvel movie but the villain twist is one of marvels best     brie larson kills it as carol danvers but the movie is stolen by a ginger flerken called goose
Feb 11 2020,positive,really little more than hey lets do a quick and sloppy genderswapped backstory on colsen how nick fury lost his eye pathetic and oh yeah that chick that saved the avengers    it was better than a pike in the eye with a sharp stick but nowhere near larsons best performance     apparently advanced civilizations havent discovered the hair tie or the ponytail
Feb 10 2020,positive,nice movie action is good
Feb 10 2020,negative,it seemed very rushed with a terrible story line and brie larson was the absolute wrong choice for this role
Feb 10 2020,positive,wondrous and powerful  larson is great so are themes of identity and limitations  excited to see more from this character
Feb 10 2020,positive,brie larson is amazing as captain marvel and confidence radiates throughout her performance
Feb 10 2020,negative,have to say that even as a marvel fan i greatly disliked this movie the worst of the mcu by a large margin
Feb 9 2020,negative,that was really really awful
Feb 9 2020,negative,it was  average because the main actor was poor nick fury helped pass the time with him playing a big role in the movie it is just about ok
Feb 9 2020,negative,it couldve been so much better even fury who i usually love was awful in this it just seemed like the whole tone of the movie was different from other marvel films and not in a good way the hero didnt act like a hero and the villain was harmless i did like the way they portrayed the cree in this that was interesting it didnt save the film though
Feb 8 2020,negative,boring bland uninteresting just a waste of time
Feb 7 2020,positive,better than wonder woman
Feb 7 2020,negative,i hate this movie maybe the worst marvel one except for thor  the dark world
Feb 7 2020,negative,a heartless corporate product pretending to be something more than it is which is a generic forgettable movie like most marvel flicks desperately trying to prove that girls can kick ass too problem is we know they can wonder woman came out two years earlier and did everything better than this turd
Feb 6 2020,positive,solid movie plot hindered by an invincible hero leaving little dramatension
Feb 6 2020,positive,the animation and comedy were the best features from this movie brie larson wasnt right for the job
Feb 6 2020,positive,another great film in the mcu
Feb 6 2020,negative,most boring and pointless marvel movie to date
Feb 5 2020,positive,the only thing i was hyped about in this movie was the set up for endgame and the secret invasion
Feb 5 2020,negative,disgusting trash marvel is better than this
Feb 4 2020,negative,this is by far the least enjoyable movie i have seen in recent history   brie larson is a terrible actress who clearly has trouble conveying any sense of emotion the plot is boring badly paced and uninteresting its at best a sad parody of the mcu  i pirated this movie and still paid too much for this movie
Feb 4 2020,negative,worst movie of mcu worst
Feb 4 2020,positive,an amazing mcu female centered moviedefinitely the mcus wonder woman just not as good 
Feb 3 2020,negative,this has to be the worst movie ive ever seen brie larssons acting was beyond cringeworthy the whole movie felt so dry definitely not worth watching
Feb 2 2020,negative,a movie that holds no excitement you dont cheer for the hero because the hero doesnt  look like she cares about what shes doing   she wins every fight easily so theres no threat to herthings just happen and arent any surprise
Feb 1 2020,positive,another very popular and controversial film and by controversial what i mean is it made a bunch of nerdbro jackasses on the internet mad for some reason i dont know some bullshit about brie larson hating white men or something even though she literally has nothing to do with the writing or production of the movie i dont get it anyway how is it its fine its like every single other middleoftheroad marvel solo movie ever made it takes no risks its safe unchallenging popcorn entertainment there are one or two things i thought this movie did really well the deageing effects are fantastic the 90s setting was fun and i kinda liked the star warsish vibe it had at times but other than that this is just a serviceable cookiecutter nothingspecialaboutit superhero movie how are the characters theyre fine the story its fine the action its fine the effects theyre fine the acting its fine the music its fine the comedy its fine the connections with the other movies theyre fine its fine its not as good as guardians of the galaxy but its not as bad as antman and the wasp its okay there were some kinda bad moments the writing and social commentary is extremely obvious and onthenose and there is an absolutely baffling music choice in one of the final battles that i feel is trying to be like an edgar wright movie or gotg but it just sticks out like a sore thumb but thats about it as far as actual issues i have with it there just isnt a lot about it that i think is especially good either i know this movie means a lot to a lot of people and i think thats great i dont really agree wonder woman did it first and did it better but im glad it did so well financially hopefully well get bigger and better movies like this out of it if you havent seen it already check it out if you like marvel movies skip it if youre like me and you dont really care
Jan 31 2020,positive,captain marvel its a good addition to the marvel cinematic universe and a visually stunning adventure keep it up marvel 68010
Jan 31 2020,positive,one of the best marvel movies
Jan 31 2020,positive,i dont understand the audience reviews on this one this movie was amazing a heartfelt story about embracing your past and not letting people define you it was very enjoyable loved captain marvel 
Jan 31 2020,positive,this movie was awesome
Jan 31 2020,positive,the weakest of marvels recent run of films with most of the blame laid at the feet of the central character the shield backstory and the cat provide most of the enjoyment with mr jackson voice providing the films only compelling performance
Jan 30 2020,negative,its not even entertaining 
Jan 30 2020,negative,why did marvel have to do this
Jan 29 2020,positive,its not my favorite mcu movie but still good
Jan 28 2020,neutral,this is my least favorite mcu film i am yet to see dark world but this is bad enough for now this film blew its chances at being a great femaleempowerment story the story itself jumps around and never focuses on the best elements none of the dramatic moments work for me also the excellent effects on the young nick fury arent enough to compensate for the unspectacular cgi elsewhere while there were some funny jokes and maybe one good fight scene this is just a below average film also i think brie larsons performance is really weak im sure many like her but i think shes the adam driver of mcu films overall its not bad but its certainly worse than mediocre especially compared to the mcus pantheon of great movies
Jan 28 2020,positive,i was thoroughly entertained it could have been better but great actors and over the top fx make up for a sub par plot and i love that cat 3
Jan 27 2020,neutral,first part of the movie was awesome then the plot started to flop the cgi was pretty bad but that was just my perspective there were good moments but the whole story seemed incomplete
Jan 27 2020,negative,cat samuel and skrull   good  main hero messy arrogant  trash
Jan 27 2020,negative,expected more from mcu
Jan 26 2020,negative,so much wrong in this no reason for allpowerful main character to fear no character growth and dozens of era mistakes they were too lazy to research for period pieces
Jan 26 2020,positive,first decent female character in a male fantasy franchise that doesnt use sex to sell the character makes the big bad of the guardians  of the galaxy look like a wimp good character development  of a character as good as any of marvels  other heroes as good as thor ragnorok  and better than most of the character introduction movies
Jan 26 2020,negative,boring bullshit with a boring heroes
Jan 26 2020,negative,how are you supposed to write a script when the protagonist is op that isnt a parody
Jan 23 2020,negative,captain marvel severely suffers from the same flaws of the superman franchise she has so much power that her entire character arc could be summed up in a simple sentence she used to fall every no and then but now shes so powerful that she believes that she doesnt need an interesting or compelling personality the entire plot of the movie is bland unoriginal and cookiecutterlike that they might as well of not made this movie as the only thing you need to know is not to expect any diversion of expectation to any degree because her power completely and utterly overrules any sort of logic or story telling
Jan 23 2020,negative,this is worst movie from all avengers movies
Jan 23 2020,positive,captain marvel is interesting i can guarantee you that if youve watched all the other marvel movies finding the connections to the previous movies is well quite fun but is that enough no it definitely isnt of the many flaws id like to point out the biggest one is the power balance i mean if the socalled mighty kree armada cant even last a few seconds against captain marvel then who can so i really hope marvel decides to balance thingshmm im starting to wonder if this movie is some kind of a game where i have to ask for a balance patch
Jan 22 2020,negative,by far the worse acting and the worse movie the story is pathetic and the pc imposition disgusting 10yrs of a good job destroyed for pc reasons
Jan 22 2020,positive,fought for my rights 
Jan 22 2020,neutral,it doesnt exceed in my expectations at all it gets boring all throughout the movie the story telling is quite a mess and i cant see that much of a character development on brie larson
Jan 21 2020,negative,it wasnt a terrible movie like most people say it is it wasnt as awful as saying iron man 2 and 3 but it was a complete snooze fest nothing exciting or interesting nor surprising ever happens for a character that practically represents marvel and is named after it    if you enjoy an incredibly generic film with barely average acting that helps pass the time while you slow cook your roast than this would be a good choice
Jan 21 2020,negative,this movie didnt click with me at all
Jan 20 2020,positive,it wasnt the greatest mcu movie but still very enjoyable samuel l jackson  brie larson had great chemistry together  ben mendelsohn was great as talos im looking forward to the sequel
Jan 20 2020,negative,im a marvel fan and have seen all of the movies in this marvel series i always got excited when theres another marvel movie coming out but this one was trash after they signaled for captain marvel at the end of avengers infinity war i was super hyped that captain marvel was coming to save the day that was until the movie came out and it ended up being an origin movie and really didnt continue the dramatic plot that we saw at the end of infinity war and antman 2 i actually thought this movie was super boring 
Jan 19 2020,positive,while it need an improvement i think it delivered enough to the standards of a normal mcu movie but considering it was the first female superhero movie for the mcu my expectations were higher than my reality here
Jan 19 2020,negative,brie larson was cold and unlikable the movie relied on simplistic plot and cgi samuel l jacksons deaging was merely creepy
Jan 19 2020,positive,i enjoyed it but not loved it samuel l jackson is really funny in this movie 
Jan 19 2020,positive,an admirable but ultimately bythenumbers superhero origin film  captain marvel is basically a better version of the green lantern movie but not much else  still it has some genuine humor good performances and enough fun action to make it watchable  though its not the greatest look when everything about your movie is completely upstaged by a cat
Jan 18 2020,positive,other than purely out of sexism i dont understand why people seem to hate this movie in my opinion it is one of the better marvel movies and is able to stand on its own without much knowledge of its predecessors it could easily lean into the girl power aspects but doesnt and allows carol to be feminine and not fall into the masculine tropes that movies tend to put strong women into her emotions are a strength instead of a weakness and caring about people is not shown as something bad she can be strong and arrogant without being cold there is also nothing in this movie saying that women are better than men or that men are stupid both genders are working together as equals again i just do not see any of the reasons to hate this despite why is there a girl in my boy movies it sucks that the world is still at this point
Jan 18 2020,negative,really was a awful movie
Jan 17 2020,neutral,meh sums it up as a woman i can say that subtlety can go a long way especially for a fanbase like marvel comics there was no subtely in this film and im not a fan of feeling patronized by an actress playing herself nonetheless i always enjoy the marvelness of marvel movies
Jan 16 2020,negative,this product is an embarrassment a golden standard of what a group of talentless people can achieve together it is bad as a part of mcu it would be bad as a standalone blockbuster i can tolerate cheap cgi i dont care about them i can tolerate the plot holes but poor acting by an awful cast is too much to handle  this is something that you have to hatewatch just for the after the movie scene this is something that you can skip and lose nothing
Jan 16 2020,negative,just wasnt a fan of the movie overall whats very perplexing is can any critic please tell me how you were able to rate this at 78 but joker which is up for the most academy award nominations of the year including best picture is only 69 and not certified fresh do people even watch these movies
Jan 16 2020,negative,personally i think its only the second worst mcu movie thats why it gets a whole start instead of half
Jan 16 2020,neutral,solidly alright production is great all the supporting characters are great direction is ok plot is cool but brie larson is the problem ive never seen a more bland one dimensional performance she couldnt have less personality if she tried i dont know what her and the director were going for but the character that resulted is basically just smug bland and boring really nothing to like about her character and shes the titular lead
Jan 15 2020,negative,movies not garbage but the message is its way too cliche and generic that has been plaguing contemporary media
Jan 15 2020,negative,this movie completely underwrites one of the best comic book storylines ever written under marvel
Jan 15 2020,negative,this felt like marvel isnt even trying anymore or maybe they just list touch with their audience the whole thing comes off as a halfbaked attempt to shove another character into infinity war before the release to rake in more cash
Jan 15 2020,negative,so boring that it made green lantern look like a blockbuster
Jan 14 2020,positive,great movie nothing wrong w it
Jan 14 2020,negative,if you like to watch a person so uninterested in anything doing super hero stuff then this is your movie  if you like good acting or good story skip this
Jan 13 2020,positive,its a nice moviebut the villains involved was not toughthey made her look unbeatable without any weaknessbut i believe everyone has a weaknessthey should try there best to involve more tough villains and challenges
Jan 13 2020,neutral,its just dull and forgettable thats the problem larson needs to gel with the mcu formula more and her character comes across man of steel like with just being a basic unstoppable god
Jan 13 2020,negative,booooooring skip it charisma less hero dumb abd
Jan 12 2020,negative,why marvel why  the movie was bad the storyline was mediocre and predictable from the first minute samuel l jackson was very good brie larson was anyway why marvel hired her she cant act  definitely the weakest marvel movie
Jan 12 2020,positive,each scene is amazing this movie exceeded my expectations every scene has an incredible climax the time flashes and twists cause the viewer to become glazed in the movie not to mention the special effects that are excellent
Jan 11 2020,positive,marvel movies are a guarantee of success and quality its a fun and light movie enjoyable to watch but its nothing special and nothing new it suffers from being the umpteenth origin story its fine but one of the weakest entries in the mcu
Jan 9 2020,positive,captain marvel is the most powerful superhero yet cant wait to see more of her
Jan 9 2020,neutral,i wish they put more of some things and less of others captain marvel is just too invincible and stoic to be a compelling character
Jan 9 2020,negative,mediocre and boring the formula is tired and although brie larson tries pretty hard its obvious that she cannot do comedy  brie trying to be something other than smug and arrogant is painful and cringeworthy this character is essentially a flawless god now and who cares
Jan 8 2020,negative,boring characters predictable plot and it felt like an unnecesary and improvised movie in the mcu
Jan 8 2020,positive,it has a good amount of funny moments but overall it kinda felt lackluster for introducing marvels most powerful hero you would think it would have more action i counted it has 38 minutes the credits are 14 minutes which means the credits are close to 13 of the action but the twists and action sequences are pretty cool overall its a 710 for me not as bad as everyone says but not as good as critics say its a good movie to watch when board if you have disney
Jan 7 2020,negative,it looked good had some moments of good humor but the story was boring and predictible while the lead actress isnt necessarily a bad actress she just didnt have the acting range to lead the film i think there would have been a lot of other female choices to lead it it pretty much felt like the actors of the side characters carried the film forward if it was an independent small film this would be a great film but marvel has set a standard and this one is definitely bellow it
Jan 6 2020,negative,bad characters with too much dumb fanservice and a plot far too messy for the regular fan to comprehend 410
Jan 6 2020,negative,meh couldnt really pay attention to it although some scenes were great samuel l jacksons performance was awesome as always and brea was good honestly the movie drags so much its probably most likely okay its the worst film in the mcu to date
Jan 6 2020,negative,brie larsons performance is painful the characters and dialogue are stiff and boring the main character has the entertainment value of an empty cardboard box
Jan 5 2020,negative,i want to avoid talking directly about the  plot so as to avoid spoilers as there may very well be people who would enjoy this flick  it was a bland movie without a heros journey making the mistake of telling us how powerful the hero is rather than showing us when compared to contemporary femaleled action flicks like alita battle angel or wonder woman  taking a step back and looking at the movie critically the movie in terms of marketing and the script was more about pushing a narrative rather than telling a story      there is very little about the movie that is memorable or evokes in me any emotional attachment to mcu or mc content other than being unnecessarily shoehorned in as a mustsee movie before endgame  into the spiderverse was as meaningful to the endgame story as captain marvel was      a huge mistake as the introduction of mcus next phase would have been more impactful if our introduction to vers was in endgame creating interest and questions surrounding captain marvel and then releasing captain marvel shortly after as a bridging movie going forward    perhaps my disappointment in this movie is derived from my marvel fandom in general and the positioning of the movie in particular  either way id rather watch anything else
Jan 5 2020,positive,great family film with great action loved the ensemble and the empowering story     so glad its on disney
Jan 5 2020,negative,boring and flat as a tortilla
Jan 4 2020,positive,i really enjoyed all of the nineties nostalgia that was included  other than that it was a typical super hero movie  nothing too special
Jan 4 2020,negative,marvel uses its normal textbook style material to tell captain marvels story but for some reason makes it extremely boring and unflavorful unlike the other textbook films
Jan 3 2020,positive,captain marvel was an enjoyable watch that i learned has a significant spot in the mcu i think her friend maria lashana lynch couldve had a better reaction to seeing her friend who was supposedly dead for six years i liked the twist but it seemed like an odd way of getting there im all for letting child actors flex their acting muscles but sometimes precocious kids are more annoying than endearing i loved the scene where captain marvel brie larson kicks some ass to no doubts just a girl captain marvel is definitely worth the watch even if youre not the biggest mcucomic book movie fan oh and goose the cat gets 100100 for his performance of course
Jan 3 2020,negative,not much happened was expecting better
Jan 3 2020,positive,it was a decent movie however was not very exciting at times and was sometimes boring in the second act
Jan 2 2020,negative,i did not watch this in the theater i am very glad i didnt  visually this movie is on par with other marvel options however the entire movie was a bust for me  i dont care about the controversy that surrounded the film  but the lack of a good story made this movie a big miss for me   main character felt flat for me and the lack of any real arc for her hurt the relationship we were supposed to have with her   i honestly felt more connected to the supporting characters than i did for bre larson  totally missed the mark on this film  totally skippable without losing anything for other marvel projects
Jan 2 2020,positive,good but not enought
Jan 2 2020,positive,it answered a lot of questions and filled in a bunch of gaps left in the mcu i really enjoyed the 90s throwback with some of my favorite bands from that era
Jan 2 2020,negative,did not enjoy the story telling rewrite of the first avenger status fro captain america
Jan 1 2020,positive,a good superhero flick
Dec 31 2019,negative,if you enjoy dumb plots lame superheroes and bad jokes this is the perfect movie for you but seriously dont waste your time
Dec 30 2019,negative,that was pretty bad one of the worst movies ive watched in a while its interesting that marvels bad movies share a similar flavor of emptybythenumbers action movies to them whereas the good ones almost have this pixarmeetsscifiaction tone to them meh concept poor execution
Dec 30 2019,positive,sam jackson and brie larson cop movie please
Dec 30 2019,negative,yeah its terrible
Dec 30 2019,negative,captain marvel is a one and done experiance for me i cant imagine a sequel will have anything new to say
Dec 30 2019,positive,really enjoy this movie the sjw message is not very overpowering unlike other movies and love danvers character just for how sarcastic she is
Dec 30 2019,positive,great movie she needs more movies
Dec 29 2019,negative,bland i waited all this time to finally see captain marvel and damn this is the most generic movie the main character is so flat and im just bored and some of the dialogue makes zero sense a child who lost their dad would never urge their only living parent onto a death mission no heroes journey and hard ti swallow character development 
Dec 29 2019,positive,captain marvel is not either good or bad its a generic and bland entry to the mcu and larson gives a bland and generic performance it doesnt even really add up to the whole cinematic universe but if you want a superheroine punching bad guys for the sake of it this is your movie
Dec 28 2019,negative,never thought about watching such a disappointing mcu movie more overpowered then rey in star wars so there is never a whiff of tension
Dec 28 2019,negative,the good the bad and the ugly but in this case theres nothing good  just bad and ugly  new actress to play the main role is in desperate need
Dec 28 2019,positive,a good step for the first female lead in the mcu
Dec 28 2019,negative,there was no real stakes here we know she lives because of infinity war and she is too powerful never really facing any adversity
Dec 28 2019,positive,theres a lot of gate going towards bri larson and her roll as captain marvel but its un just and just overall stupid bri larson is the perfect match to portray captain marvel the back story we get is fantastic while the excitement we get for the setting up of the final avengers film is spot on
Dec 27 2019,positive,captain marvel review lets get started so captain marvel was great to see in my opinion the story was great and the tone love the cast and all the characters in this movie brie larson did a great job as ms marvel or captain marvel i enjoy this movie my score for captain marvel is 710 great job marvel you did it once again 
Dec 27 2019,negative,bad movie who wants to watch a movie with no real threats to the main character did a child write this plot
Dec 27 2019,positive,another really fun marvel experience  i wish captain marvel had a little more emotion with her character though
Dec 27 2019,positive,its fine at this point youve seen this movie 12 times its better then several of those worse than a couple just another marvel movie but honestly thats all i wanted
Dec 27 2019,negative,just how super are her super powers  one minute she is pinned down by a pinball machine and the next minute she is soaring through space destroying space ships hmmm glad i watched this at home as it would have been a waste of a trip to the cinema
Dec 27 2019,negative,if these kinds of movies with these kinds of actresses is the direction marvel will take i will be passing on these movies from here on
Dec 27 2019,positive,loved it fits perfectly in the marvel universe and a great intro to the character
Dec 26 2019,negative,found this one to be my least favorite of the marvel movies fell asleep while trying to watch this multiple times
Dec 26 2019,negative,there is good in it ben mendelsohn even if hes covered in ridiculous amount of make up manages to act really well and infuse this soulless movie with a lot of charm    unfortunately captain marvel herself is shown as an emotionless soldier in the beginning an emotionless human in the middle and an emotionless hero in the end theres nothing relatable about the character and the movie therefore just passes you by even while it has some surprising elements in store
Dec 25 2019,positive,the movie itself was rather mediocre but i really do not understand the criticism of brie larson  she did very well with a middling script
Dec 25 2019,negative,it looks good but then all marvel movies look good brie larson though comes off as so stiff and cold she couldnt generate chemistry with anyone or any thing the rest of the cast did such a better job acting human even the ones who werent human it makes larson look the most alien i enjoyed the soundtrack the most
Dec 25 2019,positive,amazing movie truly refrenshing to see a female lead in a marvel movie and played so well by brie larsson
Dec 25 2019,negative,this movie was everything everybody was talking about its just simply bad take that however you want it yes i am a man that must be the reason
Dec 25 2019,positive,an entertaining refreshing movie with a strong female lead who learns to lead and trust herself  slightly better than the wonderwoman standalone movie  the diversity and feminism in captain marvel is organic not forced and artificial like in other movies the last jedi  love the cat and sam jackson  brie larson was well cast as alternately serioussnarky carol danvers  supporting cast was good
Dec 24 2019,negative,i have this power and i dont know where it came from   she must be referring to her power to offend nearly everyone with her horrible personality and arrogance
Dec 24 2019,negative,yawn boring plot boring characters an extremely underwhelming antagonist look forward to never watching again
Dec 24 2019,negative,what a mess  so much positioining such little fun 
Dec 24 2019,positive,a bit slow at times but far from bad
Dec 24 2019,positive,i really liked it dont understand why the reviews arent that good i would encourage any marvel fan to watch
Dec 24 2019,neutral,it wasnt a great movie only for before endgame story and mcu continuation part thats it screenplay direction and brie larson performed wasnt great just average
Dec 24 2019,positive,i thought it was good tells you how nick fury gets his eye patch
Dec 24 2019,negative,dont know what happened to the mcu but this is shockingly bad
Dec 23 2019,negative,the protagonist is as horrible as the movie
Dec 23 2019,negative,green lantern was better the two films were comparable imo person gets magical space power becomes glowy and uses cgi to defeat bad guy the difference is that one movie actually had a solid lead actor there is an overemphasis on calling out carol danvers for acting emotionally which made no sense as she never acted emotionally theres this great scene at the end where jude laws character goads her into a fight and it would have showed strength of character to either walk away or actually fight him and beat him fairly instead she just shoots him i fail to see the strength of any character who acts like that this movie lacks any charm or depth if it wasnt connected to the marvel brand name i expect it would have done much worse
Dec 23 2019,positive,drops the ball in iii act but overall fun movie
Dec 23 2019,negative,i dont need to be taught a lesson when im watching a movie thanks but no thanks
Dec 23 2019,negative,got a headache after watching the movie extremely disappointing
Dec 22 2019,positive,goes back to the basic mcu origin formula so it feels a bit redundant not bad
Dec 22 2019,negative,i tried to like this one but it was boring at best samuel l jackson did the best he could with what was written for him but most of the cast just didnt seem like they wanted to be there no emotions
Dec 22 2019,positive,despite its few flaws the movie is very pleasant and is not afraid to confront and tear down stereotypes
Dec 22 2019,negative,i still cant believe the difference between audience and critics for this movie its just a bad movie captain marvel is an antagonist who has a change of heart done end of movie
Dec 21 2019,negative,this movie was just terrible there was a multitude of holes in the plot and it didnt even stick anywhere near to the comics it deserved to be booed in the theatre
Dec 21 2019,negative,dear god was the movie awful
Dec 21 2019,positive,a solid introduction to an awesome character with some twists and turns along the way
Dec 21 2019,negative,boring movie with a protagonist that is far too powerful for there to be any tension or moments of worry
Dec 21 2019,negative,best thing about this movie was the flerken absolutely hilarious movie overall was okay besides brie larsons stale performance
Dec 21 2019,positive,pretty standard marvel stuff but still well done lots of fun
Dec 21 2019,negative,captain marvel was cinematically a good movie but the attitude of the main character ruined any joy i could have gotten from the story 
Dec 21 2019,neutral,terrible film and acting from the lead role its a bit unfortunate that this film went the direction of political correctness and such i feel this film deserved better with a better lead actress as well as a more solid plot that makes sense in terms of character progression and movie storytelling the movie had its good moments where it was exciting but then very quickly left a sour taste when it had forced scenes that seemed out of place
Dec 20 2019,negative,probably the weakest of any of the marvel movies of the last 10 years brie larson who is normally a fantastic actor gives a stiff and unlikable performance in a poorly written story that you honestly can skip over entirely it provides nothing important in the overall narrative of the marvel cinematic universe other than how captain marvel came to become who she is the cgi deaging technology is horrible dont waste your time 155
Dec 20 2019,neutral,like a marvel green lantern all sfx and no story worth caring about 
Dec 20 2019,negative,my least favorite of the marvel cinematic universe films to this point stale acting overpowered hero and unlikable protagonist
Dec 20 2019,negative,the weakest of them all there is no stakes
Dec 20 2019,negative,lifeless main character with dubious motivations becomes super powerful  can beat anyone  can do no wrong very forgettable unlikeable character marvel made sure she barely appeared in the avengers entry  were smart to do so
Dec 20 2019,positive,i enjoyed this movie but it is less successful than other marvel movies at establishing its main character and what shes all about still i had fun and hope well see more of captain marvel
Dec 20 2019,positive,its one of the lesser marvel films but it still does a good job with its first lead female
Dec 20 2019,negative,booooring very bad acting bad script bad story
Dec 20 2019,positive,definitely worth seeing it if you watched  the saga predictable vague in some way
Dec 20 2019,positive,i like that its different than your average origin story and its great to finally see a female lead in a mcu film but its difficult to sympathize with your lead character when shes not given much emotional territory to explore b
Dec 20 2019,negative,felt like a high budget made for tv movie main character is a op no character development just lots of spectacle the villains in the story get little development and are no match for her opness
Dec 20 2019,negative,terrible movie not worth the money
Dec 19 2019,positive,good movie for the first half but then it falls and becomes something disgusting to the nose in the 2nd act
Dec 19 2019,negative,movie was the blandest marvel movie i had ever seen and ive seen the first two thors
Dec 19 2019,negative,parts of the movie sorta drug for me  wish it was a better version of ms marvel and her og costume too cuz she was always a sexpot in the comics but i guess disney gotta tone it down  the fight scenes were pretty awesome  loved the interactions between marvel and fury so happy to have coulson back albeit in a prequel movie
Dec 19 2019,positive,its another solid marvel origin story it follows very similar story beats to that of other mcu solo outings  it has some fun character moments in between the cgi heavy battles it works as a fun marvel flick but doesnt quite reach the level of wonder woman  brie larson is an excellent character actor but she feels restrained by the script and you cant help but feel some revelations in this film just feel underwhelming  its still a fun mcu solo outing and the post credit scene sets up endgame very nicely
Dec 19 2019,negative,boring offers nothing are you sure it was a good idea to make this movie
Dec 18 2019,negative,i was upset because my boyfriend didnt want to watch this but when we went he saw it because he thought it would be relevant to the avengers end game but it wasnt and i actually the one that begged and pleaded to go  fell asleep writhing 30 min of the movie starting woke up and was upset because this was the first time ive ever slept during a marvel film i have slept through most dc movies but never a marvel movie lmao   she was bland as was the movie after forcing myself to watch this at home and seeing her in end game was pointless and a waste of film time and a paycheck shouldve donated to the hungry or something instead of paying her for  getting a hair cut in end game and being a bore in her own movie  
Dec 18 2019,negative,honestly one of the worst movies ive ever seen everything felt empty without substance the plot was linear predictable and boring the characters were extremely unlikable the 90s nostalgia fell flat and really didnt make me feel like the movie was set in the 90s it still felt like a modern superhero movie one star for really good animation and cgi but thats about it
Dec 18 2019,negative,soulless piece of trash disappointing compared to earlier marvel movies
Dec 18 2019,negative,this movie was absolutely trash starring mary sue
Dec 18 2019,positive,whitts marvel flick
Dec 18 2019,positive,captain marvel is definitely not even close to most of the other mcu movies but it still keeps that mcu feel it is very fun and enjoyable at times carol is some what of a likeable character but it is a really good origin for her
Dec 17 2019,negative,marvel made a bad mistake in delivering such an apathetic and uninspiring film that even affects brie larsons acting  it is difficult to embark on a story that at first has so dark photography and confusing history that after an hour it seems to have found its tone  it is little and even annoying such a character treatment for marvel
Dec 16 2019,neutral,expected much more no where near some other marvel movies
Dec 15 2019,positive,true to marvel and well done
Dec 14 2019,negative,horrible film average acting below average story lots of impressive special affects that dont improve the film a boring film trying to be a action film dont waste your time i should have asked for my money back
Dec 14 2019,positive,better than i expected still completely forgettable brie larson was not a good casting she can act for sure and is very committed but sadly is not very likable
Dec 13 2019,negative,the movie was a nightmare to watch
Dec 12 2019,negative,it was shit really no substance at all lol
Dec 12 2019,negative,worst mcu movie of all
Dec 12 2019,negative,it seemed to be shoehorned into the story
Dec 11 2019,positive,underrated not the best mcu film but still enjoyable and fun i love samuel jackson in this film
Dec 11 2019,neutral,wouldnt recommend if it wasnt in the mcu larsons performance is unlikable but jackson is great and his deaging looks really impressive mendelssohn is also a really great character that provides some much needed humour to the film
Dec 10 2019,negative,no character no real suspense no real danger the actress doesnt even respect the role enough to be physically invested takes a question of her exercise routine as an insult
Dec 10 2019,positive,its good 710 my rating
Dec 10 2019,positive,i dont know why but this was the first mcu movie in years that i just did not like the only thing that got it above 2 stars was goose the cat
Dec 10 2019,positive,this film was a fun ride from start to finish we finally get to see carol danvers story on the big screen brie larson expertly portrays captain marvel in a convincing way and the cgi added to the scenes allows you to seemingly see yourself there with the heroes being the first female solo marvel movie is important and it is great that this film is entertaining and fun
Dec 9 2019,negative,an objectively bad movie
Dec 9 2019,negative,horrible one of the worst movies i saw in my life
Dec 9 2019,positive,a real shame marvels first femaleled superhero movie they had the opportunity to prove all of the many doubters wrong however the result was just another run of the mill origin story feeding off of the franchises previous success without adding anything original or interesting it was an overall wellmade movie however if it is viewed as a standalone film it does not stack up
Dec 9 2019,negative,terrible and soulless shit film brie larson had nothing to offer in this film besides being boring easily one of the worst mcu film around
Dec 9 2019,neutral,the movie was good however it was also very cheesy and she became way to over powered for no reason
Dec 9 2019,negative,its just not a good movie really simple as thatone could pick apart aspects of this movie be it the acting dialogue or script its just so so and tbh rather boring unless youre a teenage girl maybe and then i can see how it could be enjoyed 
Dec 8 2019,negative,i tried to qualify this horrible movie with zero but it is impossible
Dec 8 2019,positive,despite what others may say about the movie i really think this is one of my favorites honestly dont see the hate people are spreading i really thought this movie was fire always gave me goosebumps
Dec 8 2019,neutral,the storys pretty weak  it consists mostly of a collection of your typical scifi tropes and a whole host of flat characters the biggest of which being marvel herself  and brie larson is very much miscast however theres a few amusing parts and enough of marvels typically explosive action sequences to perhaps make it worth your while
Dec 8 2019,negative,if captain marvel was a man the movie still would have been bad nothing to do with bree larson it was just not a good movie
Dec 7 2019,negative,destroys original captain marvel gives no growth to character by leaving out her transition from ms to captain hackney job mixing in personal politics with story
Dec 7 2019,negative,tell me this isnt what we are teaching our daughters to act like and praising it for the awful lessons its teaching the next generation please it was a really badly written movie
Dec 6 2019,negative,horrible movie made just to pander
Dec 6 2019,positive,the story leaves a lot to be desired but brie larson shines as marvels most powerful hero yet
Dec 6 2019,positive,i think this was a pretty good movie for something that was shoehorned in at the last minute before endgame came out not to mention its about time for a marvel female hero with her own movie
Dec 6 2019,negative,a missed opportunity sadly 
Dec 6 2019,negative,this movie  is bad so many holes in it just a cash grab  seen it for free and that was paying to much
Dec 5 2019,negative,i already didnt want to watch this movie at the cinema while i watched every other superhero movie in the cinema for at least one now you can just watch it on the telly im way to happy to make the trip there and made it easier to skip parts like almost the whole movie
Dec 5 2019,positive,another great intro film to the marvel cinematic universe brie larsons captain marvel is funny smart powerful and emotional superhero ride enjoyable for any fans of marvel films 
Dec 5 2019,negative,if i could rate 0 stars i would worst mcu movie
Dec 5 2019,positive,i really enjoyed this movie i think it is possibly one of the best super hero films ive ever seen what i liked about the movie   1 the star brie larson i liked everything about her character and ms larsons acting style physical appearance and the fact that she moved like an athlete how she moved reminded me of a gymnast 2 the supporting cast all did a good job especially the young actress that played the daughter her performance was so much better than many actors in her age group 3 the plot was straightforward with enough twists to keep me engaged to the end of the film 4 the film would not have been as good as it is without the directors skills 5 the film had a real life feel to it that many super hero films dont i think at this point capt marvel might be my favorite character in the mcu
Dec 4 2019,neutral,entertaining fun and that adds new elements to this universe it is why captain marvel is a correct movie however that does not take away from her lack of charisma that her protagonist has her script problems and one less step in marvel movies
Dec 4 2019,negative,written in six hands the script suffers from a lack of originality that is reflected in its way of imitating structures and resources in addition it again suffers from common mistakes in similar products such as a poor and anecdotal treatment of villains and an insipid and impersonal tone with comic moments that fail to mask the poor evolution of the characters and precipitous decisions and lack of dramatic justification
Dec 4 2019,negative,boring no character development bad story line horrible dialouge but the cat was kinda fun and ben mendolsohn was amazing as always
Dec 3 2019,negative,the only problems the movie had was its plot the main character and how everything flowed together  carol sucks bad role model bad at being a person her entire character just seems to boil down to strong woman 5922 which is to say bland uninteresting yet always successful and unstoppable she has no depth shes meant o be smart funny strong skilled etcbut we dont see that she has full control of her powers despite them only being suppressed and used as shooty beamsbut she can fly somehow breath make herself invulnerable just because at the endno struggle no training just done she makes superman look interesting  the plot is dumb if kree just killed her they win end hell if she just died in the explosionwhich is what logically would happen when you hit a huge mass of energy with a fucking energy weapon no she just gets super powers no scars burns or repercussions just knocked out  the only one who helps make this not be bottom of the barrel garbage is sam j man can act and best friend she was okay should have made her captain marvel i feel like she would have done much better
Dec 3 2019,negative,seems like green lantern plot with a female lead with the cat having more charisma then the titular hero of the movie
Dec 3 2019,positive,it had its moments
Dec 2 2019,positive,captain marvel is certainly a fun romp but it kind of lacks the unique vision of more recent solo mcu projects like spiderman homecoming thor ragnarok and black panther at worst it feels only average and at best it feels like a really fun joyride there is a plot development right around the end of the second act that subverted my expectations and i enjoyed it
Dec 2 2019,negative,few laughs here and there among heaps of unfunny quips uninspired actionand a week story and villains as a big fan of female superheros this was a missed opportunity and great disappointment
Dec 1 2019,negative,me least favourite marvel film the chemistry was terrible between characters and the main character just had no character growth at all she won the fight scene at the end exactly how she won the fight scene at the very start no growth never loses any fight never has any struggles nothing she cant overcome easily how could this be enjoyable horrible movie ben mendelsohn was the only light in an otherwise poor marvel outing
Dec 1 2019,positive,an impressive and fun movie
Dec 1 2019,negative,the only thing keeping the half star is the fact that we get to see how fury lost his eye
Nov 30 2019,negative,it was very mediocre for the budget they had they treated the story very superficially they couldve created an awesome story and the character of carol danvers was just messy and not very polished its clear that they had to stay in the marvel format and had to do what the studio dictated i doubt any director worth their salt would consider this good its a shame they didnt listen to the creative people and just pushed for cash unfortunately this movie wont age well
Nov 29 2019,negative,just useless marvel trying to fill a gap in their plans only good part of the movie is fury even though it was a disappointing reveal of how he lost his eye
Nov 29 2019,negative,its nothing special nothing to watch here
Nov 28 2019,positive,loved it a mustsee movie
Nov 28 2019,negative,lets be clear  it aint the comicbook character we are talking about or the audience that knows her or needs her it is the story and the plot of this movie that is on the chopping block    as an originintroduction movie it pulls a damon lindeloff remember the jerk behind prometheus tomorrow land and star trek into darkness and saves all the important investment information for the end of the film so our heroes can run around in circles to the middle of nowhere several times      as an action movie it put all of its budget into a young cgi samual l jackson petting cats say what you will about the lack of polish in black panther but i would rather see exciting scenes with mostly rendered leopard ninjas and war rhinos than a stunt man dressed as a grandma poll dancing    as an empowering heroine film ladies and gentlemen get a piece of paper and a pen write columns in 00 10 20 30 and etc representing units of 10 minutes in this film then watch the film whenever something funny endearing pathos filled sad exciting cheerful or emotional comes out of our heroines mouth or body language write it down in its appropriate column use any personal taste to fudge the results as you like but you will get to the 50 minute mark realizing you spent an hour with a truly blank slate character    because some wise guy thought that is how you outsmart origin story fatigue by saving the reasons we want the character to endure succeed or just continue to be on screenfor after the plot    in 40 years when someone wants to reboot this whole mcu thing maybe they can try this again that instead of having the brilliant idea of an average everyday office girl buzz lightyear slowly remember that she used to be a biker chick with friends and opinions but was brain washed into becoming a buzz lightyearhave the brain washing be subtle enough so her personality is intact we get to like the hotshot biker chick who thinks she is an alien and it is her personality finding out and picking apart the mind control  like imagine if captain america was brain washed by stalin he would still be a boy scout helping feed orphans in stalingrad give him an old man friend who claims to be the last of the romanovs when he is drunk and still goes around fighting evil bank robbers and murderers while the whole time saluting stalin and communist russia then an order from stalin sends him on a mission that does not feel morally right his moral compass intact and all his cheeky personality quirks but now the programming is rubbing against it wait i am fighting evil right but this american i am fighting is not fighting back calling me steve i am sven not steve right why do i rememberbrooklyn    yes a more predictable plot but if you are only smart enough tomake a pizza and not a soufflé just make the damn pizza the best way you know how
Nov 28 2019,negative,wooden acting by larson
Nov 27 2019,negative,bad plot like a alien cat just apear with no explanation of how and why got there and no questions ask   and they disrespect fury and the action could be better
Nov 27 2019,positive,a little setback from mcu standard established in the last decade
Nov 26 2019,negative,terrible bland and boring both the movie and protagonist
Nov 26 2019,negative,boring character least favorite mcu movie to date fury was relegated to a b player when the guy is an alpha
Nov 25 2019,positive,fun and feminist addition to the mcu the soundtrack brings back good memories of the 1990s 
Nov 25 2019,negative,brie larson has no charisma the action was uninspired just plain boring
Nov 25 2019,positive,a wonderful fun cosmic adventure set on the 90s
Nov 25 2019,negative,what a flaming piece of garbage for a movie doesnt belong in the mcu it was weird and awkward dialogue with horrible acting all the while ruining furys character
Nov 24 2019,negative,captain marvel lacks originality and what made other marvel movies so beloved good humor good action and good characters this movie has none of that and comes off as a total rip off of ghost in the shell 2017
Nov 23 2019,positive,samuel l jackson is at his best in this movie and the deaging technology is brilliant as a comic book fan i did really enjoy the skrull twist however this film suffers the way a lot of marvel films do by using villians who are just the same character but bad and this one is probably its weakest villian brie larson stinks in this film
Nov 23 2019,negative,boring silly story very bad acting
Nov 23 2019,positive,its much better than i expected but once again marvel formula hits and gives it an ending it didnt deserve
Nov 22 2019,negative,i think the actress acting wasnt so good and the way nick fury lost his eye couldve been different
Nov 22 2019,negative,the main actor is just not very likable and the story was a bit ridiculous was just a money grab by marvel before endgame special effects were great tho
Nov 21 2019,positive,it was ok but i would have expected more from the marvel universe
Nov 21 2019,positive,bl looks fun in bed but shes still a bad cast the movies still better than im3 thor 1  thor 2 which were really bad mcu movies
Nov 21 2019,negative,generic basic boring and brie larson is a wanna be badass it provides nothing new and should not have been made has nothing to do with it being a female lead she just isnt convincing and there are better female led movies out now like terminator dark fate
Nov 21 2019,positive,not that bad actually enjoyed it a little some of it was too cheezy but it was mostly fun cheezy that wasnt too tired brie is okay her acting really wasnt that bad some complain that she was too wooden or stoic at times which is okayish because it sort of fit the plot ill admit also that i was distracted by the politics and stuff surrounding what seemed like fairly racist or sexist remarks by her recently still i think that despite that i was still able to enjoy her performance she worked well with nick fury cool combo she was basically boring though on her own too idk something is missing but she might be able to improve for the next show   i liked the feminist take on a super hero but alot of the dialogue and direction were wayyyy too on the nose and wound up feeling kind of regressive instead of positive well i am excited to see where this character goes and if they can correct the misteps and capitalize on their successes i could see it going either way though idk if this is just my inferring where i should not because of all of the drama around the movie but i can kind of sense what might be some kulture kamp infused in the movie and its direction some of it is cool and good and timely and refreshing and right and some of it is reactionary and too far and hateful and fueled by resentment and hate possibly its hard to tell which is which they can look similar but i would not write captain marvel off yet she was a fun character that has potential lets see whats done with it
Nov 21 2019,negative,i actually thought people were being to harsh on it but nope its awful
Nov 21 2019,positive,beautiful from start to finish
Nov 21 2019,negative,one of the worst marvel movies
Nov 20 2019,positive,i thought the movie was funny it was funny how they brought in block buster
Nov 20 2019,negative,reallya very awful moviejust wasted my time watching captain marvel
Nov 20 2019,negative,i hated that they squeezed this garbage in between possibly the greatest cliff hanger ever  and the last avengers
Nov 20 2019,negative,worst marvel movie yet please go back to the original formula which was actually good
Nov 19 2019,negative,acting was atrocious and so was the writing
Nov 19 2019,positive,not the kinda movie i rewatch alot it wasnt amazing or great but it was good my main problem with this movie is that the only reason this lady exists is because they wanted two things 1 a funny fight scene in endgame 2 female empowerment they couldve just given us a black widow movie earlier instead of this my full rating of the movie meh you should at least see it once in your life
Nov 19 2019,negative,best thing was the cat
Nov 18 2019,negative,mindnumbingly mediocre which is a worse crime in my book than mere badness the cgi cat was just stupid no shade to the actors they just werent given a very good movie to work with
Nov 17 2019,negative,emotionless performance by larson in yet another marvel origin story blueprint script
Nov 17 2019,positive,its honestly not as good as most marvel movies but not because of any of the sexist reasons most reviewers claim it just isnt quite as sharp not as funny as ant man and less suspenseful than captain america 
Nov 17 2019,positive,this film was great fun now could it be better sure but compared to some of the other marvel movies like age of ultron doctor strange or civil war at least this movie is watchable   carol and her found family are adorable the chemistry between brie and sam is so fun to watch and the action scenes are very enjoyable  its so refreshing the see a woman on screen wear comfortable clothing while she punches people with genuine enthusiasm     if you dont enjoy seeing these more realistic depictions of women in movies then maybe you arent as into women as you think you are
Nov 16 2019,positive,it was awesome i loved the synthisized music
Nov 14 2019,negative,bad acting and bad writing sad
Nov 14 2019,negative,had to watch it several times because i couldnt stay awake even when i would left where i fell a sleep bland performance from brie larson
Nov 14 2019,negative,poor character development stiff acting shoe horned story into the bigger arc
Nov 14 2019,negative,glad i watched this for free on disney  
Nov 14 2019,negative,this movie would be much better without all of the virtue signaling get it together marvel
Nov 14 2019,positive,i saw this movie on premiere night after watching it two more times however much later i now realize i may have walked out of the theater feeling a bit too much hype just for being dealt a decent carol danvers movie this movie seems phenomenal when looked at in reference to dc movies and i love brie larson but this movie isnt that special as a sort of mcu prequel it is very fun for hardcore fans who have managed to keep up with everything and that category of people includes myself but without the rose colored glasses without the integration of this movie via multitudinous references into the mcu this movie has two very mediocre legs upon which to stand  its not a broken movie and there are some very cool cg images so that for me means it registers above the 50 mark i found this movie very memorable as odd as that is to say when most people find it a film that is absolutely not unique from the rest of the superhero mire this movie blends in certainly and i wont give it a high rating just for prodiversity reasons the real reason this movie stands out is that it is a significant change to the original comicbook mythos a stain that for me as a comics reader will always make this movie a bit shinier than others will be capable of seeing it the humor is missing the protagonist is a but dry everything epic feels neutered of true power emotion the besties line is also not driven hard enough i like this movie but it isnt what it should be and compared to its fellow mcu movies its especially underwhelming and if you care about marvel canon this movie takes the skrull and turns them into heroesgoodbye secret invasion storyline
Nov 14 2019,negative,what a waste of movie and the worst casting for a character in marvel and dc history yuge disappointment the o my reason i watched it was because of clues to avengers endgame
Nov 13 2019,negative,captain marvel is super op she is hard to get behind no struggle and no challenge
Nov 12 2019,positive,my favorite marvel movie   watched it 1000 times and wont get tired of it   just love it girls power
Nov 12 2019,neutral,ive discovered more often than not you can tell if a movie will be good from its trailers if a movie was really good chances are it had a good trailer so when i saw all three trailers for captain marvel and was disappointed i didnt have very high hopes and i was absolutely right in my assessment bland music poorly thoughtout feminist pandering and a bland performance by larson plagued the movie to the very end im sure the movie wouldve been much better with another actor playing danvers and i hope to see here replaced soon
Nov 11 2019,negative,lack of character development
Nov 11 2019,positive,emotionallycharged empowering and subversive captain marvel delivered on a number of levels not only as a fun comic book film but as a story about identity and war higher further faster baby
Nov 11 2019,positive,not my favourite in the marvel series but great
Nov 10 2019,neutral,the film is very boring acting at the bottom only secondary characters save the script is bad visual as usual good the plot is very bad better watch another movie dont waste your time
Nov 10 2019,negative,would rate it lower if i could fell asleep watching this movie wouldve been a better movie if it was animated pets
Nov 10 2019,negative,lacking story  nothing inspiring about the hero
Nov 9 2019,negative,one of the poorer marvel movies
Nov 9 2019,negative,i saw a dog doing a crap outside the window while i was watching captain marvel the irony was of the charts
Nov 8 2019,positive,since iron man in 2008 the marvel machine has been churning out hit after hit for years without much as missing a beat 21 freaking movies and the only truly bad one was probably thor 2 the rest are extremely watchable and many of them are very high level movies it is truly an incredible accomplishment what kevin feige and the rest of the marveldisney crew have done i will probably be saying the same thing in a month when endgame comes out    marvel has made it a habit of finding up and coming directors and putting them front and center they did it again this time with anna boden and ryan fleck directing their first major major movie you can tell they put their own spin on a story while still keeping the tone in the marvel mode that is one of the great things about these movies how different yet how similar they all are captain marvel coming right before avengers endgame meant she was going to play a major part in the upcoming events walking into the theater to see that this movie was more or less an origin story was very interesting you learn about the kree skrull war theres a lot of humor throughout and a battle at the end where she learns how to become the hero she always was after a very slow build i was a little worried about this however by the time she gets there i will say it is pretty awesome she really shows that she is probably the most powerful superhero we have seen yet in the mcu    stock watch    stock up  brie larsons stock was very high when she won her best actress oscar for room but it is infinitely higher now she is the first female marvel hero to star in their own movie and she does not disappoint she is powerful charming hilarious and eats up the screen anytime she is on it i walked out saying how much i would love to see her and robert downey jr in a room together soon hopefully    stock down  jude law was so great in the crimes of grindewald as dumbledore that i was excited to see him keep that momentum going maybe because the material was not great he just did not seem fully engaged and i did not buy his character    stock up  ben mendelsohn has become typecast as as a villain in a lot of movies these past few years so i thought his character would be very similar to that in this movie he was a revelation though even behind a ton of makeup he was still very funny and his arc was kind of the emotional beat of the film    stock neutral  samuel l jackson even deaged he is still the man and i just love how he keeps getting them checks    a couple other tidbits     seeing clark gregg back in the movies shoutout agents of shield fans was really fun     all of the 90s references were great and the music choices felt very on point at all times     djimon hounsou always needs a shoutout no matter what he is in    this is just another chink in the marvel machine and should make every fan of these movies extremely excited to see captain marvel show up in a month and fight with the other avengers    juice rating  86100
Nov 8 2019,negative,its such a boring movie its like all the repetitive marvel movies of every year
Nov 7 2019,positive,this film really leans into the marvel formula and feels like an average film brie larson does a good job as captain marvel but the script does not give her a lot to work with ben mendelson and sam jackson are great while jude law is under written and underwhelming captain marvel and the skrulls are good though making me way more excited for inevitable captain marvel 2 than rewatching this film
Nov 7 2019,negative,waste of time i regret watching it
Nov 5 2019,positive,it is fine not as bad as people say but not what i hoped
Nov 5 2019,positive,i like the backstory of capitan marvel
Nov 5 2019,negative,he lost his eye to a cat
Nov 5 2019,positive,the film wasokay i really liked the chemistry between samuel jackson and brie larson but bries characterits like theyre not sure who they want her to be on top of that jude law isnt very memorable the twist i did not see coming with the skrulls nicely done indeed but other than that its justokay okay action okay acting not that memorable otherwise
Nov 5 2019,positive,decent marvel movie i enjoyed this one than most of the others worth a watch
Nov 5 2019,negative,generic action movie you could easily replace the main character with twilight sparkle from my little pony and no one would tell the difference
Nov 4 2019,positive,the movie is good i enjoyed a lot everyone that says that dont like it its lying
Nov 3 2019,positive,despite what some people say about the movie its a great film i really enjoyed it
Nov 3 2019,negative,just trash  the end of ay big marvel movies after endgane
Nov 3 2019,positive,its ok definitely not the best marvel movie but does help slightly understand the last avengers movie a bit
Nov 3 2019,negative,did marvel out sourced this movie
Nov 3 2019,negative,basically its captain garbage
Nov 3 2019,positive,captain marvel  is a good movie sadly people are hating brie larson for something she never said and rating this movie bad without even seen it  this movie has a good story and is much better then the disappointing avengers infinity war and avengers endgame sorry but 1billion heroes doesnt make a movie better
Nov 2 2019,negative,pc in creative hollywood at its finest characters and storyline were abysmal easily the worst of marvels movies would not recommend in any capacity
Nov 2 2019,negative,waste of time obnoxious
Nov 2 2019,negative,its really quite sad how bad this movie is
Nov 2 2019,negative,it was an ok movie but not nearly as good as it was hyped up to be im personally let down they could have made this into something great instead it was just really plain and boring but it passed the time so im not gonna hate on it to much im just really disappointed
Nov 2 2019,negative,to much marry sue and disrespect to nick fury character
Nov 1 2019,negative,a low point in marvel history the soundtrack is one of the poorest ive heard in marvel movies this superhero isnt as intriguing as other marvel superheroes the plot isnt that refreshing more a blockbuster than other thing
Oct 31 2019,positive,warning   spoilers in review    brie larson my second wife  was great i really enjoyed her portayal as danvers powerful and straight badass  goose the cat was good as expected the chemistry between fury and danvers was my favorite combo of the film you could really tell samuel l jackson and brie are buddys in real life the connection was so effortlessly now  my biggest stand out and its a combination of alot of good things into one ben mendelsohn was absolutely great as he is in everything  the skrulls were introduced so well and a particular scene i loved was the chase scene between carol and the skrull as it kept shapeshifting it gave a real creepy terminator t1000 vibe also to mention something ive been wanting marvel to do more of and that is practical special effect makeup and mendelsohn looked absolutely great was over the moon happy with talos  goosebump moment for me in the movie was seeing carols powers at full effect special effects looked awesome minus one scene when shes falling to earth and her powers activate that looked really ruff but when on full display it really hit the point that she will be a juggernaut in the future of the mcu flaws of the movie were some of the fight scenes were good and some just very ruff and cheap camera shots to hide the sloppy choreography also i wanted marvel to take chances with a opening origin film not a safe storyline like i wanted a winter soldier type feel like you dont see coming from a comic film i know a big gripe was them changing marvell into a woman but that didnt bother me at all i absolutely hated the way nick fury lost his eye by goose scratching him rolled my eyes hard when it happened  said to myself please tell me that wasnt it yep it was overall i went in with neutral expectations for a origin film and it was better then i expected honestly i had a really fun time with the film good laughs skrulls were rad one of the best stanlee cameos of alltime and brie larson as carol danverscaptain marvel is such a badass addition to the mcu 
Oct 31 2019,negative,awful worst marvel movie yet
Oct 31 2019,positive,kind of a boring movie other marvel movies are better
Oct 31 2019,negative,boring with a strange story
Oct 29 2019,positive,brie larson looks like captain marvel but she isnt what we should have got shes arrogant about her role and the movie ruined the coolest question what happened to nick furys eye
Oct 29 2019,positive,carols story is inspiring and a bit of dark her story as pilot ends when villains shoot his and cap  marvells down carol gets her powers when engine blows up later they go on a mission and carol gets kidnapped  skrull named talos tries to look her memories but doesnt get what he wants because  carol wakes up then she beats up some skrulls and get away to earth she doesnt know that she is from there because they erased her memory at the end they revealed the real villain yonrogg her teacher carol end up beating him then ronan comes and tries to blow up the earth but carol stops it ronan ends up leaving and movie gets a happy ending movie was good and for marvel a big step to introduce a new leader i hope it gets a sequel with better director
Oct 29 2019,negative,just plain boring
Oct 29 2019,negative,bland and soulless movie
Oct 29 2019,negative,bland like a saltine cracker telling the audience captain marvels backstory while she tries to remember it relieves the possibility for any tension brie larson should be called captain miscast instead
Oct 29 2019,positive,it was fun and enjoyable
Oct 28 2019,negative,probably the weakest marvel movie and its not because of the feminist plot it just was a very boring story
Oct 28 2019,negative,completely average and forgettable and it certainly sucked if it was meant to be a woman empowerment movie captain marvel couldnt compete with men her whole life until she got a fictitious super power point of this story woman cant compete with men on their own merits how stupid is that
Oct 28 2019,negative,borring and week writing 
Oct 28 2019,positive,better then i thought it would be i never read the comics so do not know how the story compares but i was entertained 
Oct 28 2019,negative,i cant believe they turned how fury had his eyepatch into a complete joke disrespectful
Oct 27 2019,negative,bland and boring should have been better brie larson is either horribly miscast or been given bad direction the writing is quite bad too theres no excuse for this flop i would rate it just above thor  the dark world in this day and age when marvel churns classics like iw  gotg1  ragnarok and winter soldier this movie has no place wonder woman was so much better minus the last bit
Oct 27 2019,negative,actor was trying too hard doesnt look genuine should have casted differently unrelateable
Oct 27 2019,negative,awful boring senseless cheap wouldnt waste my time watching it again
Oct 26 2019,negative,the worst of the mavel movies and i am a big fan of marvel 
Oct 26 2019,negative,a brooding boring disinteresting character at least the special effects were good
Oct 25 2019,negative,just saw this dont just pander to me takes me out of the movie 
Oct 25 2019,positive,this was good fun sad they changed the captain marvel character in avengers 
Oct 25 2019,positive,its a good marvel movie and i as a marvel fan liked it brie larson is very well cast although i dont really agree with her standpoints my problems with the film are the storytelling and the main character i know that sounds like big problems but in actuality its okay  so the first point i want to advocate is the storytelling i dont like when a movie gives to much info and tells you what is happening before your eyes that happens a lot here there are a lot of useless questions from characters just to explain things to the audience the problem with vierce aka captain marvel is shes a douche she is just not likable in my opinion she also needs to be buffed shes just to op
Oct 24 2019,positive,i can admit it was underwhelming for a marvel movie brie larson wasnt the strongest lead and some ideas were a little unusual but on its own it was still entertaining and funny
Oct 24 2019,negative,would give it a single star but samuel l jackson is the only saving grace this movie has and it deserves at least given that credit
Oct 24 2019,positive,its good go into it with an open mind a good marvel film
Oct 24 2019,negative,extremely dull how can the protagonist be the most boring character from their own movie
Oct 24 2019,negative,awful from beginning to end acting directing story overall just boring 
Oct 24 2019,negative,the worst of all the mcu movies brie larsson shows how weak she is as an actor just meh 
Oct 24 2019,positive,a pretty good marvel movie though certainly not their best i like to consider this one to be a guardians of the galaxy made into a chick flick brie larson is good as the title character and it was fun to have samuel l jackson really explore the back history of nick fury but the first half and final quarter is pretty much all boring gobbledeegook before all the fun battles happen oh did i forget annette bening nice little turn from her here
Oct 24 2019,positive,i think people who either love or hate this movie are both kidding themselves  lets be honest it was average at best  i think there are people hating it for reasons surrounding the actress and comments she made and the shoehorned nature of bringing this girl power character into the forefront out of nowhere  not to mention she is stupidly overpowered compared to other mcu heroes  that being said most of those complaints have nothing to do with the films quality itself  its not a one star movie  on the other hand the people saying its the best super hero film theyve soon are kidding themselves  too many people wanted this movie to either fail or succeed instead of just seeing it for what it is  a standard super hero flick that ends up being about as average as it could possibly be  
Oct 23 2019,negative,not the best mcu movie
Oct 23 2019,negative,had some barely fun moments but overall its meh   definitely one of the weaker mcu movies down there with thor 2  brie larson even though being a great actress doesnt do well in this movie shes humourless bland and just seems bored  ben mendelsohn is definitely the standout he gives a good performance plays one of the better mcu villains    its not that good 
Oct 23 2019,negative,this is very very meh all over the place and does not fit in the marvel theme i hope she stays in her movie and not containate the rest of the marvel universe in the next series
Oct 23 2019,negative,lacked character developed and a proper storyline 
Oct 23 2019,negative,trash this movie wasnt worth the money it was really predictable and no fun to watch
Oct 23 2019,negative,you need conflict for compelling fiction this has none and a terrible leading actress to boot
Oct 23 2019,positive,this movie had me engrossed and i havent been like that in a while the storyline is excellent with twists and surprises
Oct 22 2019,negative,this movie does more damage to the marvel brand than anything that ive seen so far from the studio it was soulless and the cgi was too far over the top to truly know what you were looking at waste of time and money
Oct 22 2019,negative,terrible movie not worth your time
Oct 22 2019,negative,just dont like the plain and arrogant actress the film is meh the only thing that kinda saved it from being a failure was a connection to the mcu
Oct 22 2019,negative,even without the drama behind the whole of the movie it still isnt a great or even a good movieits just a meh movie the same old marvel as always just a worse version however i can say that i did love ben mendelsohns acting and found that nearly all of the jokes that hit were acted by him though even with that there is so many flaws with this movie it would take too much of my life to write down
Oct 22 2019,negative,worst marvel movie the only marvel movie i really hated
Oct 22 2019,negative,she became the strongest character in one movie   it tool iron man three of his own movies and three avenger movies to be some what as powerful
Oct 22 2019,negative,one of marvels worst films which is saying alot  terrible performances and nonsensical story
Oct 21 2019,positive,i had a good time watching it  i felt larsons performance was a little stale but she will figure it out  other than that it was what i wanted to see for the introduction of captain marvel  
Oct 21 2019,positive,i wanted to really like this movie it just felt like the entire movie people were telling a brick wall to show less emotion if carol showed any less emotion she would have been dead
Oct 21 2019,negative,yet another movie that opts to beat you over the head with identity politics instead of telling a riveting story the addition of space faring and cosmic stories waiting to be unearthed were back on the ground fighting identity batttles in which the war has already been won brie really failed at acting here with her chance to really shine at best she put together a performance not worthy of the local library the real shame here is that brie larson had a really outstanding chance not unlike rdj had with the original iron man to blaze a new path porous acting and laughable delivery of lines robbed this movie
Oct 21 2019,negative,i loved wonderwoman so to say i didnt like this movie just because its a female lead is false 
Oct 21 2019,negative,mediocre nothing newforgettable characterstrying hard to connect it to the mcu
Oct 20 2019,positive,one of the weaker marvel movies and not deserving of such a high rating on here its an alright film but it has a boring protagonist and a forgettable villain
Oct 20 2019,positive,movie afternoon with gertie    marvel goes back to the futurestyle with a welcome and long overdue feminist slant the gags mostly land and the stunts keep pace although the plot takes a while to find its feet    yes theres a scenestealing cat but larson totally dominates this in many ways the film itself doesnt glow in the same way as larson does ultimately captain marvel is enjoyable enough popcorn entertainment larson makes a thoroughly engaging superhero witty courageous and with a sensitivity many others of the marvel stable lack
Oct 20 2019,negative,she really sucks at acting
Oct 20 2019,negative,poorly written and poorly acted theres no character development the plot is terrible the movie relies too heavily on slj and the success of previous marvel movies wonder woman is a much better female driven comic book movie 
Oct 20 2019,negative,generic and formulaic utterly predictable in the most unpleasing way and the only surprise here is how it ruins nick fury 
Oct 20 2019,negative,ok story line probably the one of the two weakest movies in the mcu universe alongside thor  the dark world what really made this movie unwatchable was the way the main character was written and the actresss portrayal of said character the character seemed to be intentionally written to be unlikable and arrogant unlike any of the mcu heroes and larsons facial expression was bland and unchanging throughout the film
Oct 20 2019,negative,definitely not marvels best but if your a big fan you will still enjoy it good characters outside of brie larson carry the movie
Oct 20 2019,negative,not bad for a movie but for the people who grew up reading the comics this is not captain marvel this is a constant pmsing selfish chick she doesnt show any of the values captain marvel had like being a overly good boy scout its like she didnt do any research on the caricature 
Oct 19 2019,neutral,the good  the kree world was very interesting and i wish i saw more of it  performances were great all around especially ben mendelsohn  the plot twist of the skrulls just wanting a home and not wanting to end the kree caught me off guard and i was very surprised to say the least  the humor was on point  f    goose the     the bad  character development was practically nonexistent midway through the movie lashana lynch gives carol an emotional conversation but it doesnt work because both characters are severely underdeveloped  the pacing was all over the place  the mcu continuity was kinda thrown out the window  the cgi mostly good looked very fake and noticeable in the third act
Oct 19 2019,negative,main character with no skills of acting same faces same reactions same stupidity bad movie the cat scene was the best part please
Oct 19 2019,negative,predictable surprisingly lame action choreography and very very hamfisted ideas the only good thing in it was samuel l jackson captain marvel seems like a very unpleasant person to be around
Oct 19 2019,positive,i thought it was pretty good
Oct 19 2019,negative,the story is weak the acting is ok at best there is no tension and i didnt care about any of the characters there were a couple cute scenes but in general the movie lacked energy this is the worst marvel film to date
Oct 19 2019,negative,inconsistancies make it hard to get into and woke message makes it even more painful
Oct 19 2019,negative,trash movie complete trash beyond words
Oct 19 2019,negative,not worth watching movie at all there wasnt any attachment to main character her cocky attitude was too much everything was going so smooth its like there wasnt any challenge at all utterly disappointment and captain marvel for sure is the most hated character how can you like a movie when you dont even like the main character itself i hope they dont make part 2
Oct 19 2019,negative,worst of the mcu movies
Oct 18 2019,negative,is a waste of time not recommended 
Oct 18 2019,negative,crap weakest of all the mcu movies
Oct 18 2019,negative,this movie is dissapointing since stan lee face is appear in the company logo i hope stan deserve better movie than this
Oct 18 2019,negative,very boring movie terrible acting or lack of from brie larson theres been enough super hero movies out we expect more marvel usually does well but they went all in on a terrible story and writing and decided to put in an actress that couldnt act you can miss this movie and it wouldnt affect anything in the mcu 
Oct 18 2019,positive,it was ok but not great
Oct 18 2019,positive,captain marvel is fun while being underwhelming samuelljackson is great with brie larson and ben mendelssohn is a good villain captain marvel feels to overpowered and confusing at times
Oct 18 2019,positive,i like it very much i love brie larson as captain marvel aka carol danvers
Oct 18 2019,negative,very bland and boring no plot build up characters were weak too linear 110 will not see again
Oct 17 2019,negative,so a woman behaves like a stereotypical man and she believes that this somehow empowers women also awful acting and poor writing
Oct 17 2019,negative,lacking the likeable substance that nearly every other mcu hero has captain marvel falls flat in attempting to deliver an entertaining experience instead feeling like a shell of what it could be
Oct 17 2019,negative,it was boring and repetitive  the main character doesnt have any character building  she just is awesome and has been and always will be  there is no growth  no aspirations  it just feels like she herself is reacting to a comic book only mildly smiling at times  i hope she gets better character development in future movies 
Oct 17 2019,negative,lackluster and boring everything a superhero movie shouldnt be
Oct 17 2019,positive,actually a very entertaining movie  larson did a good job as an amnesiac who has been conditioned to be an unemotional kree soldier  she didnt even begin to recover until near the end and while she got some memories back she didnt get the emotions associated with them back  in the comics carol became binary basically phoenixlight before eventually losing most of the cosmic powers and becoming a more earthly captain marvel  marvel did a good job adapting all that crazy history into a 2 hour film
Oct 16 2019,negative,bad acting captain same jaded face
Oct 16 2019,neutral,the movie is visually good and has good cgi but you never really connect with captain marvel making a cat more interesting yes i know how it sounds
Oct 16 2019,negative,i never disliked a single character of the mcu and  then captain marvel came along
Oct 15 2019,negative,boring movie really overhyped with uncharismatic performances and very dull characters with no personality 
Oct 15 2019,negative,worst movie marvel has made yet makes me reconsider watching marvel movies in the future
Oct 14 2019,positive,not the best marvel film in the mcu but still a good film 
Oct 14 2019,positive,i dont think this movie deserves some of the derision its come to be associated with i thought it was fun and lighthearted the way the antman movies are brie larson and samuel l jackson had surprising chemistry and i think the only mistake was making her too overpowered this is evident when they had to bench her for most of avengers endgame because she couldve solved most of the avengers problems with the powers she has i do hope they make a sequel because i actually liked this character
Oct 14 2019,negative,hard to get into a movie for a superhero that seems invincible  needs to have a weakness  acting was serviceable but storyline was slow and predictable  wonder woman was a lot better
Oct 14 2019,positive,so good cant believe the audience score the main character is cool and likeable the action is awesome and the story had an awesome twist that i loved worth a watch or two and i cant wait for the sequel
Oct 14 2019,negative,boring and lacked an interesting story pretty sure any fan fiction about captain marvel is more worthwhile
Oct 14 2019,negative,it was a good nick fury origin story thats really it
Oct 14 2019,negative,lacking any real plot or direction  one of the worst so far in the marvel releases
Oct 14 2019,negative,same old predictable slow story just watch irion man 1
Oct 13 2019,negative,ill describe this movie in four words pathetic waste of time
Oct 13 2019,negative,liberals need to stop letting their beliefs get in the way of their artistic values this is not how films should be made
Oct 13 2019,negative,i didnt like how the male human beings were portrayed as being nasty and repulsive as a whole women and men suffer the same things in their everyday lifes i didnt felt the character had a challenge it was like the development of her never came she is an overpowered hero and that power is never justified
Oct 13 2019,negative,crappy movie with too much politically correct garbage to enjoy
Oct 13 2019,negative,                                 fans consensus      an ok story with action passible humor and visuals that      most mcu fans are probably familiar with captain marvel      introduces its first hero that shows what the series is     going to be like in phase 5 and its not good at all   
Oct 13 2019,positive,funny powerful and amazing by far the one of the best movies on marvels franchise 
Oct 13 2019,negative,what a bad moviefelt like watching a bad made for lifetime channel superhero movie with mediocre cgi brie larson complete miscastkatee sackhoff or katherine winnick would have been 1000x better wtf is with skrulls being the universes dreamersben mendleson great as usual but we have another overpowered disney mary sueblah
Oct 13 2019,negative,worst mcu movie in my opinion   
Oct 13 2019,positive,solid job by brie larson enjoyable superhero origin film really liked samuel l jackson de aged he was fun to watch acting as a younger version of himself priceless stuff it was nice chemistry between the two of them throughout strongest part of the film and her backstory i enjoyed as well with her air force counterpart played by lashana lynch i adored her interaction at the beginning of the 3rd act with her friends daughter and her picking out the uniforms color aesthetic i had some visual effect minor qibbles and at times uneven story telling still i really appreciated here overall character arc seems to me that the new face of the mcu has a worthy next chapter to be excited about
Oct 13 2019,positive,i think i expected more from captain marvel and maybe thats feeding the patriarchy its trying to fight to expect more from a woman than you do a man i guess i felt brie larson was a little stiff and lacked the comic timing needed for a marvel superhero but marvel origins do tend to be a lot of foundation work and that takes time away from the fun that marvel is famous to be fair most jokes revolved around 90s references and were more corny than what weve come to expect from marvel i am looking forward to captain marvel returning and enjoyed getting more back story on the kree i loved the friendship between carol and lashana lynchs maria rambeau  it felt very real the special effects were on point  especially fascinating was the deaging done on samuel l jacksons fury etc   also note the only reviewers that have a problem with the feminist agenda are men 
Oct 12 2019,negative,firstly didnt like brie larsons acting  secondly tho whole movie is trash
Oct 12 2019,negative,absolutely dull and terrible
Oct 12 2019,negative,15 stars thats all earned by samuel 
Oct 12 2019,negative,a really bland and boring movie and is a huge disgrace to the mcu
Oct 12 2019,neutral,it killed time it definitely was a treat for longtime mcu fans such as myself to see young nick fury played perfectly once again by samuel but the lacklustre plot and sloppy writing bogs this show down so bad that it was no substance and to top it all off captain marvel has no character shes just basic superhero number one why do you think man of steel felt so boring it was just the same story again and captain marvel made a lot of the same mistakes so my overall opinion of this movie is it adds nothing to the mcu you can easily skim by without watching this movie
Oct 11 2019,negative,god it was so boring and brie larson was the worst at acting literally the only marvel movie i dont like when i buy the 23movie box set ill just toss this one in the trash and watch all the other ones
Oct 11 2019,negative,i couldnt even finish this flat acting and a banal plot with special effects that dont help if this is the direction the mcu is going i fear the worst for the next phase
Oct 11 2019,negative,superhero movies are meant to leave you inspired cant say that i felt that way here tonally everything felt off dont think the casting paid off perhaps
Oct 11 2019,negative,a movie that takes you to nothing without an interesting climax bad villain bad attempt at feminism especially the scene where he says  i must not prove anything to anyone  simply a burdian tape is the same or worse than ironman 3
Oct 11 2019,negative,what let this down for me was having a protagonist thats hard to empathise with thanks to a deficit of personality cpt marvel is somewhat misanthropic like early iron man but where he was entertainingly cynical and witty cpt marvel just comes across as entitled and selfabsorbed eventually always able to get her own way thanks to having infinite superpowers
Oct 11 2019,negative,superhero genre isnt about sexism the rule is simple go woke get broke
Oct 11 2019,negative,probably the weakest movie that has come out of the mcu thus far action and effects were good story was alright main character was poorly written with zero growth emotion or story and the acting only built up on the negative aspects above rather than elevating it     this movie is bad as a standalone and absolutely should not exist as part of the mcu as its a massive net detriment to everything it comes into contact with if this movie had one success it was to have the audience have more emotional attachment to thanos than to captain marvel 
Oct 10 2019,neutral,a decent origin story with an uninteresting main character and a third act full of bad cgi captain marvel fails to generate the same emotion as the last installments of the mcu perhaps due to the fact that in its attempt to slowly introduce us to the characters it ends up being a little bit boring
Oct 10 2019,negative,horrible acting terrible writing subpar action all unusual cause brie l can do better last frustration is the explanation of how nick fury lost his eye why tho
Oct 10 2019,negative,its the worst thing a movie can be boring
Oct 10 2019,negative,this movie was just bad  lacked any emotions  
Oct 10 2019,negative,completely ruined the character of nick fury for me boring flat character ham fisted messages not for me
Oct 10 2019,positive,im not the sjw type but i liked captain marvels movie    the negative ratings were not because of the movie itself nor the characters it was because of actress brie larson and her interviews    i just found out why when i asked my brazilian friends about the movie they liked it and didnt mention the lead actress    i dont like gossip so i generally dont like to see the personal lives of actors    i only found out about brie larsons controversial interviews talking to americans    people dont hate captain marvel or carol danvers they hate brie larson    too bad she exaggerated in some of the interviews because the movie was very good    i sincerely hope you have a sequel to captain marvel
Oct 10 2019,negative,watched it only for the catthat was the only interesting and entertaining part
Oct 10 2019,negative,wanted to like this movie but it was boring  the plot was weak and the humor felt forced
Oct 10 2019,negative,movie felt forced and brie larson is weak as carol danvers
Oct 10 2019,negative,too much political stuff i just came for the action only action was near the end
Oct 9 2019,negative,not what i expected very boring movie for me unfortunately
Oct 9 2019,negative,did not finish watching it 15 mins were more than enough to make me quit this movie glad i didnt waste my money going to the cinema on this horrible attemp of movie  how does it have more score on the critics than in the audience  
Oct 9 2019,negative,does anybody remember the 90s    i guess were just gonna have to take james gunns word for it when he said captain marvel is the most powerful mcu hero because thats not what i saw here or in endgame as a standalone movie this is fine just fine thats it in the mcu it feels like a piece of jigsaw puzzle that someone is trying to force into place where it clearly does not fit 
Oct 9 2019,negative,as an origin story its bleh the character needs some work no emotion at all the scene where she steals the guys clothes because he hits on her was ridiculous im not the target audience why is the majority of comic book readers white males oh because we are the target audience we spend our money on what we like stop messing it up disney 
Oct 9 2019,positive,somewhat mediocre plot and terrible acting great soundtrack though
Oct 9 2019,negative,was the worst marvel movie 
Oct 9 2019,negative,samuel l jackson is awesome but brie larson is just unlikeable in this role its as if they told her to have the cocky ness if tony stark but with none of the charisma
Oct 9 2019,negative,samual l jackson was as good as always but its a forgettable entry into the mcu
Oct 9 2019,negative,its hard to watch all the way to the end as i have a broom with more depth of character and a more natural presence  i see why this film was held up by the 2 marvel films either side of its release at least i know i can save my money on any sequels truly awful  who ever write this character is either incompetent or the actress is awful i think its a bit of both
Oct 9 2019,negative,neither this movie have any plot or character except the only thing highlighted at look at me i am a woman
Oct 9 2019,negative,not my favorite marvel movie i see whats going on here and the fans dont like it disney needs to do better before dc eclipses them
Oct 9 2019,negative,stupid shithole movienothing new here just another marvel movie with same boring marvel formula
Oct 9 2019,negative,awful just awful im done with marvel movies
Oct 9 2019,positive,what can you say for this movie is just another good mcu  movie
Oct 8 2019,negative,the movie was just meh i like brie larson so im willing to accept that she was directed to act a certain way but the whole thing for me was forgettable 
Oct 8 2019,negative,stiff performance by larson not a great performance as other female superheroes like gadot
Oct 8 2019,negative,another generic superhero movie with s bad script score cg dont recommend 
Oct 8 2019,neutral,way too much feminism
Oct 8 2019,negative,waited to watch for only 399 and it wasnt even worth that  brie larson is a bad actress no emotion or depth  the scroll costumes were so bad  come on disney with your budget this was a garbage movie
Oct 8 2019,negative, it worth the price of admission 
Oct 8 2019,positive,adrenaline possiblity excitement  goosebumps  captain marvel kicks a  
Oct 8 2019,negative,captain marvel was a bland boring protaginist
Oct 8 2019,negative,  its the loosest movie ive seen without any emotion pure effects and a hollow story
Oct 8 2019,negative,could have had better cast 
Oct 8 2019,negative,boring and forgettable larson  disney makes me rethink about go and watch new releases of mcu movies if i could give less stars i would
Oct 8 2019,negative,another marvel movie how doesnt change the wheel its a messy movie with a boring main performance thanks to brie larson she is written more like a villian but for some reason the movie make us clear everytime she is strong and independient heroine 
Oct 8 2019,negative,a movie probably nobody asked for scarlett johanssons black widow should have had the first female standalone movie in the mcu instead of this brie larsons acting is like watching a dead fish nice visuals but nothing extraordinary wasted opportunity
Oct 8 2019,positive,bots are basic this movie is an origin story done right and brie larson is my captain marvel
Oct 7 2019,positive,it was decent but a bit disappointing compared to other mcu movies action sequences and skrulls were major highlights
Oct 7 2019,negative,had to stop myself from falling asleep in this one really didnt enjoy it at all worst marvel movie to date 
Oct 7 2019,negative,i wouldnt call this a bad movie but with the mcu reputation this movie was disappointing compared to dcs wonder woman movie which has its issues to it wasnt the best that was offered  captain marvel as a character didnt face any real challenges to challenge her powers and her ability to thinkby the way the fight with yonrogg was disappointing to see because cpt marvel didnt show emotion but he did and he was all about controlling emotion and her character arc was about showing emotion
Oct 7 2019,positive,well is very good the prequel before infinity war and the future endgame but there scenes a bit boring the final battle is good and the postcredits scene is fantastic meaning that the real final battle is coming i say good movie but the scenes they have to improve
Oct 7 2019,positive,standard marvel fare nothing special
Oct 6 2019,neutral,theyre all the same 
Oct 6 2019,negative,acting and story is just popcorn fluff cgi was goofy many parts of film very boring aimed audience must be 12 year old girls looking for empowerment
Oct 6 2019,positive,as origin stories go i liked it im looking forward to see where they go from here
Oct 6 2019,negative,am not allow ancestors cry 
Oct 6 2019,negative,brie larson ruined this movie her acting is so blah she has the emotional depth of an overcooked french fry 
Oct 6 2019,negative,unfortunately its the most boring and underwhelming marvel movie i really tried to like the humorless and boring character whom experiences zero growth throughout the movie 
Oct 6 2019,negative,sucked brie larson was a good choice but the movie lacked so much it will be a waste of time to go into further detail  end credits were great though  cool glimpse of endgame 
Oct 6 2019,positive,march 2019 whats with all the hate i thought it was decent
Oct 6 2019,negative,meh at best  utterly formulaic which is nothing new to marvel but somehow manages to be dulling missable if you are thinking you need to watch this in order to make sense of the later marvel film fear not you get everything  need to know from the main series shame i wanted this move to be great but it just wasnt  
Oct 6 2019,negative,boring story and boring performance by brie larson only good thing about this movie are a couple of special effects
Oct 6 2019,positive,disappointing for an mcu film yet still has a lot of fun but its main character was just very underdeveloped b
Oct 6 2019,positive,i thought it was a good movie it was definitely not the best mcu movie though i thought it was a good amount of actionpacked  some say this was a bad mcu movie but i disagree it does deserve dome credit brie larson definitely does
Oct 6 2019,negative,the story is good but the casting decision is very poor
Oct 6 2019,negative,movie is the worst in the franchise its boring and has no life it feels very forced she is the superman of the mcu with the best and most powerful abilitys no one likes a superman the point of all the heros in the mcu is they are all flawed but she isnt she is the colour grayboring and plain
Oct 6 2019,positive,good humor and good action as expected of marvel some of the american imperialist overtones of saving the refugees were overdramatic and considering what was happening during the release not entirely accurate 
Oct 6 2019,negative,terrible one of the worst movies i have ever seen 
Oct 6 2019,negative,i have to place full blame on the directors and the writer on this one a good mcu film should match the tone of other mcu films its like the film makers had never seen one before sam jackson is great for what he got which was unfortunately a neutered nick fury brie larson is a great actress but her role darted from heroic to unnecessarily mean you cant fault someone if the ink and paper are lacking and the direction is poor    the story breaks a bunch of continuity and this includes the two worst moments in the entire run of the mcu how nick loses his eye and a terrible cg goose stuck against the wall is this captain marfield a tale of two kitties so tone deaf that you think your audience is four year olds just embarrassing    this is the first film of the series i will not be purchasing as i dont ever need to see it again such a shame so much talent wasted because of total zeroes at the top i guess feige doesnt have as much influence as thought because this is nothing like his fantastic past output i dont know how the team snowed him on this movie working terrible is being kind
Oct 6 2019,negative,poorly constructed heroine with lack of emotion and character when the best character in a movie is a cat then you have a problem
Oct 5 2019,negative,absolute feminist pandering garbage  save your time  you cant get it back
Oct 5 2019,negative,while i dont think the movie was terrible i was very disappointed bland directing generic story and a surprisingly very poor performance by brie larson was expecting more from marvel 410
Oct 5 2019,negative,ugh an annoying movie with hints of awesomeness
Oct 5 2019,negative,this movie was exceedingly bland it was just so plain and simple brie larson is ok the script is average and the movie suffers from an awful underdeveloped villain
Oct 5 2019,negative,i didnt think that disappointment could be this bad go watch wonder woman and avoid this trash
Oct 5 2019,positive,truly amazing girl power movie  my 8 yo daughter and i loved it  new fav super hero
Oct 5 2019,positive,does it work the short answer is yes theres enough to keep both diehard marvel fans and newcomers engaged
Oct 5 2019,positive,an ok middleoftheroad mcu movie
Oct 5 2019,positive,good story great characters carol danvers is pretty uninspiring though but that may not be brie larsons fault entirely
Oct 5 2019,positive,this is my wifes favorite marvel movie we saw it several times in the theater together i liked the set  sound design when the star force invaded the planet at the beginning of the movie  again around the friends house in the middle of the movie the deaging of fury was great my favorite characters were played by ben mendelssohn  annette benning 
Oct 5 2019,negative,brie larson plays captain marvel like a robot
Oct 4 2019,negative,this movie is so boring
Oct 4 2019,negative,boring by the numbers superhero movie with nonsensical plot and wooden acting
Oct 4 2019,neutral,standard mcu letdown 
Oct 4 2019,negative,i was very dissatisfied with this movie wish i didnt waste my money on it
Oct 4 2019,negative,after 10 years of triumphs and falls by a studio that seemed to know what it was doing captain marvel is a waste of time that brings nothing but confusion to the movie universe that has been built upon brie larson is a n okay casting and does deliver a solid performance but in a movie filled with bad jokes cheap explanations and a whole lot of tomfoolery you cant make a bad movie better by adding an okay actress
Oct 4 2019,negative,plot holes everywhere character was boring  two dimensional and never felt a connection with carol writers and director decided to focus more on making a powerful female character rather than to focus on the plot which they succeeded would rather wait for a black widow or scarlet witch movie
Oct 4 2019,negative,worst movie of mcu the protagonist is very forced and without charisma the only good part of this movie is the performance of samuel l jackson and ben mendelsohn
Oct 4 2019,negative,impressionless boring filmone of the worst film from mcu
Oct 4 2019,negative,the only reason this movie made big bucks was because of being the prelude to endgame plot was loose and really boring the writers made no effort to develop a really interesting story for captain marvel     they tried to empower women but they failed in my opinion they showed us a badass heroine since the beginning till the end no character development for carol and showing us she being kind of cocky and a showoff due to her ultimate limitless power brie larson performance didnt help at all i think any other actress couldve done the same or better she acted the whole movie like she was reading a speech or from the teleprompter     also the way they took down other characters in her favor nick fury was nosense it was the 90s and fury was acting like he just joined the forces with no spy experience whatsoever they wasted the skrulls as villains in a plot twist extremely dumm and unnecessary with jokes very flat and unfunny and incorrect timing for them    in my opinion you can tell the movie was very influentiated by the fact of having 2 directors which is not always bad but in this case it was they didnt follow the marvel way and they paid the price not economically since it passed the billion but in storytelling i understand they make these movies for children as well and we wont be able to to see movies like winter soldier or infinity war very often but damn they didnt commit at all with this movie
Oct 4 2019,positive,brie larson is perfect as the female hero and steals the show the storyline is convoluted but the visual effects and actionpacked sequences make this movie to be loveable by all marvel diehard fans
Oct 4 2019,negative,the worst marvel movie to date the acting of the woman that plays captain marvel was just not believable and some of the lines were downright cringe worthy if i didnt want to miss the tieins to the avengers movies i would have turned it off halfway through
Oct 4 2019,positive,good movie dont like brie larsen but enjoyed the movie 
Oct 4 2019,negative,this movie is a cringy joke 
Oct 3 2019,negative,so much  potential instead horrible cgi and the story fails to get your attention 
Oct 3 2019,negative,boring the plot made no sense and the effects looked like garbage
Oct 3 2019,neutral,the critics consensus is good just because of the suroundings about the movie and the innovations of being a female star character the movie is actually not that good
Oct 3 2019,negative,finally saw it wish i hadnt 
Oct 3 2019,negative,just not a good movie at all 
Oct 3 2019,positive,very funny movie good action sequences nice story   love the cat love brie role love samuel jackson parts 
Oct 2 2019,negative,the plot holes were deeper than most of the characters     a powerful character does not make a strong character a character who face no realistic stakes and whose only limiter was a small pin she could disable at any time if a competent villain has the ability to restrict those powers why would he allow her to remove said limiter why would he even let her know it was there    the choice of playing just a girl makes it hard to ignore any potential political messages this movie has thrown at the audience this far given how mediocre i felt the rest of the movie to have been it seems that the message behind the moive was more important to the writers than the actual storydriven plot 
Oct 2 2019,positive,brie larson is an amazing actress and in the movie you can see feminist movements but not being over the top and making it the central focus of the movie but also a theme in it
Oct 1 2019,negative,the movie was boring and i was disappointed in all the clout they gave her
Oct 1 2019,negative,this move is inaccurate and the brie larson cant act to save her life how the woman got an oscar we will never know
Oct 1 2019,negative,non actor not good story everything is boor  mcu boooooooooooo
Sep 30 2019,negative,i have been a big fan of the marvel movies since iron man  i have always looked forward to each new movie when they are released   but captain marvel was a movie that just didnt seem to have any purpose almost a money grab between infinity wars and end game      the main difference between this movie and all the others  the main hero has no likable personality at all i found myself rooting for the villains half way through the movie   i seriously couldnt care any less for this character or whatever the issue was for her  she comes off as a know it all  pompous elite hero and that attitude doesnt change by the end of the movie  not like thor who grew as a character by the end of his first movie  she has the same attitude after the credits role          
Sep 30 2019,positive,brie larson samuel l jackson and ben mendelsohn are great visuals are beautiful and is one of the most creative and fun marvel origin stories that we have seen in a while
Sep 30 2019,negative,it is a cringe spectacle from the horrible miscasting of ms larson to the ridiculus action scenes i am happy i didnt pay for the movie at the theather and waited this long to watch it critics have lost their minds if they think this is a good movie
Sep 29 2019,negative,when i went to watch the captain marvel movie in the theatre i was convinced i was going to hate it but i wanted to give it every chance i possibly could and separate my preconceptions from my thought while viewing  at the end of the day i one thing to say about the movie meh  the action and visuals were alright to went and the comedy halfway funny but brie larsons performance as captain marvel was so heartless and monotone that made it impossible to relate with and the movie suffered as a consequence
Sep 29 2019,positive,one of my favorite movies of the last few years loved the humor and backstory revelations better than endgame which had a slow drawn out first half  one of my top 6 superhero movies along with the 1st guardians movie wonder woman and all 3 captain america movies
Sep 29 2019,negative,no substance marysue superhero genuinely unlikeable
Sep 29 2019,negative,keep your identity politics out of comic book movies not buying what youre selling
Sep 29 2019,positive,yall need to stop hating the movie was good get over your testosterones 
Sep 29 2019,positive,i love what this movie represents  on the surface its a feminists dream but the deeper coe is that captain marvel is the strongest because of her humanity  
Sep 29 2019,positive,not the usual origin story  but one that weaves a little more deception and humor into the mix  
Sep 28 2019,positive,very funny pacing was done well and the arc was amazing absolutely loved it
Sep 28 2019,positive,a middling entry in marvels cinematic universe enjoyable enough to rewatch and a pleasant revisitation in an mcu marathon
Sep 28 2019,negative,this review will be taken down in 24hrs because it is misogynistic racist and offensive just like the tens of thousands of other negative reviews on this movie that magically disappeared overnight 
Sep 28 2019,negative,the 2nd worst marvel movie outside of thor dark worlds slow boring and a very u likable lead for the movie
Sep 28 2019,negative,captain marvel is portrayed as a one dimensional character with little heart or passion does little to support any sort of real feminist virtues as it just is skin deep corporate attempt to cash in poor storyline a real airforce pilot would be much smarter and better trained all in all a real disapointment
Sep 27 2019,positive,idk why this is not a liked film brie larson gives a fantastic performance and due to its womans day release it delivers everything an mcu movie does also a show stopper has to be the charm of samuel l jackson
Sep 27 2019,negative,i expected more with such great things said to me about it 
Sep 27 2019,negative,terrible writing if only larsons character had a personality and had at least some weaknesschallenge to overcome as it stands she was just too marvellous to be relatable
Sep 27 2019,negative,bland characters poor performance by brie larson weak villian no character development this is by far the worst marvel movie yet
Sep 26 2019,negative,got bored from the beginning to end
Sep 26 2019,negative,this movie was awful
Sep 26 2019,negative,stupid plot and tired of the leftist agenda showcased in it
Sep 26 2019,negative,mediocre at best brie larsons captain marvel shows no emotion throughout the movie with a slight auror of cockiness not the superhero i was expecting after learning about her from the comics disappointing best describes it  
Sep 26 2019,negative,i thought a second look would help it didnt i was more bored the second time brie larson seems like the knowitall teachers pet that the teacher didnt like
Sep 25 2019,neutral,entertaining enough but the best parts came from other characters if the writers were less obviously trying to forcefeed certain ideologies down your throat maybe this one wouldve had more heart and appreciation from the fans stop forcefeeding us your views dont preach to us give us a good story
Sep 24 2019,negative,this is the worst mcu movie ever the character development is terrible the movie is just boring the dialogue is poorly written and this movie seemed rushed 
Sep 24 2019,positive,its not as bad as people seem to say it is i liked a couple of things about it the story was great i dont think they forced the female superhero too much brie larson did in her interviews but the movie wasnt too woke i thought it was pretty clever at times and it offers a decently good explanation of furys missing eye dont trust cats yall
Sep 24 2019,negative,this movie should not be classified as entertaiment
Sep 24 2019,positive,good opening for the new lead for the mcu larson is very subtle in her performance which may seem wooden to some
Sep 24 2019,negative,something was odd about this character and the performance she is too powerful and the origin story a bit off
Sep 24 2019,negative,incredibly boring  superman can get away with being too powerful because he 1 has several weaknesses that are exploited and 2 he has a personality  captain marvel offers a few quips but it feels awkward because the rest of the movie has her lacking any personality whatsoever  the movie highlights this as most every other character seems to admonish her to control her emotions in the middle of her expressing zero emotions  no stakes simple plot and little to redeem it
Sep 23 2019,negative,instead of worrying about a political agenda they should have been worried about making a better script and performance captain marvel is a forgettable character the villains are depressing and the supporting characters are not relevant and are unserious
Sep 23 2019,positive,funny and powerful with just enough serious substance the movie has hot the core of the 90s comics
Sep 23 2019,negative,this was not good she is very unlikeable i wont invest into any more of these movies   
Sep 23 2019,negative,good moive to rebook with different actor
Sep 23 2019,negative,an insulting movie that undermines the rest of the entire mcu by suddenly introducing a dues ex machina character who has the powers of every other character thus making every struggle that ever happened pointless and unneeded her arrival also suddenly inserts numerous plotholes into the overall story arch that didnt previously exist 
Sep 23 2019,neutral,plot was lame and tge villains didnt live up to the marvel universe about as good of a story as ant man without the humor
Sep 23 2019,negative,me being an avid comic book fan i thought that this movie was both pointless and random at the same time seeing as how we all know who captain marvel is because of this movie alone brie larsons time in avengers endgame was cut short and i was really expecting to see her character more this is quintessentially one of the worst marvel movies enjoyable but pointless
Sep 23 2019,negative,no charisma in the moviewhos going to lead the mcu after rdj youll basically use your phone during this moviewas boring and thats a first for a marvel movie
Sep 23 2019,negative,what a pos of a movie
Sep 23 2019,negative,i only watched this movie in theaters since i wanted to see if this movie tied into the infinity war part 2 movie it didnt and you can total skip this movie because it is a stand alone movie that doesnt tie into the current timeline at that time and so you can skip this movie but she is barely in the infinity war part 2 movie but its a good sunday super hero movie to watch if you are all caught up with both the dc and marvel movie universes
Sep 22 2019,negative,believe me im not a troll its just a very badboring movie
Sep 22 2019,negative,terrible preachy unconvincing firstonly so far boring forgettable mcu film
Sep 22 2019,negative,yikes i waited until this was on dvd and i could get it for free at family video i felt like i wasted a good coupon the good thing to happen in this movie was the fight scene to no doubt which was fitting and that i bought a metal popcorn tin from my local theater when avengers end game came out we use captain marvel to hold our bathroom trash 
Sep 21 2019,positive,great performances all around samuel l jackson steels the show their just wasnt enough to get me interested during the film
Sep 21 2019,negative,bland story carol danvers is a mary sue
Sep 21 2019,negative,worst movie in franchise forgetable and contributes nothing to the mcu storey
Sep 20 2019,negative,it just boring and inferior to other mcu movies
Sep 20 2019,negative,i was bored to sleep to the end
Sep 20 2019,negative,a lot of cringey jokes this movie is terrible dont waste your money
Sep 20 2019,negative,way too polarizied with identity politics if i want political statements this thick or heavy i would be watching the news bree larson was probably the worst choice for this role possible too bland and underwhelming
Sep 20 2019,negative,tedious boring unlikable main character with all the charisma of a rotten cabbage manages to ruin the backstory of a major character for a stupid joke plot makes no sense 
Sep 20 2019,neutral,action and special effects are 5 stars dialog and character development are less than one what really brought it down was the quick cuts the dialog was speeded up till it seemed like a kids cartoon just not the way real people have conversations 
Sep 20 2019,negative,very poor main character too sassy not charismatic at all doesnt have emotional or character growth she just gets strongerstrength alone isnt interesting
Sep 20 2019,negative,what can i say  it was dull humorless and didnt fit well with the rest of the mcu  if it had been a stand alone film and not tried to be shoehorned into the mcu it may have stood a little better but overall it had poor writing the effects were below what would be expected from marvel and the heros journey completely nonexistent
Sep 20 2019,negative,was ok felt like they quickly whipped up this movie to cram it in just before end game lead actress dosnt have much range
Sep 19 2019,negative,not an admirable superhero
Sep 19 2019,negative,really bad adaptation of the character rushed movie through and through could of been much better but main characters was standoffish and lacking emotional depth no real urgency to hope and cheer a hero who always seems more omnipotent than thanos with the gauntlet
Sep 19 2019,negative,i wouldnt say its a horrible movie but its definitely the worst in the mcu the main character didnt see any character progression throughout the entire movie except a powerup they set up a good lesson for her in not to let your feelings get the best of you but instead of her learning something she was right all the time
Sep 19 2019,negative,the plot seemed so bleakthe arc of carol danvers remains the same throughout the whole moviethere is no emotional substanceshe starts and remains the same person throughout the whole moviethere is no emotional closure or a catalyst for her to learn throughout the moviefor example iron man started as a prick and a war monger at the beginning of iron man but going through the events in the movie he understood what his actions and invention did to the people that he never knew existed on the opposite side of the worldthe only arc of  carol danver was that of her memory and her missing pastbut guess what it did do anything at the end of the movieit didnt change herit didnt insert new perspective on the main characterit just didnt doi had higher expectation for marvels first solo female character film but in the end people were rightblack widow should have been the first female solo marvel filmeven with her less screen time in other marvel films she makes an compelling characterher arc in other movies is way better than this entire filmand the cgi in this movie is omphhhhpeople even with no visual impairment will think about going for a check upall in allthe film is badly editedthe editing cuts sometimes make it even harder to follow the character or know whats happening in the screenthe fights are even harder to make sense off on the end noteeverything about this movie could have been better but i guess it wasnt fated to be
Sep 19 2019,neutral,it was a very passable marvel movie fun enough when you look at it by itself without any context from other marvel movies but really doesnt tie into the whole universe other than setting up one character for endgame     the music was nice the plot was basically a generic superhero origin story girl gets random power from random object from a random alien race the amnesia aspect has also been done before wolverine especially    again the movie was fun enough but wasnt really a movie worth rewatching or remembering 
Sep 19 2019,negative,boring shes not a leader but a follower in this movie
Sep 18 2019,negative,its never fun when you know whats going to happen before it happens
Sep 18 2019,negative,a slug to sit through with no personality to speak of
Sep 18 2019,neutral,this movie is not bad nor good even if the main actress lacks the personality to portray the main hero in my opinion i didnt enjoy her performance ah they dont or maybe they choose not to mention captain marvels nickname but its just a detail
Sep 18 2019,negative,ive seen better performances from planks of wood  movie was fine but thats all it was fine  it wasnt easy to relate to since the character is overwhelmingly powerful from the very gate not giving people a character to root for  010 wont see again
Sep 18 2019,negative,this movie completely missed the mark instead of being entertaining it felt more like a political rally so please keep the politics out of movies in general on both sides 
Sep 17 2019,negative,same old story paired with unlikable actress no matter how much disney want it to success it just not that enjoyable 
Sep 17 2019,negative,it was very lackluster there was no emotion from the main character nothing that i could relate to from a human standpoint honestly i am very disappointed that she didnt show some emotion because emotions are human she was the amazing warrior with unlimited power marvel always worked because it brought a human element to the heroes there has to be a trade off for being all powerful she has none she has done nothing to earn the audiences support there was an amazing chance where jude law goads her character into a one on one match so she laser blasts him because she can i personally would have loved her to prove that she can beat him fair and square based on her talents and ability i think it actually does injustice to her character and women in general by having it so that the evil man can only ever be beat with ray beams perhaps she could beat him with her wits skills etc the character was very bland and all powerful like a more boring superman shes so powerful she could have beat thanos single handedly yetshe is written out of avengers endgame because there would be no movie otherwise     the movie goes over the top with nostalgia easter eggs instead of focusing on a strong character and good story they failed this character so poorly that shell never recover in the msheu this movie marks the beginning of the end of marvel
Sep 17 2019,negative,mediocre and boring film  samuel l jackson and the cat were far more interesting than captain marvel was throughout the entire movie great use of 3d and antiaging effects but that doesnt save the movie from itself and its mystery vibe and horrendous final fight
Sep 17 2019,negative,it was a weak movie weakest in the franchise maybe silghtly better than black panther 
Sep 16 2019,negative,total waste of time if i could give it a zero i would
Sep 16 2019,negative,i liked the kree skrull war in the comics too bad it got ruined by identity politics soapboxes and selfaggrandizement platforms in the movie
Sep 16 2019,negative,shazam this movie its all just spite and it shows 
Sep 16 2019,neutral,captain marvel feels unfinished as something is missing brie larson acts like she knows she is going to be part of something huge kind of annoying 
Sep 16 2019,negative,i watched it at home and have to say larsons acting was pretty bland and the movie was pretty bad the lack of emtions from the character make it difficult to like her and it was just a not a good marvel movie if this is the face of the marvel cinematic universe than that universe is going to sink like a rock cause she has no charisma or range in her acting in this movie the performance was robotic and it felt like they were telling a message over a story which just made it barely watchable
Sep 16 2019,negative,the main character captain marvel was so unlikeable and not because she is a woman but because she unlike most other main marvel hero doesnt have a funny side at all it made the movie dull and all of the jokes fell flat
Sep 16 2019,negative,incredibly stale and bland  brie larson lacks any charisma or acting chops do not recommend  
Sep 15 2019,positive,they didnt really go into her character much honestly could hav been better story wise and action wisem
Sep 15 2019,negative,storyline as bad as the last jedi story makes no sense at times for all the  spent they should get refunded by writers producers and director 
Sep 15 2019,positive,great film all the characters and how nick fury lost an eye  i rewatched it at home again so i would see all the parts i missed at the theater which wasnt many
Sep 15 2019,negative,such an uninspiring film with no ideas what so ever including awful writing and directingthis movie isnt just a bad marvel movie its a bad film 2510
Sep 15 2019,negative,many reasons for why this film failed for me
Sep 15 2019,negative,the movie was boring brie larson was awful worst mcu movie by a long shot 
Sep 15 2019,negative,i dont like the forced feminist agenda this movie has the kind of message that promoting women by playing victim white men are oppressor  aside from that the main character isnt interesting at all she can go through any obstacles with no effort shes too perfect and not relatable theres nothing to cheer for because we all know shes gonna accomplish it with the least effort being put into  
Sep 15 2019,negative,another fail by marvel to be politically correct instead of making movies 
Sep 15 2019,negative,absolutely aweful i really dont if anythings needed to say about this one most have been told so many times already
Sep 15 2019,negative,well first off the fact that they didnt even follow the story of the comics where monica rambeau was the second marvell is the first captain marvel carol is the 7th captain marvel character and they made her the first such dumb scenes especially with fury spoiler losing his eye to a catflerken which is basically kirby in cat form now all this aside if there was an actual good story line and flow to the movie it probably would have been good but the fact that all it was was people saying no you cant do that and her saying yes i can was lazy writing every hero goes through ups and downs to humanize them so they can resonate with the audience or at least be an inspiration to everyone there is nothing inspiring about captain marvel i would rather watch all twilight movies then this sorry excuse for a movie
Sep 15 2019,negative,a weakly told story 
Sep 14 2019,negative,a big potential wasted
Sep 14 2019,negative,i dont dislike larson as much as i dislike what they have her work with here playing an infantile godess with some sort of vague anger issue her screen presence is bland like a doll with led lights stuck on it storywise its a genuine stain on the mcu marvel crafted not one exciting note to be found i really dont understand the critic consensus here 
Sep 14 2019,negative,the movie is one big man hating joke and its not even a funny one the casting of captain marvel falls flat and she has zero personality this is a movie to hit check marks 
Sep 13 2019,negative,bland its got nothing really to say larson is bland the story is just pieces of other movies inserted into the mcu it has prequelitus where it has to answer questions that didnt need answering not a crime against humanity but just not good
Sep 13 2019,negative,i think this movie is overrated 
Sep 13 2019,negative,this movie was just meh brie larson and samuel l jackson did a good enough job however this is a superhero that no one asked for and none wanted so the whole concept of captain marvel seams insincere and forced in the delivery of a shallow bad cgi movie the issue could be that none of the characters apart from agent coulson are actually relatable 
Sep 13 2019,negative,boring and slow storyline is inconsistent major plot holes and unlikable characters 
Sep 13 2019,negative,it was fine one of the more mediocre marvel films 
Sep 12 2019,negative,you waste your time  
Sep 12 2019,negative,time for marvel to stop playing it so safe
Sep 12 2019,neutral,i think they tried to hard to make her so powerful the reason that the mcu was so good was because we fell in love with the characters even when they failed or made mistakes 
Sep 12 2019,negative,i thought it was ok but i couldnt overlook its overt political agendas
Sep 12 2019,positive,could have been much coolet
Sep 12 2019,neutral,one of the weakest mcu movies so far the protagonist has the personality of a rock there is nothing interesting about her and she seems like another dceu superman extremely powerful no weaknesses no personality etc i got bored half way through only watch if youre extremely bored 
Sep 12 2019,negative,this is bad just bad story makes little sense no character arc overuse of cgi and its not even good cgi  avoid if possible otherwise youll lose 2 hours of your life that you never see again
Sep 12 2019,positive,one of the mediocre mcu movies especially in terms of special effects but still entertaining enough
Sep 12 2019,negative,it is our comeuppance for hyping  overrating the marvel cinematic universe
Sep 11 2019,negative,by far the weakest mcu movie 
Sep 11 2019,negative,i was told to watch this before seeing endgame and i really wish that i hadnt i think this movie finally broke me my love for the superhero genre suffered tremendously after seeing this which not only plucked the low hanging fruit from the tree of superhero movie cliches but did so in a manner that just made all of the characters unlikable    not even samuel l jackson the coolest expletive deleted on the planet could salvage the emotionless tired and confusing plot to say the performances were stiff would be generous its as though the cast was told to act like they are in the final stages of a bad cold where they are awake but totally devoid of energy
Sep 11 2019,positive,exceptional origin story even with changes from the source material it still was an excellent film
Sep 11 2019,neutral,dull and lacking stakes for the entirety of the film filled with plot inconsistencies but sam jackson helps to alleviate the boredom with wit and charm suffers from two directors brie larson seems emotionless throughout the film symptom of being an disengaging actress
Sep 11 2019,neutral,it was just alright i think they could have selected a better actoractress to play captain marvel brie larson seemed too serious and should have had more personality
Sep 11 2019,negative,sjw movies suck no character development no struggles no nothing
Sep 11 2019,negative,made in a time where this type of movie are irrelevant in marvel
Sep 11 2019,negative,very bad movie i hated it
Sep 11 2019,negative,one of the least memorable of the marvel cinematic universe
Sep 10 2019,neutral,lets first start with the movies issues the main lead of the movie brie larsoncaptain marvel remains unchanged unfunny and quite bland throughout the entire movie  unfortunately the villain of the movie is also uninteresting but cant go into to to much detail without spoilers another problem is the action scenes which are choppy dark uninspired and lack any visual flare however the secondary characters are charming and fun especially samuel l jackson also the comedy for the most part is effective and gives the film a fun feeling however the movies positive elements dont out way the most egregious problem with the movieits lack of an interesting lead protagonist 
Sep 10 2019,positive,perhaps a character with too many emotions should have portrayed at least some amount of emotion oh well
Sep 10 2019,positive,this was an above average film it wasnt anything special and i really wished that we saw more acting skills from brie larson brie is an amazing actress but this movie made carol danvers a 1 dimensional character they missed so many opportunities the film was also pretty generic the fighting scenes and visual effects were amazing and the film did provide classic marvel humor which i adored i also liked the fact that hollywood is making more and more good standalone female superhero movies i personally think that captain marvel was a great addition to the to the marvel cinematic universe and i hope they show more dynamics to her character in future films
Sep 10 2019,positive,pretty mediocre considering the hype that was created about it but still a solid entry compared to most superhero novies
Sep 10 2019,positive,enjoyable nothing spectacular
Sep 10 2019,negative,first that comes to mind its more like a bad thriller  3 emotion due to memory manipulation the main char got no face expressionafter memorys restoredno faces and with op power was all of the sudden i like new heroes and there growththis was just a thriller where memory recovery lead to powers being upgraded to meh i can blow up the earth if boored  the only thing that was good was the polis dude  the cat  34 y who loves scifi but ya worse scifi i ever seen
Sep 10 2019,positive,the primary issue is that we have seen these type of origin story installments of super hero films too many times now this is nothing special but its not bad
Sep 10 2019,negative,i was not impressed which bries acting similar to her acting in king kong  there wasnt a moment that i felt her acting matches the role of her character  the cgi is mediocre in my opinion for a movie that had tons of money tossed into its production i gauge how good a movie is by when the next time i watch a movie and this is one that may be a few years before i put it back on again  not the same genre but ive rewatched the fugitive countless times i felt the character and struggle in that movie  not worth the hype   
Sep 9 2019,negative,compared to other marvel movies very boring story and characters 
Sep 9 2019,negative,worst acting ever such a disappointment for a marvel fan i cant believe i paid to watch that crap
Sep 9 2019,negative,seems forced hopefully black widow will be better
Sep 8 2019,negative,literally 2 out of 5 stars  i only watched it to not miss out on the mcu storyline  worst mcu film
Sep 8 2019,negative,this movie breaks its own plot many times  a movie about a woman that doesnt learn anything through out the movie she is a plank an empty plank  horrible movie the movie doesnt believe in learning growing being a human improving yourself  it has nothing to do with female empowerment  i felt even more empty after this movie what a hallow experience
Sep 8 2019,negative,disappointing to say the least its obviously attempting to cater to a left audience and is a lousy attempt at a marvel film brie larsons character is more boring than i can even explain she is given zero character development and their excuse is that she has amnesia but this claim is completely false as she is as one sided at the beginning as she is at the end of the film i can give no reason for anyone to see this film even for marvel fans this movie seems pointless without a doubt the worst marvel film to date
Sep 8 2019,positive,great sound track  
Sep 8 2019,negative,the story was quite base without intrigue making a hero too powerful defeats the story arc many characters including marvel were flat and not very endearing 
Sep 7 2019,negative,2nd worst marvel movie a little bit better than the incredible hulk definite filler between 
Sep 7 2019,negative,honestly it was very weak
Sep 7 2019,positive,it was funny and i loved the strength of this female superhero
Sep 7 2019,negative,painful and tedious
Sep 7 2019,negative,unwatchable at any speed
Sep 7 2019,positive, it takes an hour to get there but when it happens cm eventually becomes a worthy addition to the marvel franchise in its entirety the film triumphs in delivering another quality adventure that whimsically develops the origins of past and present avenger mysteries
Sep 7 2019,positive,a fun movie id recommend it to anyone who wants to watch a fun adventuresuperhero movie great to watch with a couple of friends laugh and be merry
Sep 7 2019,positive,i love marvel movies expected greatness but it was ok but not great for girl power more girl ass kicking woman empowerment would have been great it had a empty vibe that was misleading i was thinking this was full of action and drama with 90s flashbacks and fun but it wasnt im seemed like the movie was done at the last minute like in school you go last at presentations because youre doing it in class it gave me twilight vibes i thought that was going to be a vampire action movie then its a weird love story that wasnt that great
Sep 7 2019,negative,i found this movie disappointing  the plot was predictable and weak  most superhero movies are in some way inspirational but this one fails to inspire  there were some good and humorous    moments  in the grand total it fell flat for me
Sep 7 2019,negative,plot was everywhere and nonsensical her acting was horrendous
Sep 7 2019,negative,no emotion and just an overpowered character boring
Sep 7 2019,negative,captain marvel the character is terribly written shes always right has a ready quip for everything and for someone with no memory she was sure up on current pop culture and never loses boring
Sep 6 2019,negative,acting was wooden fury was the best part of this movie
Sep 6 2019,negative,the performance from the main actress was awful i would have preferred it if she was more upbeat and a little less doom and gloom its a hero movie not a never ending apocalypse heros are supposed to be positive and bring a sense of security while watching them not feel full and complacent
Sep 6 2019,negative,a completely forgettable superhero movie somewhere between the old hulk movies and aquaman bad plot bad acting which is surprising as larson has shown excellent acting chops in other films so perhaps she just wasnt bought in or had bad direction    i put this squarely as an airplane movie that is one i wouldnt watch in theaters or on netflixstreaming but one i would watch on a plane if i had nothing else to see which is incidentally how i watched it
Sep 6 2019,negative,it was slow and just not what i was hoping for  real diversity would be if monica was captain marvel  there wasnt much character depth in the writing and it was as if we were supposed to have some kind of connection to the mcu because nick fury was in it  
Sep 6 2019,negative,full of inconsistency and lacking actual characterization this certainly falls into the lower caliber of mcu films
Sep 6 2019,negative,god thats wasnt good i was trying to catch up to the hype train but this was trash i feel like its barely better than the hulk or black panther 
Sep 6 2019,negative,i say this as a lifelong marvel movie fan this is the worst one i have seen so far this feels weaker than elektra even worse than dcs cat woman and on top of that add the fact that i just cant shake the feeling that this movie has an sjw agenda doesnt help
Sep 6 2019,negative,really missed opportunity oof it was rotten
Sep 6 2019,negative,good grief what happened to marvel
Sep 6 2019,negative,wow this movied was poorly made
Sep 6 2019,negative,worst marvel movie to date
Sep 6 2019,negative,this was a horrible experience how can marvel sink so low omg una experiencia horrible 
Sep 6 2019,negative,it was an ok marvel movie on the same level as antman thor and ironman 3 it is yet another origin story for a superhero movie which can be great by itself but brie larson is simply not charismatic or talented enough for the role of carol danvers overall the movie was very hyped but ended up falling short of its promises
Sep 6 2019,positive,over all i give captain marvel a positive review you really should watch it if you havent but watch the other marvel movies first the movie begins in a very unique abstract way that was definitely new for marvel and the different abstract styles this movie premiered won me over there were many beautiful aesthetic scenes that showcased a chaotic moment in a peaceful way using amazing cinematography editing lighting and soundtrack and it was all done very well with a good balance the beginning is almost not confusing it makes you try to make inferences and as the movie goes on you realize that you were completely wrong throughout the movie you learn more about carol danvers past at the same time as she does you dont know anything that the main character doesnt which makes the movie very unpredictable and excitingintriguing to watch you really do feel like your going along with her  the overall tone and 90s aesthetic was very beautifulflexible yet controlled lighting matched throughout the movie yet it was still unique to each scene lighting is one of my favorite things about this movie the lighting was extremely well thought out throughout the whole movie it was always making me feel like how the character was feeling and the movie as a whole was just a great aesthetic and made me feel extremely nostalgic for the 90s even though i wasnt even alive in the 90s the cgi in this film is absolutely incredible except for two scenes that arent too important so it doesnt set off the film significantly   the worst part about this film is all the holes this almost ruined the movie for me there were obvious holes in the plot or script that i could pick out after only watching it once i wont talk specifically about any to avoid spoilers but it was frustrating at some parts because it seemed like marvel basically was hoping that people wouldnt pay too close attention and notice any mistakes the plot in general character relationships cinematography nostalgia and humor definitely saved the film and made it great  all of the acting in this film kept everything smooth which i was very happy about because even 1 bad actor can change the whole mood of the movie i loved the character carol danvers and brie larson really did do an amazing job i just wish the screenscript writers went a little more in depth with her character added more emotion so we could know the backstory of her life before the origin story of her hero life because it seemed more like i was watching a side character and i wish that marvel treated carols character like they did with captain america or iron man where they really went into the character while still advancing the plot one of my favorite things about this film is the characters relationships there were so many funny heartwarming happy relationships between characters that really make this film so enjoyable there were also a few cliche scenes but not a ridiculous amount there were way more creative scenes that i havent ever seen in any other movie again with the script writers after some of the lines i was like wait what lol why on the other side some lines were just plain perfect along with irrealistic lines there were a lot of irrealistic events that happened that the movie shouldnt have gotten away with  this movie is definitely aimed at teenageradult audiences the humor is very clever definitely had me laughing out loud the sound track wow it just fits the movie perfectly its full of 90s nostalgia songs as well as original tracks that combined the classic marvel touch with spacey 90s vibes all of the settings for the scenes were also very well thought out and just perfect for the plot though we dont see too much character development of young carol danvers before the  no spoilers this movie still completes a very satisfying ark and i honestly found myself really sad when it ended like i already missed it  
Sep 6 2019,negative,this movie covers a main character shoe horned into the universe a little too late in the game from 0 to 1000 in a single movie arc moves the bar so fast that you forget where it began
Sep 6 2019,negative,the character arc is forced and brie larsons take on the character is not entertaining
Sep 6 2019,negative,i feel that she only had this movie to justify what minor role she had with thanos in endgame to which he became the captain of her slowly looking into her eyes they passionately kissed but she pulls away slightly scared i cant youre thanos and i have to protect the planets but he only pulled her closer and smiled i am inevitable before she gave into her carnal desires and kissed him once more flying off with thanos as the avengers looked on dumbfounded 
Sep 6 2019,negative,one of the worst characters in one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life absolute dumpster fire
Sep 6 2019,negative,gave it a solid meh
Sep 6 2019,negative,minor character with too much power screws up the marvel cinematic universe 
Sep 6 2019,negative,only marvel movie i havent enjoyed hoping its not the future direction of the franchise
Sep 5 2019,negative,horrible identity politics continue to ruin more movies ive been really looking forward to watching
Sep 5 2019,negative,if i could give this movie lower i would it is sad really i would have loved a good captain marvel movie as she is a great character the story is a mess with so many issues that dont make sense also brie is very bland in this most of the mcu cast have put in strong performances since the first movie and she fails to live up to the lowest bar     also i understand that nick fury in this movie is young but they have made him this comic relief character who loses his eye to an alien cat because it scratched him nick fury is a badass there are 100s of amazing things you could have done with meaning and depth instead of this good job    im not bothered too much by the empowering scenes for women in this at points they do seem forced but they are in the 70s 80s and 90s i think     i liked the skrulls but thought the kree were meh illogical and dumb i want smart well written villains at the end of the movie it would have been much better if captain marvel beat jude laws character in a fist fight rather than the blast it would have been more impressive     actually one thing with the skrulls i didnt like was their plan they are willing to sacrifice 100s1000s of their kind to find a few dozen by hopefully luring the kree to the planet their on and hopefully they bring captain marvel and hopefully she gets separated and they can hopefully capture her also hopefully they can find info they need     honestly some funny 90s jokes here and there but not enough for me to actually say this is a good movie when a movie or series has a character who learns nothing throughout the movie acts like they know everything and seems to just because and remains almost emotionless throughout and is depicted poorly due to bad acting its not a good movieseries captain marvel is an excellent character she is strong and a symbol she still has to learn things along the way everyone does i also want to say naming the avengers after her is just so so dumb and all that bs with the tesseract was somewhat nonsensical 
Sep 5 2019,negative,lots of propaganda and undeveloped characters the only reason id give it a single star is the acting from the actress that played monica rambeau and the actress that played her mother that side story seemed more interesting and their characters had more appeal than anything else in this film having a dumb twist where you make the refugees aliens from another planet good guys was uninspired and hokey in all the wrong ways the critics can play up their agenda all day still wont make this turd anymore watchable   
Sep 5 2019,neutral,its a marvel movie so its not bad but i got more enjoyment out of iron fist and the inhumans
Sep 5 2019,negative,political tones aside i am neither a orange man lover nor do i like communism in any format i could care less this was a terrible move because it told a simple story that could have been told in 20 minutes in another movie  it just drug on forever and ever  special effects of course are decent but the plot is uninspired and there was no big wow moment in the film just felt like i plodded from one unkempt field to another  sad that this is the pinnacle character of marvel who has become the poster child for all that will go wrong with comic movies when they start to take themselves too seriously  you have the scripts in the comics dummies  use them
Sep 5 2019,negative,bland and unlikable film i got absolutely nothing out of it and certainly wasnt entertained
Sep 5 2019,negative,if you like lots of big bang visual effects but a lame plot and back story this film is for you
Sep 5 2019,negative,too pc too predictable too boring      we need better story lines and some death of character
Sep 5 2019,negative,the worst mcu movie 
Sep 5 2019,positive,good funcm was perhaps a little lacking in jeopardy but a nice addition to the mcu
Sep 5 2019,negative,the movie was boring seemed rushed to put her in end game and her acting was  meh
Sep 5 2019,positive,its a pretty fun ride the disparity between the actual content of the movie vs the reaction to say black panther is a bit odd this movie did have some misses and was a bit on the nose with its message but i was less taken out of the movie by a feminist no doubt scored fight scene then by terrible chi rhinos and 2x cut scenes fighting on the train stage of battle arena toshinden    loved the buddy cop dynamic and mostly the deaging aside from letting sam jackson run with old body and young face also bringing back coulsen is 1 point     captain marvel could definitely use some opening up in the personality dept but considering where she was in her escaping alien mind control arc it makes sense compare this to phase 1 origins or say dr strange and i think it was all in all a fun ride
Sep 5 2019,negative,just one word cringe
Sep 5 2019,negative,come on marvel super hero action its what we want you can save the pc agenda for pc movies 
Sep 5 2019,neutral,not bad but just average expected more than what it delivered 
Sep 5 2019,positive,there were a lot of holes in the story to anyone who follows comics but the action was pretty good 
Sep 5 2019,negative,horrible piece of crap
Sep 5 2019,negative,this movie is poison and it has been injected into the marvel universe the marvel universe will no longer be the wonder that we know and love in 5 years time
Sep 5 2019,negative,some parts were interesting they definitely rusheddidnt have any character development for carol and her character is bleh shes a feminist less than humble supposed to come off as funny and isnt superhero with all the powers some characters made up for her vapid personality overall ok wouldnt spend money seeing her in part 2 i saw her in avengers before i saw this movie and she off as not a good team member loner better than everyone super hero this movie showed more of that
Sep 5 2019,negative,marvel lost the plot with this one story was boring acting was crap and i couldnt wait to get out of theatre i hope they make the next one bit more exciting fun 
Sep 5 2019,negative,not a bad one  neither a good one a mediocre story  held up by the rich lore of mcu
Sep 5 2019,negative,id give it no stars if it where possible
Sep 5 2019,negative,i really dislike this movie comes across as very boring
Sep 5 2019,negative,just wasnt good
Sep 4 2019,negative,horrible movie bad story boring characters except fury boring fights
Sep 4 2019,negative,watched this because i thought it might be important leading into endgame turns out it had very little to do with it from a story perspective it was more an origin story for the character being introduced in that movie entirely predictable film plenty of cringe
Sep 4 2019,negative,more boring movie they have nothing to tell
Sep 4 2019,negative,finally watched it fell asleep tried it again just blah glad i waited until i only had to pay 399 for it
Sep 4 2019,negative,what is this whats with hollywood trying to preach politics when im here just to be entertained this is the worst marvel movie ive ever seen 
Sep 4 2019,negative,sadly a block of cheese shows more emotion than the star of this film i hope she gets acting lessons for the inevitable sequel captain marvel 2 emotion killer
Sep 4 2019,negative,id give it negative stars if i could poor writing poor acting poor deliver horrible social justice pushing crap 
Sep 4 2019,negative,smh this isnt captain marvel if you want an actual depiction check avengers earths mightiest heroes
Sep 4 2019,negative,it sucked butt ive seen more emotion in a cockroach stuck to a glue pad
Sep 4 2019,negative,a non movie no arc and no characterization to speak of
Sep 4 2019,negative,too much mainstream politics for so few quality
Sep 4 2019,negative,rather flat story trying to hide behind overthetop special effects wont be watching a sequel to this one
Sep 4 2019,negative,good acting performance poor story poor character poor concept over powered super heroes dont work
Sep 4 2019,negative,the worst marvel movie to date
Sep 4 2019,negative,this is one of the worst marvel movies i ever seen
Sep 4 2019,negative,terrible movie terrible main character cool cgi though 
Sep 4 2019,negative,brie larson was probably the single worst casting choice that marvel has ever made viola davis of course did a fantastic job and the cast of this movie was working overtime to carry it ive never seen a more boring mary sue in my life im glad i watched it once to fill out the cinematic universe but the fact that this was made before a good black widow film is baffling
Sep 4 2019,negative,the movie was not horrible but it was not good either story was not good no real struggle for the hero im sure critics will lie and say its good for a certain reason
Sep 4 2019,negative,it was somewhat entertaining at times but it was definitely not marvel at its best would not watch it again and will probably skip the sequel
Sep 4 2019,negative,garbage a story we have seen before with acting that is phoned in and dry
Sep 4 2019,negative,i love marvel but this one was a bad apple of the bunch brie larson plays a character who is the villain for most of the movie and has no redeeming qualities 
Sep 4 2019,negative,not worth watching weakest marvel movie 
Sep 4 2019,negative,i honestly thought it was a bit boring poor sammy hes gettin old 
Sep 4 2019,positive,captain marvel is a great character however brie larsons acting is a bit awkward and unbearable at certain times story lacked a bit of depth and finality however decent intro to a new character
Sep 4 2019,negative,predictable the acting seemed flat 
Sep 4 2019,positive,im not entirely sure why people rated this so poorly  i think a lot of people felt that replacing a male comic book character capt marvel with a female lead was what bothered the fanboys  but this was a great movie with the right amount of action 
Sep 4 2019,negative,bad story no build up of how she obtained or mastered her power just shoved in our faces that captain marvel is supremely powerful
Sep 4 2019,negative,its a dull average movie with a now all to familiar plot with way too much emphasis on its political messages  i also dont understand why critics have rated it so highly i am sure i am not alone in not being happy at attempts to be manipulated politically  i just want to watch films  this is all starting to be the norm 
Sep 4 2019,negative,any movie where the star of the movie wasnt the actual star of the movie is gonna be bad mendelsohn was simply the best part of this movie followed by samuel jackson unfortunately goose the cat a literal cat was more entertaining than bree larson for a studio with a plethora of superhero origin stories under its belt this film falls flat on its face the issues this underwhelming movie had began to show itself in the marketing and i didnt listen to my instincts and wasted money at the theaters to see this film they chose the wrong person to be captain marvel and the wrong director brees acting range was about as wide as a playing card and left so much wanting they completely stomped on the history of a long established character in marvell and so obviously were trying to push a certain agenda with multiple cringe worthy moments in this film i really could have waited for this film to be on tv this is the only comic book based movie that i do not own that in itself tells you what i think of it 
Sep 4 2019,negative,unfortunately another marvel movie that disappoints of the 20 ones only a few delivered a movie that truly removes you from the day without slamming you with their political messages 
Sep 4 2019,negative,captain marvel was bland we dont get to see her struggle with her new powers there is very little explanation of what she can and cannot do overall the movie had a few good moments but they were few and far between 
Sep 4 2019,negative,bland boring thats it 
Sep 4 2019,negative,potentially a big movie but not getting to any point the big amount of politics and the wrong timeline and plot made a big mess of this character 
Sep 4 2019,negative,contrived dull and not at all entertaining
Sep 4 2019,negative,boring unashamed cash grab brie larsen is a pretty good actor but you cant really tell because whoever wrote the script gave all the best lines to samuel jackson and all the best scenes to the cat dont get me started on the skrulls worst misuse of a classic villain ever and a major loss of the excellent secret wars storyline marvel dropped the ball 
Sep 4 2019,negative,decent action but the content and the obvious agenda behind this movie is anything but fresh 
Sep 4 2019,negative,wooden acting boring story but sam jackson is great
Sep 4 2019,neutral,this is definitely one of marvels weakest movies i consider antman 2 to be one of the worst marvel movies but this movie is just as bad its just not exciting its boring and unoriginal maybe part two will be better
Sep 4 2019,negative,captain marvel is marvel studios first foray into the bland and boring this film was a letdown from screenplay to end credits your fans deserve better marvel
Sep 4 2019,positive,not a bad one not terribly exciting either an good watch for free on a place ride
Sep 4 2019,negative,couldnt like the main character  i guess that charisma is important    
Sep 3 2019,negative,pretty boring at parts brie larson seems to have only two modes of acting soundtrack isnt great and for a marvel movie i dont think i laughed at any of the jokes
Sep 3 2019,neutral,this was a below average movie the build up was pretty lame and the inconsistencies in her power made it seem like the writers didnt know what direction to take it
Sep 3 2019,negative,not quite as boring as thor the dark world but is definitely at the bottom of the mcu in terms of entertainment  if it werent for samuel l jackson and the cat then id only give it half of a star
Sep 3 2019,negative,wow mcu is taking the plunge into nonsensical propagandism they really need to catch themselves before becoming irrelevant again 
Sep 3 2019,negative,yeah this was probably the most annoying marvel character in the mcu so far really killed the film   
Sep 3 2019,negative,no emotion or expressions from brie larson     so many plot holes in the mcu her power level doesnt make sense how she can keep up with thanos with the power of one stone doesnt make sense to me 
Sep 3 2019,negative,pointless movie just to introduse captain marvel and the scrulls
Sep 3 2019,negative,honestly this movie lacked a narrative although i was happy i was going to be introduced to another hero at the beginning i was quickly disappointed the lead lacks charisma but at least the supporting cast can compensate
Sep 3 2019,negative,anything that panders gets a low score plus don cheadle is the man 
Sep 3 2019,negative,poorly written and extremely bland characters i felt marvel had done a good job of representing women in the mcu but this was so over the top and blatantly about a strong female lead she had no weaknesses even thanos has weaknesses 
Sep 3 2019,positive,it still great movie and fights but it do not feel like mcu mo
Sep 3 2019,negative,surprisingly felt like a dc movie glazed with a marvel finish dc because they ignore character flaws and super power just works now im surprised marvel laid this egg between the biggest films when we could have gotten something that dissected thanos a more known character or 5 years without everyone plot kinda tripped over itself a few times the plot connivence was a bit overpowering and the villains were by far the most interesting characters superman but with less bells and whistles to distract me from unrelatable character
Sep 2 2019,negative,the mack daddy doesnt approve
Sep 2 2019,positive,compared to the other mcu movies its pretty average but its still good a fine  addition to the mcu
Sep 2 2019,negative,very little of this film involves me i enjoyed the special effects but none of the acting ill blame the director met my expectations the story is weak and the lead character not really mortal at any time 
Sep 2 2019,negative,carol danvers had absolutely no character development at all the movie producers were hell bent on pushing a feminist narrative instead of making decent movies also they turned nick furry into a cat loving softy and having scar be from a cat totally diminishes his bad ass persona
Sep 2 2019,negative,the skrulls clearly are the bad guys which is why they prefer to subvert and rule from the shadows they refuse to be held accountable for their actions unlike the cre
Sep 2 2019,neutral,important to see for the larger mcu but its a fairly mediocre film on its own
Sep 2 2019,negative,horrible just horrible ruining the marvel movie enterprise is unforgiveable the acting was cringe 
Sep 2 2019,negative,i really wanted to root for captain marvel but she seemed more like a robot with no emotion and 0 relatability 
Sep 2 2019,negative,ehh pretty bland really 
Sep 2 2019,positive,i guess the movie is good enough but i still think that there couldve been more 
Sep 2 2019,negative,aside from the fact that they ruined the real story of captain mar vel and instead told carol danvers story the 4th person to hold captain marvels powers really ruined the movie before i saw it after that the movie itself was boring and just pandered feminism is captain marvel the most powerful super hero no so why make this uninteresting character the most powerful hero is the mcu i feel like phase 4 has already failed at this point 
Sep 2 2019,negative,pretty bad the only good part of it was the catthing 
Sep 2 2019,negative,i will never get that time back
Sep 2 2019,negative,waisted my money seeing this one wish i would have know before hand
Sep 2 2019,positive,an enjoyable well paced film it sits as one of the top 5 of the marvel films in my personal rankings loved the attention to detail  of the times
Sep 2 2019,negative,this was by far and away the worst marvel movie i have ever seen and heart breaking for a fan who had watched the franchise since ironman 2008   it destroyed the continuity of the franchise as a whole made a mockery of the hero journey and preached feminist propaganda at me for the whole movie   which as a woman who has no interest in being told i am weak unless i believe these stories stories i have not experienced myself means this movie leaves a bad taste in my mouth story wise   it ignores comic canon has terrible acting from the central characters and does a disservice to nick fury in the process   i was so disappointed with this film that it made me less excited for endgame and even her appearance in endgame which i saw 3 times in the theatres was met with eyerolls or audible groans from everyone male female or child that i could see in the theatre   bad move marvel
Sep 2 2019,negative,meeeeeeeeeeeh i think this is the weakest movie in the mcu
Sep 2 2019,negative,pretty weak and unengaging lacks a heroes journey and the acting is flat
Sep 2 2019,negative,the acting was poor the cringe of identity politics made it even harder to watch wife and i both are glad we waited for it to come out in redbox
Sep 1 2019,negative,the worst marvel movie in the catalog so disappointing this is what they choose to represent women dcs wonder woman crushes captain marvel i really hope the next set of films doesnt ruin what they built on the back of iron man and cap
Sep 1 2019,positive,perhaps i saw a different streaming cut but it just wasnt the sjw disaster id been led to believe a bit on the nose in places with a parade of pantomime villains in the girls past but i still cheered when she made good pleasantly surprised
Sep 1 2019,negative,probably one of the worst marvel movie ever made 
Sep 1 2019,negative,it starts well but stagnates in the middle it becomes a boring movie with many plot holes   brie larson is ok 
Sep 1 2019,positive,this movie was great i mean i really dont understand why people hate it so much
Aug 31 2019,negative,the shame of it was the acting was pretty good the problem was everything else  the story is terrible  the characters are interacting as if they are old friends even though they have never met they want you to care about some of these characters feelings even though you know nothing about them  and to top it all off the plot twist is so predictable that it was obvious within minutes of starting the movie  
Aug 30 2019,negative,the screenwriting here is just embarrassing the pandering is so over the top its hard to watch and not role your eyes
Aug 30 2019,negative,extremely disappointed they want to introduce captain marvel as the next super woman on par with wonder woman and it is the weakest story but it did meet the meh  passed the time test
Aug 29 2019,negative,horrendously written its a boring film with bland acting that tries to depict an empowering character but ends up making no more tan a despiteful narcissist
Aug 29 2019,positive,i love this movie it doesnt deserve all the hate at all brie is amazing and looking forward to the sequel
Aug 29 2019,negative,lead ends up being a mary sue no tension at all because shes basically superman with no kryptonite
Aug 29 2019,negative,utter crap that doesnt fit in with the mcu shes a totally broken character that gets whatever powers she needs whenever she needs them and were only told not shown that shes such an amazing person
Aug 28 2019,positive,its not as bad as everyone says i actually really like it
Aug 28 2019,negative,despite the negativity from online critics and the toxic media circus around brie larson i gave captain marvel a shot it had some bright moments mostly though it sucked
Aug 28 2019,negative,felt like a big step back in the mcu get me my rogue movie
Aug 28 2019,positive,enjoyable action pack film brie and samuel have good chemistry whilst jude law puts in a decent performance
Aug 28 2019,negative,everyone else acted better than brie larson even the skrulls and the cat
Aug 28 2019,positive,a bit plain the characters feel flat but its so nice to see strong females characters who share meaningful bonds
Aug 28 2019,negative,the worst movie ive seen this year
Aug 27 2019,negative,its like watching thor dark world but woke
Aug 27 2019,negative,absolute garbage    the plot is to find a faster than lightspeed space ship in a universe where apace ships can fold space and go through wormholes stupid    the main charscter is arrogant but she eants to olay it coll that it is good amd ahe doesnt learn anything by it till the end as her main character progeression is when her friend tell her who she is by sinple words like strong smart fun while she doesnt show any signs of these but accept it nevertheless    hiw do we foind oursleves by a friend telling us exactly who we are nd that we are perfect    why people have existencial crysises if thats that easy    phathetic    brie larson has 0 acreen presence and that ruins a movie which based on the main heros charisma how it csn emanate the lightwell shes only emanating light when shes cgid     the jokes are bad the action is mediocre at best if not worst the villains are subpar and obvious    its full of plotholes as well as the main premise is a plothole itself    this was the first really great flop of marvel in all the mcu    i recoomend not to watch it if youre a super fan of cpt marvel this gonna hurt more then anything if youre not a fan but fan of the mcu its  gonna hurt moderstely and if youre not a fan of any if thisyoure 100 wasting the precious time of your life whith this overmarketed badly written dumb forced and even boring piece of garbage    any other marvel movie will give you more joy than this movie but honestly even the old marvel films 80s were better because on those st lesst you could have a laugh ir two    avoid it at all cost
Aug 27 2019,negative,i dont have any emotional connection with any scene in this film
Aug 27 2019,positive,i think the main reason people are so critical of this movie is their dislike of the actress i think this is an unfair way to judge the movie personally i think the cosmic aspect of this movie drew me in from the first minute from there on the story was entertaining and had bits of humour and nice character moments the actual characters in the movie are memorable and fun brie larson gave an impactful performance and moved me with some of her scenes the action in this movie was fun and exciting throughout the marvel blockbuster the visuals were stunning all of the action with captain marvel after she realised her full potential was for me breathtaking and completely awesome in a way the fact that others dislike this movie kind of make me feel as if its my own little special movie that i like
Aug 26 2019,positive,great film brie was excellent well written well directed and nicely put together overall im a bit stunned by the sexist nonsense ive seen in so many fan or antifan reviews dont believe a word of it
Aug 26 2019,neutral,not great this movie was touted as being a necessary watch for endgame it was not captain marvel had less impact and screen time then nebula vast plot holes and unnecessary story leads makes this one of the worst marvel movies to date
Aug 25 2019,positive,not visually as good as aquaman of course but it has some qualities especially some humour and a good sense of rythm and a quite nice bunch of actors
Aug 25 2019,negative,entertaining at times saved from being a complete disappointment by samuel l jackson but ultimately falls flat with a main character that is not relatable and whose character arc is uninspiring
Aug 25 2019,neutral,a typical marvel movie not as interesting nor captivating as the others but definitely not as bad as the incels make it out to be
Aug 24 2019,positive,i dont understand what was all the rage and crisicm about but ill guess it was about larsons terrible acting the movie was good but not marvels best 
Aug 24 2019,positive,captain marvel is an intriguing film set in the 1990s which differentiates it from other mcu films however its poorly thought out script and pacing issues further distract from the already complicated origin story furthermore the film contains one of the most dull villains in the entire mcu and i didnt resonate with any of the supporting characters that came from outer space overall the scenes on earth are what sold me on this film but the rest feels pretty hit or miss
Aug 24 2019,positive,captain marvel starring brie larson as carol danvers samuel l jackson as agent fury ben mendelsohn as talos leader of the skrulls and jude law as commander of starforce is the 21st installment in mcu and its first femaleled superhero movie  captain marvel was deliberately set up as the hope for all kind in the only postcredits scene in infinity war does captain marvel live up to that hype lets find it  whats good in the movie  the comic timing of nick fury is something for which you can go to watch this movie the young agent fury who knows nothing about the existence of alien species and get stuck in an intergalactic war here you will find how he lost his eye i personally liked ben mendelsohns character i cant say more about that character as it will lead to spoilers brie larson as captain marvel doesnt disappoint if it comes to acting and dialogue delivery the movie is having emotions action and comedy all at one place you cant forget the cat goose which is having her own importance in the movie once you leave the theatre  if so much is good in the movie then whats the problem  the main problem of the movie is its action sequences and the underwhelming villains jude laws entry in mcu is forgettable i wanted more from his level of actor the script doesnt do justice to his character none of the villains could match with marvels powers the movie shows her stronger than needed the fight scenes were like a joke this movie is no match to typical avengers movie  so is captain marvel worth watching  overall the movie is enjoyable to some extent all thanks to samuel l jackson you can give it a try and one more thing you are really gonna enjoy the mid credit scene lets hope the future installments would be more mature
Aug 24 2019,negative,a major blemish on the marvel movie franchise 
Aug 23 2019,negative,eh it was just really dull
Aug 23 2019,negative,waste of time and money
Aug 23 2019,positive,wasnt a bad movie but wasnt something id recommend to someone who wanted to know what movies to see brie larson possibly gave off one of the most uncharismatic performances of her career but is still pretty decent considering the script she was given it couldve taken advantage of the time period by adding some more tracks from the 90s but it did fit a good amount in considering the runtime and plot was pretty funny at times and i dont regret seeing it wouldnt recommend it but you should definitely watch it if your doing a stan lee marvel marathon or are curious 
Aug 23 2019,negative,terrible plot way too men are the worst and just dont get it take away all that you just have an absurdly simplistic plot with a predictable ending 
Aug 23 2019,negative,honesty this movie was a hard watch at best this is a straight to dvd script with an enormous budget this film is a force feeding of captain marvel and im not saying that as a fan of the marvel universe i was bored while watching this movie i couldnt wait for it to be over with terrible plot hooks and even more terrible one liners the nostalgia of the 90s comedy was the only relief  i experienced while attending this movie beside when the end credits started to roll since i knew that i somehow survived the viewing of captain marvel i loved brie larson in scott pilgrim vs the world however her performance seems phoned in and jude law was in the movie  do not pass go take my money and go directly to jail
Aug 22 2019,negative,slightly below average the main character is too op and the ending was boring loved what that one thing they changed from the cannon though
Aug 22 2019,positive,no high expectations going into this one and it was pretty decent actually captain marvels genese was enjoyable duo with fury did the trick
Aug 21 2019,negative,this was an exercise in making a political point first and a movie second you can make films with stong female leads see alien and terminator but the story comes first not the other way around make a film with your political point first and the viewer can feel like they are bieng force fed propaganda 
Aug 20 2019,negative,i wanted to like this movie so badly but in the end couldnt even make it through the whole thing  the whole thing just felt bland lukewarm and lifeless  brie larsons captain marvel was emotionally vacant and try as i might i just could not connect with the story at all  spent the first third of the movie telling myself to just keep watching it would get better  then i just gave up and decided i would literally rather match socks than continue viewing the film
Aug 20 2019,positive,rich visual thrills awesome acting by the cast and a powerful brie larson takes marvel to a new level although the story falls flat
Aug 20 2019,positive,a departure from the average mcu films is fun and welltimed
Aug 19 2019,neutral,if this movie was released before antman i wouldve been impressed but now it looks so stale and average it was boring 
Aug 19 2019,neutral,i expected more with the story and visually it came across as a movie trying to prove a point about gender roles and got a little too preachy about it i came to see a kickass superhero movie and instead got sucked into a movie with a political agenda and little heart the cast saved the movie and i enjoyed watching brie larson in the titular role but it couldve been better
Aug 19 2019,negative,stale boring garbage with forced messages and effects that made me want to die how did marvel produce these trash effects 11 years after the revolutionary iron man sam jackson was great though
Aug 19 2019,positive,this movie was very similar to the comics and tied the marvel universe timeline together quite well very entertaining as we learn the background to captain marvel and how she realized the full extent of her powers a mustsee for fans and women everywhere 
Aug 18 2019,negative,okay listen anything made by marvel at this point has the best of the best behind it and i think ive grown to expect a  certain pizzazz from marvel movies and this movie just did not go  i felt the casting was all off and  brie larson do a terrible job of potraying a quality comic character well  her acting lacked depth  but so did her writing she has no personality aside from a witty remark followed by a smirk  come on marvel you know better  
Aug 18 2019,neutral,225 this movie was pretty bad
Aug 18 2019,positive,pretty good better than i thought it would beand more action for sure than in the 3 hour endgame
Aug 18 2019,positive,captain marvel is a wonderful inspiring and empowering movie about a woman that lost everything and tried to find herself while also possessing the aweinspiring and exciting action of a marvel film yet it has received quite bad reviews for reasons to me unjustifiable
Aug 18 2019,negative,it just felt like a 2 hour advertisement for why captain marvel will be in endgame and even specifically says at the end captain marvel will appear in the avengers endgame and hackneys why fury calls them the avengers rather than tell a more interesting story theyre just presenting the character and saying this is why shell appear in endgame because thats all everyone seemed to care about is who dies in infinity war who appears in endgame
Aug 18 2019,positive,despite the negative reviews my friend and i actually enjoyed this movie quite a bit id rate it 98
Aug 17 2019,negative,all of the character buildinggrowth is in the first 5 minutes making a flawless and all powerful hero that never loses is not how you make an interesting hero samuel l jackson carried this movie on his shoulder 
Aug 17 2019,positive,it was a cool film not over cgid cool plot i want to see more of the character sorry i rented it instead of seeing it in theater one of the more fun marvel films to watch i loved brie larson in the film she was perfect
Aug 17 2019,positive,the lighthearted tone makes a good excuse to ignore all the usual comic book movie ridiculousness and paves the way for some absolutely hilarious moments this is the feel good superhero movie
Aug 16 2019,positive,captain marvel the best movie ever of mcu that i watch it in the cinema because the movie cgi story its beautiful from the start to finish than shazam for me this is the best and favortie movie ever of all time that is captain marvel espiecally the best star and my idol the best captain marvel brie larson 
Aug 15 2019,negative,poor acting poor storyline boring a pathetic addition to the avengers 
Aug 15 2019,positive,too much unnecessary hate 
Aug 15 2019,positive,a good story a nice movie a solid mcu entry especially i liked the unpredictable skrull twist however i think there are still some bad ones out there  unfortunately the mc does not seem to have something like emotions it looks a bit like oh for avengers endgame we need a deus ex machina a solution for all unsolvable problems but we just need a soldier not a complete character so in the sequels i hope she is more shown from her emotional aspect  minus one star but its still a fine movie with awesome sfx
Aug 14 2019,negative,blandest mcu film to date would have rather watched thor the dark world again
Aug 14 2019,neutral,danvers the allpowerful robbed the story of one of the greatest aspects of a super hero movierising above yourself to acheive your goals despite your weaknesses danvers doesnt even have to try hard it is the problem that dc has with superman 
Aug 14 2019,negative,so bad very tire and much hype but so dissapointment movie
Aug 14 2019,neutral,its a perfectly passable movie but i would consider it one of the worse implementations of the marvel formula i certainly dont feel like i wasted my money but i dont see myself rewatching it the same way i do thor ragnorok or guardians of the galaxy 
Aug 13 2019,negative,terrible movie could barley even finish it id recommend watching it only since its in the mcu
Aug 13 2019,negative,i wish i could give it zero stars
Aug 12 2019,negative,horrifyingly boring fast forward to the last half hour and you might like it
Aug 12 2019,positive,really enjoyed this better than some said about middle pack of marvel for me
Aug 12 2019,positive,while brie larson was a bad choice for the role of carol danvers the movie and story itself is a wonderful fun and thrilling plot that kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the film
Aug 11 2019,negative,i really didnt like this movie all that well but i mean the only part i really enjoyed was the cat lol and also im just not a marvel fan
Aug 11 2019,negative,i really didnt like this movie all that well but i mean the only part i really enjoyed was the cat lol and also im just not a marvel fan boy 
Aug 11 2019,negative,terrible how fury lost his eye
Aug 10 2019,negative,awful only like the cat and fury the cat and fury earned the movie two stars otherwise the acting was awful the story seemed choppy captain marvel came across as absolutely arrogant not to mention the character was waaaayyy overpowered there wasnt anything unique about the main character that really made her anything worthwhile do not recommend
Aug 10 2019,positive,great film the banter between danvers and fury make this movie worth watching at least twice
Aug 9 2019,negative,a really disappointing experience no interresting journey for the hero no challenge to overcome discrepancies with iron an as shield  is mentioned an obvious political aganda prioritized instead of a good story
Aug 9 2019,negative,one of my least favorite marvel movies thought she was way too powerful and just not one of my favorite super heroes 
Aug 8 2019,positive,captain marvel is arguably the best of the entire marvel series infinity war and doctor strange are the only other two films that even compare
Aug 7 2019,negative,  the movie is more or less has its mistakes the actress is bad is not that i like brie larson because she is a great actress just as captain marvel i do not like if the movie starts boring and ends with a good ending could say but for me its the    worst marvel
Aug 7 2019,negative,meh sums it up perfectly
Aug 7 2019,negative,was kinda of meh especially brie
Aug 7 2019,negative,theres not a lot to redeem this movie it seems to confuse mean with funny and does so repeatedly the main character is unlikable and arrogant which is a bad combination ben mendelsohn steals the show which is how badly the writers portrayed sam jacksons character the action scenes are dimly lit and shake around like the camera man is afraid hell miss something that combined with choppy editing makes them a jumbled mess the skrull makeup is phenomenal though and the plot turn is actually not half bad the tone was very different from other marvel movies and felt much more like jj abrams start trek movies so if you like those movies youre in luck     closest comparison they tried to make wonder woman but made green lantern instead    setting scifi  plot action  tone a messy mess of superhero action and comedy
Aug 7 2019,negative,not a lot of good make nick furry a joke ruined the game changing possibilities of the skrull and all the acting is sub par
Aug 6 2019,negative,so i went into this expecting a great marvel movie what i got was a full 2 hours of crap awful writing unfunny jokes and brie larson bashing men horray 
Aug 6 2019,positive,i like the movie because it had a story  the most recent super hero movies have mostly action and little story due to the movie having so many characters that have to be seen and heard  just a way to make money  captain marvel actually had a story and ideas that were not easily foreseeable  didnt know that cat scratch was coming  totally unexpected  we enjoy this movie  however we know that it is possible to make unrealistic scenes look real by watching the movies world trade center 2006 and star wars 1977  parts of this movie were so fake and cartoonish  even star wars looked real back in nineteen seventyseven  so does most of iron mans flying  captain marvel turning into a cartoon character hurt the movie  the lead actress was very good 
Aug 6 2019,positive,so awesome walked out feeling totally empowered they did justice to my favorite avenger 
Aug 6 2019,negative,not good horrible message and not much plot 
Aug 6 2019,positive,it seemed very true to the source material it was very good
Aug 6 2019,negative,brie larsons potyral of captain marvel was while at times very good in moments at potraying the strong i am female hear me roar type the overall performance was lackluster with her rebel attitude and comedic one liners left much to be desired her role seemed to be written and picked for more of agenda born out of political correctness then what was best for the movie and marvel universe thats not to say a woman is not right for the captain marvel role just not the one in which they picked as for the movie itself was slow and boring the action sequences seemed to almost be an after thought which in turn left you feeling unsatisfied they couldve and shouldve learned a lot as to what a strong female superhero could be from wonder woman but unfortunately they did not the movie ultimately serves necessary to introduce a vital character moving forward in the marvel empire but thats about it you can skip it and not miss a beat with the rest of the franchise moving forward
Aug 5 2019,neutral,quite honestly my main compliant with captain marvel is how boring it is brie larsons a great actress but she wasnt given much to work with in this film very one note monotone skrulls where great though i guess you could see it
Aug 5 2019,positive,the script was funny and refreshing but lacked none of the emotional turmoil of our favourite marvel movies brie larson performed incredibly and the character of captain marvel is an inspiration to women everywhere took marvel long enough but they finally came through with this amazing female lead
Aug 5 2019,positive,i love captain marvel the strongest avenger such a great movie with an excellent story i cant wait to see her lead the mcu in future films 
Aug 5 2019,negative,was far below what i expect from a marvel movie 
Aug 5 2019,positive,great movie funny and entertaining loved it
Aug 5 2019,positive,these marvel movies get super tedious after awhile but i enjoyed this one it got a a little slow towards the end ugh i cant stand the 10 ending movie stylejust end the damn movie my kids 8 and 11 like it my daughter likes it brie larsen is great fun for the whole family 
Aug 5 2019,positive,unpopular opinion unlike what most people think for me this film had everything i want in a marvel movie it had action a great story clever plots and a great twist at the end but what separated this film from the rest was the moral dilemmas now you may be confused by what i mean by this in a film i can only enjoy it if the people who are killed gets avenged as long as they were not already a cold blooded killer for example in many films the protagonist kills several people who did nothing wrong however this is not common in the mcu this movie was great because captain marvel didnt kill anyone so i could still see her as a hero the other thing is that if someone kills innocent people they should be killed unless they had no control of their action this may sound immoral because it is in reality but films are supposed to manipulate your feelings that is the purpose of a film so a film which has the cold blooded killer killed is something which could give you a good vibe for example in the first avengers movie loki murders innocent people but was not killed at the end of the movie this triggered me a little until endgame where he died  in captain marvel the only murderer you directly see is minnerva and the cat the cat is just a cat so you cant really do anything about it and minnerva was killed during the movie which gives the watcher a sense of justice being serverd to the antagonist
Aug 4 2019,neutral,was a bit bland not up to the marvel standards that i come to expect
Aug 4 2019,positive,i feared at first that this was going to be another intergalactic light show of a movie but it in fact turned out to be a delightful and perfectly paced joy throughout on every level
Aug 4 2019,positive,the movie was goodnot as great though but certainly enjoyable with great action and humour
Aug 4 2019,negative,worse by far than any dc film 
Aug 3 2019,positive,fresh up to date fun something where wonder woman should be at 2019 
Aug 3 2019,positive,i see the flaws in this movie but i liked that strong women vibe throughout love brie larson and sam jackson also the 90s music was great brought back so much nostalgia 
Aug 3 2019,positive,great fun action packed movie with feeling  great 90s soundtrack
Aug 3 2019,positive,loved the movie mostly because of nick fury and samuel l jacksons brilliant performance
Aug 3 2019,negative,it is so boring and everything is predictable there werent too many things going on in the movie they just go to different locations and fight thats about it
Aug 3 2019,negative,no character development
Aug 3 2019,positive,the latest mcu movie captain marvel focuses upon carol davors discovery of who she is e exactly all while fighting a war  lead by two alien faction skrulls kree in the mid 90s     the films pacing is somewhat uneven and has a lot of elements it want to exsplore origin story sister hood friendship     the action is decent but not up to the peak of say previous mcu film that doesnt mean its not enjoyable none the less     the cast is outstanding all round over all its an average but fun and entertaining super hero flick
Aug 2 2019,positive,samuel l jackson is just too funny i love him and his movies  captain marvel is a very nice movie didnt for a second predict who the good guys and the bad guys were and who mar vell was if not that i watched the movie
Aug 1 2019,positive,i think it is a good movie brie larson comes of as a bit bland but other than that im exited to see more of her in the mcu
Aug 1 2019,positive,i wasnt too overly impressed with the movie it was an ok storyline and larsons acting felt stiff and almost forced not too sure if she just wasnt as comfortable in her lead role or perhaps she was just written poorly     it lacked the punch and oomph of prior marvel origin stories in my humble opinion but then again i liked the thor movies as hes my favorite avenger and his first two movies didnt blow me away either     id give this movie a c to a b    
Aug 1 2019,positive,captain marvel is absolutely a great excuse to go to the theater during the presummer movie season a man sitting next to my wife fell asleep and started snoring it wasnt me i swear he was obviously only there for his kids but if youre going to fall asleep during a movie do it in your living room captain marvel was not boring in the slightest  it was certainly entertaining enough to keep everyone awake    full review 
Aug 1 2019,negative,the problem with this movie was it was just boring
Aug 1 2019,positive,a good superhero movie but not exceptional i preferred the captain marvel when she was with the cru entity more powerful and interesting story it was interesting to see people from marvel agents of shield tv series taking part in the movie
Aug 1 2019,negative,forced and motivated by ideas not interested in entertaining the viewer avoid
Jul 31 2019,negative,this movie was boring and not needed in the mcu bree larsons acting is stale and she never know what she wants to be the character is just not interesting at all also what is up with the weird use of music most of it was forced such as no doubts im just a girl during a fight scene hitting you right in the nose instead of trying to be subtle overall 25 wouldnt recommend 
Jul 31 2019,negative,great mcu character but very forced acting from larson maybe  next time
Jul 31 2019,negative,initially the movies premise was interesting filled with age old device of potentially and soon enough great herooine but then it gave away with very loose script nd a unmissable political undertone of our times seriously ppl i mean come on its just a superhero movie and cant you keep it that way why making everything political  though you are free to do it and i am free to criticize it the action sequence were not nothing new and with many predictable sequences though new visual effects but i guess thats a standard we can expect from marvel   frankly speaking it would have been great movie provided the script would have been far more tighter with little complexity minus political undertone as end of the day it becomes plainly harebrained with nothing to root for the characters    ps i think thors ragna rock nd winter solider is the best marvel movie 
Jul 31 2019,positive,not really that much packed with humor frankly   overall it was quite a bland experience and the worst moments were those involving the cat and an unrecognizably cringeeliciting nick fury what were they thinking there    denvers herself was the most enjoyable when she was goofydorky much less so when she walked around all wooden and stiff
Jul 31 2019,positive,as a movie in general it was good as a marvel movie it was disappointing
Jul 31 2019,negative,i had high hopes for this movie and was hoping they could leave the culture of 2019 out of the 1990s but they definitely couldnt very cringy movie sam l jackson was awesome as he always is in damn near every single movie he stars in brie larson brings no emotion or depth to the already bland character from the comic book series that has failed more times than almost any other comic i know of  id still recommend seeing it as it is a part of the story just dont expect too much its pretty boring  
Jul 31 2019,positive,one of the best movies of mcu
Jul 31 2019,positive,i really liked the move dispite the hate it has recieved
Jul 31 2019,positive,it was fun to watch but i hate how she god so strong so easily still a good movie tho 
Jul 31 2019,negative,just the worst marvel movie ever
Jul 30 2019,negative,underwhelming is an understatement with this oneits a for the most part bland movie with a blander actress playing the bland main character as an action movie it succeeds but it lacks the charisma that made me fall in love with the marvel cinematic universe in the first place
Jul 30 2019,negative,so lets be fair here people wanted to hate on this movie because its so woke and everything but guess what theres plenty of other stuff to hate this movie is more bland than boiled chicken breast or tuna right out of a can it wasnt necessarily poorly executed but it sure was not the least bit entertaining compared to wonder woman captain marvel herself is not a really compelling character this movie suffers for really only having that film to be compared to when wonder woman is far superior you get to see some real high points as far as marvel lore but it was a bythenumbers snoozefest this is hands down the worst movie marvel has made disguised in neat package that you have to see to understand endgame i guess 
Jul 30 2019,neutral,adequate film but nothing that special acting was a bit stilted and wooden at times
Jul 30 2019,neutral,they let us think that it was the most powerfull superhero in marvel but final we can see only a standard level superhero that is weaker iron man who is humans with no superpower they give us hope of an unstoppable hero and they give us this
Jul 30 2019,positive,this was the first female superhero movie i have ever seen and it was awesome this hero was a more powerful captain than captain america i even liked the skrulls and flerken
Jul 30 2019,negative,this is the most disappointing mcu movie thus far i think would have rather have paid good money to see one of the early 1970s marvel movies instead watching interviews of mcu cast members interaction with brie larson makes me uncomfortable with some of the comments body language and facial expressions it seems like there is just bad chemistry between her and some of the other mcu members i cant say she is a bad actor because i have seen her in a few other films and those roles seeded to be a better fit but the story was somewhat confusing and there was really not a good origin story like some of the other mcu films and her character seem conceited 
Jul 29 2019,positive,i liked the bit when captain marvel blue every thing
Jul 29 2019,positive,samuel l jackson steals the show in brie larsons first outing as captain marvel the mcus first female hero flick is more of a nick fury origin movie introducing his greatest weapon and allie 
Jul 29 2019,negative,oof that was rotten
Jul 29 2019,positive,pretty colors and really cool message about humanities will to keep going no matter the circumstances but was lost because she seemed to be a normal human until she became overpowered and now thats how she solves all her problems there is no development good story to explain who she is though but it was alright
Jul 29 2019,positive,a very well written superhero movie captain marvel is an excellent addition to the mcu and moves the franchise into the next phase postendgame it was enjoyable and refreshing to see the male rescuer trope turned on its head i am the father of 6 boys and we all enjoyed watching brie larsen take no crap from anyone 
Jul 28 2019,positive,as a big marvel fan i had high expectations that were not filled the overall story wasnt bad but didnt give me the excitement i usually feel when i see a mcu film i even fell asleep for a short period of time and thats not good when youre as young as me but overall it was worth it and a very important film to see before endgame i was worried that they were going to cram a lot of feminism down my throat which they did a little and not to be political but i dont like that i still would say it was decently enjoyable
Jul 28 2019,neutral,obviously not the best marvel film but it has its moments didnt really hit me as a fan of marvel though i found it pretty boring at times and just a little dry the fight scenes are ok but the rest is just cliche and mediocre
Jul 28 2019,negative,it was just a very mediocre bland movie with no love or emotion marvel movies have become very formulaic and they all just seem the same this one is especially bad because the story does not feel important and you do not care about the main character its just a bland product a company has put out for consumption with no real direction its not a film but a product  
Jul 28 2019,negative,this movie was soiled by two things its pr being muddied by a socialpolitical diatribe that alienates half of marvels already established audience and hollywoods lack of ambition when writing female protagonists    captain marvels biggest problem was a not having any notable flaws something quite common with how female protagonists are being written today this makes both the story and the character bland and uninteresting    brie larson was clearly directed poorly and given very little to work with from a character pointofview with a face that didnt move for 90 of the movie and a grandiose selfentitled attitude all the while giving the finger to giant number of marvels fan base  brie larson and thus captain marvel came off as largely unlikeable making it hard to route for her in the movie and if her attitude doesnt change and her character becomes more devoid of any discernible emotions shell be hard to route for during the rest of her future in the mcu a massive shame as she has proved herself to be a great and likeable actress in the past  see room and free fire    the overall pros are great cinematography and special effects plus sammy j just about stops it from being the worst movie in the mcu to date maybe im not sure if i prefer this to antman  the wasp yet
Jul 28 2019,negative,okay at best few good scenes but the plot timeline was all over the place 
Jul 28 2019,positive,watched for the first time and was disappointed not in the casting acting humor political messaging or whatever it was the plot the movie was slow and unnecessarily convoluted to the point that my wife and i were questioning each other whats going on and why is this important about 25 minutes in then we both fell asleep at different points a clear sign of pacing issues to me we rallied for the climax but i didnt even want to see anymore as i felt disconnected from the main character i love the mcu and was a comic book fanatic as a kid so my enthusiasm was real and i think the writers really had a nobrainer all things consideredbut like a bottle of soda you open  only once and leave sitting in your car on a hot day the story just seemed flat still can be consumed but its not as enjoyable as it could be ill watch it again to get a better grasp of things but its pretty bad when i learn more about a film reading the synopsis rather than watching it
Jul 27 2019,neutral,it had its funny moments and i liked the story as well as the cgi but no action or suspense just like watching a kid playing with cheats on cs go and turning all them on to full once he gets caught η ηθοποιός ήταν ξινή σαν το λεμόνι captain τυρομούνα
Jul 27 2019,neutral,what i like most was the nostalgia of the 90s and her friend and pilot was the best acting of the movie carol danvers was very bland and over powered leading to her cockiness she was not humble and didnt overcome anything but her memory one of the least memorable marvel heroes 
Jul 27 2019,negative, this movie is so boring       
Jul 27 2019,positive,good story funny and one of the more satisfying endings to a marvel movie yet
Jul 27 2019,positive,its a great movie even though some of the scenes were too dark
Jul 27 2019,negative,its really average not bad not good just average
Jul 27 2019,negative,the action felt really out of place not to metion the sy actress
Jul 27 2019,negative,weak and confusing plot development and heavy on the back story to the detriment of the story flow acting was phoned in 
Jul 26 2019,positive,exactly what youd expect from a marvel movie at this point larson and jacksons chemistry is easily my favorite aspect of the movie 
Jul 26 2019,negative,a good storyline with a lot potential however it falls flat brie larson is miscast in the role ben mendelsohn is fantastic as talos samuel l jacksons nick fury is rather enjoyable to watch in the role but the movie is a disservice to the badass and somewhat takes away from the mystery begun in captain america the winter soldier jude law as yon rogg feels undeveloped as does lashana lynch as maria rambeau its a shame that the first female led marvel cinema universe movie is such a let down and focuses on one of the worse characters from the comics rather than black widow or scarlet witch who undoubtedly deserved it more it will pass the time if you are bored but it falls among the other mcu let downs such as thor the dark world and the incredible hulk
Jul 26 2019,positive,the movie is fine not as bad as some people are making it out to be and not as good as some people are making it out to be the only real problem here is the carols character and the way it was structured i know things are going on with her character but i dont feel invested in her story 
Jul 26 2019,negative,this movie had no emotion no growth and a genuinely cocky interpretation of captain marvel  the reason why characters like captain america iron man and even wonder woman work is because theyre willing to show vulnerability regardless of what gender they are  i genuinely dont care about danvers and i want to root for her with everything this movie is suppose to stand for  brie larson just doesnt work as danvers  i really hope she shows some kind any kind of character growth in her next outing as captain marvel 
Jul 26 2019,negative,the film had a fairly weak plot that revolved more around captain marvel either being held back or pushed down primarily by jude laws character a man or adversely having her spouting out lines relating to her empowerment i have nothing against strong woman in lead roles in my action films i own a bunch of those movies including all of the resident evil movies as well as underworld but those movies actually have a good story to back up their lead characters captain marvel felt like the mcu wanted to push propaganda much more than introduce another well rounded character into the franchise truly disappointing
Jul 25 2019,positive,bland story and forgettable characters not as good as most mcu movies but still better than ironman 3
Jul 25 2019,neutral,it had everything to be one of ucms best and bestpresented films but the main star brie larson didnt know how to give the famous hq character the strength he demanded
Jul 25 2019,negative,pretty boring and the plot was bland but it was funny
Jul 25 2019,negative,captain marvel literally messes with the entire continuity of the mcu and is overall boring and lackluster in many areas its not as bad as darl world but defiantly close 
Jul 24 2019,positive,the problem with captain marvel is not the world story or supporting characters its brie larsons captain marvel who is the most uninspired and onedimensional character in a franchise that usually gets its characters right
Jul 24 2019,negative,i went to the movie with high hopes and was really disappointed my daughter wanted to see it too so we went together when it was over my daughter actually apologized to me when we left the theater besides brie larson being the wrong choice for the character the writing was terrible the action held my attention but by the end i was glad it was over i gave it 2 stars just because its marvel and im a fan of the marvel universe 
Jul 23 2019,positive,after seeing the trailer i wasnt really looking forward to this movie than the audience reviews came out and that didnt help either i ended up not even seeing in the theater and just waited for it to be out on blu ray and boy was i surprised i dont get the hate for this movie what so ever samuel l jackson steals the show as nick fury and the skrulls are a very nice addition i think brie larson did a great job with the material she had and overall i thought this was one of the most interesting mcu movies its not as funny as some other mcu movies but i see that as a good thing it still has a couple of laughs but personally i enjoy a serious superhero movie a lot more
Jul 23 2019,negative,lame   lacks emotion  story line almost completely missing  nice uniforms and the cgi was decent from time to time but thats about it  her super power was to use energy to push people away and fly    sorry i wasted my money
Jul 23 2019,positive,great movie absolutely loved the story beautiful acting and an important part of mcu
Jul 22 2019,positive,i liked it im not sure i understand the criticism i heard before watching this film i heard it wasnt interesting until the last third of the film i disagree with that i heard that bries acting wasnt a good fit i disagree with that as well i thought she did the role justice i also heard that it was heavyladen with overt feminism sermonizing i didnt feel that way at all from what i saw i still have to take some points away for the skrulls they were a bit corny to me
Jul 22 2019,positive,if you have heard bad reviews about the movie see it for yourself if you have seen it and dont like it well perhaps a second more detailed movie might be in order 
Jul 22 2019,neutral,wasnt terrible ben mendelson was good as usual furys scar genesis was stupid and disappointing overall just meh maybe a recast someone who can emote maybe
Jul 22 2019,positive,paint by number but a likable lead even if the hordes consider her captain karen there is hope if more work is put into making us care about danvers as an audience the character needs to be more sympathetic and the villains need to have more resonance    nick fury and his newfound furball relationship is worth the watch alone 
Jul 22 2019,negative,this movie so boring
Jul 22 2019,positive,its a pretty good movie excellent world building prior to the events of the marvel movies main timeline and gives an impactful backstory to carol samual l jackson played comic relief which was infact refreshing to see him lively still however left questions that shouldve been answered unanswered and brie lanson didnt live the role as anticipated good movie tho solid 75 lacks in acting 
Jul 22 2019,negative,so much hype but nothing delivered  without sam l jackson this movie would flop
Jul 21 2019,positive,nice to see a female super hero who was just a super hero without too much dwelling on the fact that shes a woman cgi was good and the deaging post production worked well it was funny when it needed to be i liked the little 90s references and im really pleased we got the origin story to furys eye patch
Jul 21 2019,positive,its a good movie you guys are just misogynistic pieces of garbage
Jul 21 2019,negative,horrible all over the place unoriginal boring most of the time and clearly agenda oriented the whole idea that cm was changed to a woman in the first place was silly and comics fandom already communicated their disappointment many many years ago  this is what happens when agendas override great storytelling and proper origin  its also what happens when you put an actor in a suite that has no business in a lead role at this point in her career  huge comic fan left with heartburn over this one
Jul 21 2019,negative,its ok hard to see where they can go with it kind of hard to create a sense of drama of develop a character arc for someone who is already brilliant at everything and undefeatable also didnt like the use of nick fury just for laughs
Jul 21 2019,positive,despite the fact it has a few flaws here and there i enjoyed it the interplay between the characters throughout was fun as was the ultimate reveal of her true power the ronin retreat was a nice touch not all of the acting was top notch but it was quite entertaining    i dont understand some of the external hate that brie larson gets perhaps some folks are intimidated by strong woman or woman portrayed that way but frankly i didnt care about any of that with respect to this movie not her best acting role but i think that says more about the vehicle than the pilot this movie is an entertainment machine and i think she and the rest of the cast delivered looks like envy has the vegan power now
Jul 20 2019,negative,the worst ever marvel film l ever seen 
Jul 20 2019,positive,a film that has an amazing backstory of carol danvers that leads up to hear being an iconic role in the mcu an amazing twist we have not seen in the mcu before it is truly amazing
Jul 20 2019,positive,the movie was actually amazing im slightly ticked off that people have purposely sabotaged the movie because its supposedly and i quote feminist garbage just because the protagonist is a woman who at times faces problems women often do i adored it and definitely recommend
Jul 20 2019,positive,i went to see this movie after all of the trolling and i thoroughly enjoyed it  it was probably one of the better mcu films produced  the story line was great and the pace of the film was well done  brie larson was great in this
Jul 20 2019,negative,did not expect such a bad movie from marvel and from one called captain marvel at that
Jul 20 2019,negative,brie larson performance was just bland if shes the future leader of the mcu then heres is the fall of mcu well it was great 10 years i enjoyed the throwback themes however not enough to keep me entertain mcu id appreciate a scarlet witch movie 
Jul 20 2019,negative,watched it twice only good part were talos and nick fury
Jul 20 2019,positive,captain marvel is a fun movie overall i had trouble with brie larsons performance of carol danvers though which is a problem considering she is the main lead the flipping between  i am a badass and i dont need anyone tone and i am sensitive and confused got draining to the point where i wanted her to stick to a personality instead of trying to so hard to be cool and relatable the supporting cast was spot on with amazing performances by samuel l jackson and ben mendelsohn though so this movie is redeemable with the surrounding efforts fun but overall a decent marvel movie 355
Jul 20 2019,positive,one of my favorite marvel movies fun but never taking itself too seriously
Jul 20 2019,neutral,after hearing the reviews and watching larsons grandstanding interviews i had no interest in seeing this  but i had a chance to see this for free so why not  it wasnt as bad as some of the reviewers had suggested but it wasnt anything special either  there was a bit of girl power men are bad in there as the trailers suggested but it wasnt actually that significant  the visuals are decent and the action is ok  most of the issue with this movie is around the plot and larsons acting  she almost seemed to be like a member of the audience trapped in the movie cracking jokes for no apparent reason  the movie does not appear to affect her all that much  and why should it  the plot is almost incomprehensible  there are some space politics going on and there are some good guys that are bad and vis versa  both sides do bad things until the movie finally decides which side is good and then plays up a bunch of interstellar refugees looking for a warp drive that i am not sure why they need because the jump drive tech already exists  whatever  anyway younger versions of colson and fury are in this for mcu continuity i guess  they dont really add anything to the plot such as it is  
Jul 19 2019,negative,ammmh yeah flop fest
Jul 19 2019,positive,great movie im just annoyed shield calls themselves shield when in iron man years later phil coulson says were working on a name
Jul 19 2019,positive,captain marvel is a funny great action franchise 
Jul 19 2019,negative,there was nothing about this movie that actually made me root for the protagonist additionally i think this movie suffered from the superman problem when you have a hero who is almost completely invincible and ridiculously powerful it is very difficult to come up with a compelling reason to think that there life is in danger one of the major problems in this movie is there was nothing happening that really made me question the safety of the protagonist this felt like more of an origin story of nick furys messed up eye than a captian marvel movie for this to be the first mcu heroine to get a solo movie they did not make this a worthwhile and memorable movie  
Jul 19 2019,negative,weak movie political casting and an unnecessary movie to add to the marvel franchise
Jul 19 2019,negative,so boring and predictable  my wife fell asleep in the middle  brie larson was bland at best  not one of marvels best for sure
Jul 19 2019,negative,this was marvels answer to wonder woman    just like in the past 5 decades of comic books marvel doesnt seem to understand the difference between females with powers and female empowerment it took marvel those 50 years to drag the character of carol danvers through a lot of misogynistic junk    beginning her comic life as the original captain marvels love interest carol danvers was empowered in a way that only white boy comic geeks would consider logical shes kinda smarter than other girls in comics when danvers did receive superpowers it was not as the successor to captain marvel but as ms marvel she was strong she could fly and she was given what could only be called a bathing suit as a costume google ms marvel 1970s and you will see what marvel artists and editors considered empowerment the following 40 years would see danvers loose her powers to the then villain rogue only to gain new nuclear powers a short time later the new powers came with even less of a costume google binary costume 1980s    in the 90s she got her old powers back along with what can only be described as a superhero fashion homage to jazzercise the kicker being that even then danvers was hung with the ms marvel title again    it wouldnt be until the 2010s that the character would receive the title of captain    this history seems to have saddled the creators and producers of this movie to the point of paralysis 19 movies into the mcu and there were no female headliners this may be because marvel comics has never really backed titles with women as central figures so they really dont have much source material to pull from but apparently the best a whole bunch of writers and producers could come up with is that they would make captain marvel the most powerful superhuman by desexualizing the character one could make the argument disney still hasnt made an mcu movie with a female headliner    it is not fair to compare this movie to wonder woman 2017 but the latter does illustrate how heroic femininity can not only be different but in a lot of ways better it wasnt just that gal gadots charisma permeates every frame shes in but that the writers and director allowed gadots diana to be a women wonder woman was driven as much by her feelings of love and maternity as she was by any notion of justice    if you ask me the biggest advantage that the dceu has over the mcu juggernaut pun intended is that the filmmakers are steering the ship for the most part whereas the mcu is now in fullblown formula mode sure the dceu movies have had consistency problems while marvel is just printing money but this captain marvel movie should have been a statement movie for women filmmakers as much as black panther was for african american ones    its not not by a long shot    maybe brie larson isnt capable of the emoting necessary to convey the complexity of a strong yet still feminine hero i dont think so she really did earn that oscar in room 2016 its just a really confusing script not intricate confusing more like loopy and disjointed confusing no one has any real motivation and the whole thing moves forward through montage instead of any solid story arcs the movie ends up being a series of scenes in which captain marvel gets more powers    the dialog is more stilted than the other mcu movies which is saying something the only person able to make hay of their role is samuel l jackson who seems to be loving that he gets paid a hell of a lot of money for making these movies everyone else however seem not to know when to hit their cues or understand sight lines when they are obviously the only actor present in a room of nothing but green as a result larson does a lot posing while she looks over the shoulders of the audience the normally solid jude law and annette bening both come across as wet blankets thrown on top of a recently thawed stack of wholeturkey breasts    so there you go weak plot pointless action wishywashy acting and a lot of wasted energy and talent seriously if you skip any marvel this should be the first on your list followed by spiderman homecoming and the incredible hulk    and it breaks my heart to say that
Jul 19 2019,negative,the most boring character i ve seen in mcu movie not worth any attention and money
Jul 18 2019,negative,one of the first movies which i felt the actress hated comics fans and especially the character she playedwooden performance
Jul 18 2019,negative,one of the worst films ive ever seen in my life horribly boring drivel
Jul 18 2019,negative,shallow superficial crap that is trying to push sjw agenda
Jul 17 2019,positive,its good i dunno why people sledged it i gave it a miss and then came back around when i saw a youtube recap of the story good for an evening viewing for sure
Jul 17 2019,positive,loved it i watched two times
Jul 17 2019,negative,abysmal in every respect
Jul 17 2019,negative,movie as a whole feels like another lazy and predictable mcu origin story  might have felt more original if it had come out a few years earlier but a slew of earlier mcu movies wearing down the same tired formula has rendered this film a mediocre and forgettable mess  casting larson also seemed like a poor choice a cardboard cutout that just reads the lines
Jul 17 2019,negative,brie larson was the wrong actor for the roll
Jul 17 2019,positive,one of the weaker marvel movies with bad acting from brie larson but a fun story from all of the other parts some lines are a bit cheasey but they work
Jul 16 2019,negative,this was so so not as good to live up the hype brie larsons acting wasnt that good either watched it for mcu among mcu movies this was by far the worst even thor dark world had better moments
Jul 16 2019,negative,to quote gene from the emoji movie meh
Jul 16 2019,negative,brie larsons boring romp felt like slogging through mud while someone shouted their agenda in your face the people behind this obviously felt like their fans werent worth the listen to because they seemed to go out of their way to attack them especially with scenes where the main character physically assaults people for asking her to smile a common complaint from the fanbase about brie larsons acting    the story was built around a lot of extremely overused tropes like the memory loss of a superpowerful character that would give way to her suddenly going all powerful at the end in what was supposed to be an exciting power reveal scene but ended up with captain marvel doing some regular fighting stuff with energy blasts and one of the most cringeworthy songs ever in the background a song which continued to beat the viewers with the agenda which was the crux of the entire movie brie larsons character is unlikable except for a few moments when shes working with nick fury samuel l jackson which also seem to be the moments when the character has a single emotion this is especially funny because the main villain keeps telling her that she needs to control her emotions more despite her complete lack of any    sadly the movie also suffered from brie larsons inability to shut up and just do her job her regular attacks on the fans who criticized the movie and consistently politicizing the movie in a way which polarized and divided the fanbase rather then bringing them all together gave this movie a bad flavor     in the end this movie makes the same mistake as what so many movies do it pushes an agenda but forgets that an agenda isnt the entire foundation of good writing i saw a lot of female empowerment messages and lots of feminist messages and even some messages about refugees but these were wrapped in the brownpaper bag of stories check it out if you want to keep up on who this character is in endgame but dont go in expecting anything special
Jul 16 2019,negative,alright lets be honest this movie was horrible i was shocked myself since bri larson did an amazing job in room that won her the oscar also surprised because this is a marvel movie the acting wasnt even good felt like bri larson was reading her script for the first time the plot was horribly done the scenes they decided to put were disappointing its like they expected the audience to have some knowledge about bri larsons character beforehand everything was too fast paced you could predict what could happen nothing special i expected much more very disappointing
Jul 16 2019,positive,doesnt deserve the hate its been givenits a good movie and a solid addition into the mcu  ratings76
Jul 15 2019,negative,horrible  soooo boring  one day captain boring is whiny and complaining  the next day she is flying through everything without any flaws or weaknesses  ughhsmh
Jul 15 2019,negative,relatively boring over done super hero movie with an unenthusiastic and drab lead actor
Jul 15 2019,positive,i believe screen junkies put it best this is a phase one movie in a phase three world this is the first marvel film in a while that felt that the direction was faceless where the russos waititi gunn coogler and even reed among others shined fleck and bodens direction felt fairly faceless as the film comes off as just another marvel outing however its not without its charm the visuals are stellar to look at and the makeup on the fanfavorite skrulls is a sight for sore eyes the performances by jackson and mendelssohn are fantastic but the movie wouldnt be anything without its leading lady brie larson turns is a fine performance and its great to see this character finally integrated into the mcu however shes given very little to work with and theres not much that truly distinguishes her yet thats not the fault of larson just a writing and direction problem the film is a fine spectacle and a nice solo venture but theres just not much originality that weve seen with the past slate of marvel films
Jul 15 2019,positive,this movie gets way too much hate its a fun ride and samuel l jackson is the best part of this movie no doubt
Jul 15 2019,positive,loved this movie powerful messages for young girls and a brilliant performance by one of my favourite actresses
Jul 15 2019,negative,cheap acting directingjust was yawning my way through the movie cause i cant believe i freaking paid to watch this crap
Jul 15 2019,negative,such a boring movie you dont have to see this movie
Jul 15 2019,negative,the best part was the cat
Jul 15 2019,positive,i feel like it got a bad rap i love movies that are fun and dont take themselves too seriously i also loved the message it had about being confident in yourself and embracing your strengths too often i see people especially women downplaying their strengths to be polite or make others comfortable good if you enjoy it for what it is and not what its loosely based on
Jul 14 2019,negative,confused and a little boring
Jul 14 2019,positive,captain marvel is honestly a great movie with great plot and awesome characters who do get the chance to develop throughout the movie and watch certain actors in the movie take on different genre of film the costume department did a great job on showcasing 90s era outfits and styles and kudos to the music department on showcasing music that really played well with the plot of the movie 1010 would watch again would recommend 
Jul 14 2019,positive,i really enjoyed the story line and many of the surprises through out the film
Jul 14 2019,positive,it was pretty good but not as good as all the other movies but it did provide background for the next avengers movie which was good since i didnt read comics as a child
Jul 14 2019,positive,this movie full on was amazing there were some scenes that were so powerful they left me in tears a beautiful introduction for the character 
Jul 14 2019,positive,when i saw the movie in the cinema i enjoyed it i didnt think too much about everything so i enjoyed it it was a shame to see so many men and even some women bash this movie just for having a female lead but oh well i guess the dialogue felt cheesy at some points but overall was good my only complaint is the storyline which is kind of a big one she didnt have any flaws and anything which could be perceived as one isnt at no point does she have to overcome her flaws or use it to her advantage i wish the scene between cm and whatever character jude law plays was instead done with neither of them having their powers it would hark back to the training scene between them and show that cm didnt need to rely on her powers which she does in this movie also the soundtrack at some points was a bit eh but overall i enjoyed it and while most people critiques are genuine ones rather than just being sexist its a real shame to see so many people judge the movie on either brie larson or it being the first mcu movie with a female lead as for the future of the character i hope they take her in the way some comics have as in her not being a 100 good guy and very much swaying between whats right and isnt that could be cool
Jul 14 2019,positive,this movie was absolutely amazing
Jul 14 2019,positive,this was fine it was cool to see kind of the beginning story of fury  the avengers initiative but other than that this movie was just okay i wasnt blown away or emotionally attached to any of the characters  the story was predictable not a bad flick but i probably wont watch it again
Jul 14 2019,positive,one of the best marvel movies ive seen 
Jul 14 2019,positive,samuel jackson and jude law saved this movie without them it would have been easily forgettable this is the only mcu movie i have not watched a 2nd time or more brie larson is just not very good in the role i would have loved to see a better suited talent to the role she just comes off as arrogant and obnoxious i consider this more of a nick fury and phil coulson movie
Jul 14 2019,negative,one of the worst marvel movies 
Jul 13 2019,positive,brie got better as the story progressed another marvel movie that could have been cut 20 minutes or more
Jul 13 2019,negative,okay movie at best the film introduced one of the most fearsome and devastating foes from the comics the skrull although there introduction to the mcu was interesting at best the portrayal that they received was almost benevolent which is completely incorrect for the villains that inspire an entire comic arc the movie also was supposed to be a transition and introduction into endgame and the plot of the movie fell flat with its connections to this idea  
Jul 13 2019,negative,worst of the marvel universe  too little too late compared to the other movies 
Jul 13 2019,negative,i went in excited as im a big mcu fan but i left disappointed in the overall story  ronan was again irrelevant jude law was underwhelming and brie was simply not capable of expressing the emotion needed for the role  i blame a poor script and a poor directors team for not getting the job done
Jul 13 2019,negative,i really want to know the reason why they cased this very bad actress packed with humor  not really the only funny scene for me is with nick fury jude law is deffinitely a talented actor but not here his character is boring but i must say the design and costume of minnerva looks good
Jul 13 2019,negative,no stakes when your character is a godnick fury was unfunnypredictible as shitalways getting told she is the bestthe scene we met her friend she crys cause vers does not remember her and besides a couple flashback scenes i did not give a shit what was going onthe cree is the worst marvel villain sense the dark elves310 dont see it
Jul 13 2019,positive,this movie feels like a big hug everytime i watch it carol danvers is the hero ive always needed she reminds us all that our humanity is always what makes us strong the movie is action packed full of comedy and fun for all the family the buddy cop relationship between carol and fury is awesome and hilarious the relationship between carol and maria is the kind of relationship we need to see more often on screen between two female characters the movie is slow paced at first but its with good reason that it is it builds up to an amazing fight scene at the end and a really amazing message about strength resilience and humanity its a must see 
Jul 13 2019,negative,worst movie in the marvel franchise
Jul 13 2019,positive,i loved it  but i hate when people give review for this movie just because an actor said something wrong reviews should be given for the movie  not for the actor
Jul 13 2019,negative,compared to the other films in the mcu this film does not live up to what it is a part of
Jul 13 2019,positive,an okay movie but not one of the better mcu films brie larson does not fit well as an actress in the role the movie has a somewhat laughable plot line although the action was good in some parts it got confusing and i think they tried to do too much
Jul 13 2019,neutral,eh disappointing for recent marvel movies
Jul 13 2019,positive,the first 13 made me wonder but this really picked up and was actually better than i thought it would be a very solid marvel origin movie
Jul 13 2019,negative,terrible acting by brienot even worth mentioning name
Jul 12 2019,neutral,this was not very good lacked humor but still had decent action
Jul 12 2019,negative,this movie is incredibly boring and screams sjw brie larson was poorly cast for the role and carol danvers has quite literally no personality anytime she faces a challenge its not really a challenge she has no weaknesses nothing makes you empathize with her at all she has no character development and neither does anyone else in this movie the plot is garbage as well you can use the coveted mcu signature formula but you have to at least make the plot make sense every other mcu movie is better than this one by far
Jul 12 2019,negative,wow im really disappointed in everyone rating this higher than a one star ive never been bored in a marvel film until now wow so terrible  1 whats with the english cockney accent youll understand when you hear it  2 what is exactly the plot extraordinarily stretched out garbage  3 when the comic relief is a cat a cgi cat no less you know youre struggling  4 whats with the english cockney accent
Jul 12 2019,positive,another great entry into the mcu fond memories from the 80s have this films little more depth stan lee cameo was one of his best
Jul 12 2019,negative,this shit was pretty trash ngl
Jul 12 2019,positive,a bit slow at the start some scenes drag on a bit too long and its just lacking sharpness generally decent enough movie entertaining but not exceptional
Jul 12 2019,positive,i dont think people give this movies plot twist enough credit it caught me off guard in a franchise that never does and i like it more now after the end of spiderman far from home further fleshed out its implications for the mcu its about averageslightly above average mcu film like an ant man or dr strange but thats not a bad thing far from it the mcu is just really good overall 
Jul 12 2019,negative,this movie was so underwhelming captain marvel is one of the most interesting and powerful characters in the marvel universe yet the film came across as boring and annoying there is no reason to be emotionally engaged or attached to captain marvel as she has little to no personality furthermore the whole film seems to be an over the top feminist propaganda story people come to watch superhero movies for escapism and politicising films if its essential to the film is fine if its essential to the plot ie a suffragettes movie but in captain marvels case it comes across as forced and repetitive the only saving graces of this movie are nick fury who provides all the comedy and heart that carol danvers doesnt and the postcredit scene which is a nice teaser for endgame even if she played little part in the film 
Jul 11 2019,positive,second only to wonder woman for best superhero movie
Jul 11 2019,positive,spacethemed superhero action thats reminiscent of guardians of the galaxy minus the wealth of charisma and the groovy wellplaced musical cues captain marvel tries to carve its own little niche in that last respect with a heavy load of popular 90s radio hits spewed all over the place but they feel far less curated and personal in a few important scenes such heavyhanded soundtrack choices actually detract from the action rather than enhancing it    the captain herself former test pilot carol danvers is reserved and composed by design a different cut from the brash marvel template that takes inspiration from her military upbringing and fits her eventual role as a sort of galactic peace officer this makes for a less colorful lead than weve been conditioned to expect from the mighty megafranchise and i can understand how that might rub a few fans the wrong way personally i didnt have an issue so long as we were slowly unraveling the tangled threads of her origin story but shell need to find a richer supporting cast to thrive in future solo outings    lighter fare than i was expecting and rather small in scale despite the veiled implications of a longrunning interstellar war its throwback setting places this film in a unique position to explore and enrich the stories of several mcu playthings  fury the tesseract ronan the kree  but even with those little curiosities the whole thing feels a tad unnecessary
Jul 11 2019,positive,outstanding artistry in every aspect of this film  its definitely a winner   one of my alltime favorites 
Jul 11 2019,positive,only reason this doesnt have a higher score is because some sexist users reviewed it poorly before it even came out to try and make it tank 
Jul 11 2019,negative,movie was okay wasnt an overwhelming political agenda and the acting was very well done brie larson and sam l jackson had good chemistry throughout and their scenes together were enjoyable unfortunately the 2nd third of the movie was very slow and uneventful but my biggest issue with the movie was the unnecessary tie ins with other movies in the mcu without giving too much away we learn things that one nobody was asking for and two the answers are more of a disservice and disrespectful to fans of both the comics and mcu as a whole the source of captain marvels power seems to break the timeline of an important item in the mcu and theres little to no character arc in her story this would have been a great movie if it was by itself but because of its influence on a greater universe of connected movies it made me more upset at betrayed than entertained
Jul 11 2019,positive,this is probably one of the only marvel films i have scored the lowest  overall its not a bad movie  they did a good job of bringing these characters to life  however  i gotta be a fanboy and say that i wasnt happy with the fact that they changed a lot of the source material for the film  also not thrilled with the fact that marvel studios is trying to make her the strongest one in the movies when shes not  anyone who knows these characters from the books knows that shes no where near as strong as the hulk or even thor  those two alone out power her by a huge margin  but like i said over all not a bad film  was definitely better than wonder woman
Jul 11 2019,negative,nope go watch alita much better
Jul 11 2019,negative,a very poor job from the studios on the storyline the movie is boring i mean really boring its just a chracter introduction stretched too long thats all its way better to watch the trailer than the movie
Jul 11 2019,positive,as a movie its fine but as a marvel movie its nothing short of a disappointment captain marvel had all of the elements to make a great film but throws those elements away during the second act
Jul 11 2019,negative,samuel jackson was as always epic lots of great actors script seemed kinda forced and brie larson seemed stiff and not as strong of a personality as captain marvel was in the comics she was beautiful and graphics makeup costumes were spot on 
Jul 10 2019,positive,as always a good movie from marvel most of all pleased samuel l jackson ben mendelsohn and of course goose
Jul 10 2019,negative,i did not care about the people in the movie only the cat
Jul 10 2019,negative,so boring i turned it off with 30 minutes left to go to sleep  i remembered 3 weeks later i had never finished it and watched the end  only so i could say i saw the whole thing
Jul 10 2019,positive,editing aside the movie soars with a hero discovering her roots as she attempts to recover memories there is fine acting and great visual throughout 
Jul 10 2019,positive,it was fine could have been better though i feel like there is some lost potential here it passed the time and had some cringe music cues but the tunes were fun ones
Jul 10 2019,negative,a film too loose and boring with a captain marvel that does not catch anyones attention
Jul 10 2019,negative,i would not see the movie againg
Jul 9 2019,negative,capitan marvel cares only for herself thinks shes super powerful but cant even defeat thanos she never sacrificed her life for the people which is what super heros do shes not a really super hero
Jul 9 2019,negative,garbage politics in children movies what a total disgrace shame
Jul 9 2019,negative,this film has far too much focus on identity politics and not enough on the story many of the male characters were underused with nick fury one of the greatest marvel characters ever in particular being used as a thirdrate comic relief 
Jul 9 2019,negative,as in many movies the comic books are way better but this one is just off the mark from taking both the name and powers of a better character in monica rambeau to making the skrulls so weak
Jul 9 2019,negative,disappointing very disappointing i expected much from captain marvel and though it certainly had its moments and aspects of excellence the film flattered to deceive both in context of the mcu and as a standalone film it felt like a marvel phase 1 film but without the naive brilliance of iron man 1 or captain america the first avenger it felt more like thor the dark world in terms of quality and almost dclike in terms of its treatment of the source material quite frankly the treatment of one of marvel comics most heralded antagonist groups the skrulls is unforgivable and the writing of the eponymous character left a lot to be desired which is a shame for brie larsson who was a lot better in endgame despite her short air time before i elaborate i want to be clear these are spoilers so only read on if you have seen captain marvel    the skrulls are major antagonists in marvel lore the kreeskrull war is well known to even casual comic readers to the extent that only one portrayal of the skrulls would have reasonably been expected evil that they spent half the film depicting the skrulls as bad only to pivot the storyline rather abruptly is all the more galling in that it felt as though they were getting the right treatment only to have that rug pulled unceremoniously pandering to the increasingly pc brigade and in what can only be described as an attempt to capitalise on populist rhetoric at the moment the skrulls were shown to be refugees seeking asylum rather than the shapeshifting infiltrators who have brought down entire worlds in the comics whilst ben mendelsohns talos was arguably a film highlight that does little to paper over the cracks of what felt like odious puffery to lefty commentators seeking more inclusion and diversity this can technically be salvaged if talos and his renegade group of refugees are shown to be a small group of separatists breaking away from the more common deceptive skrulls however if anyone as seen spider man far from home hope for that might be lost    captain marvel herself was also very poorly written in her scenes with yonrogg jude law she is lambasted for apparently being too emotional whilst appearing utterly devoid of it as a trope it makes sense and it is clear that the kree do not want her to fully repair her faculties which are linked to emotion however they write the words without then writing her character with any emotion at all they make her totally robotic and wooden and this is far more an issue of script writing than performance as where the script lent itself to emotion brie excelled she had few moments to shine but her performances opposite samuel l jacksons nick fury lashana lynchs maria rambeau and akira akbars monica rambeau were emotional warm funny and otherwise engaging so it is clearly not an issue with brie larsson as an actor and much to do with poor scriptwriting     i havent even talked about how ridiculously overpowered captain marvel was in the film i could almost write an essay about how much of a plot hole that is but in all honestly if you have seen endgame you will see how much of an issue it creates captain marvel barely features at all because if she did there would simply be no endgame  she would end it in 2 minutes once she goes binary she is impervious all powerful and completely infallible its not like there is an off switch a weakening agent or a time limit on how long she can stay binary once she achieves it she can just plough through absolutely anything how can any character possess that kind of power and be interesting     honestly it was disappointing on so many levels but i would like to point out that nick fury is a massive highlight as was seeing phil coulson again on screen there were great scenes between fury and danvers but overall the film let me down in a way no marvel film has done since thor dark world as much as i felt black panther was overrated and rather poor on the whole this was a new level more holes than swiss cheese and i cannot see how they plan to bring this character back to some kind of believability even superman had kryptonite perhaps they wish to use her to battle galactic forces like galactus but it will start veering towards ridiculousness and will ultimately lose the audience as cgi will take over and practical effects become impossible    by all means watch the film you have to if you are a marvel fan but dont way i didnt warn you
Jul 9 2019,negative,worst mcu ever this movie was a waste of time and money
Jul 9 2019,negative,from beginning to end i had absolutely no idea what was going on it jumps all over the place and the plot i could latch onto was formulaic and cliche what kind of super hero is named carol also and also she wore a nine inch nails shirt most of the film and she does not look like a nin fan honestly what the hell was it even about or am i just dumb idk 
Jul 9 2019,negative,one of the most bland movies in thebes entirety of the mcu the movie repeatedly talked about carol keeping her emotions in check and i constantly would ask myself what emotions  shes too much a godly being to be a good hero and good person shes boring rude pretentious and a cocky snob  hero she thinks too highly of pf heralded even before she got unleashed her new powers which only ionflayed her every growing ego instead of using her skills and brain she uses her pioneers to find every problem she faces what kind of message a that just break your way through your problems overall meh movies that i will never watch again i was hoping for something good and received a steamigg pile of garbage 
Jul 9 2019,negative,trash dont waste your money
Jul 8 2019,negative,i just really didnt like this movie  i kept waiting to care about the charactersbut both the script and the dry acting were flat
Jul 8 2019,positive,i loved her personality she was all messed up by kree but her humanity came thru and probably continues to grow as more movies come out fun too in short
Jul 8 2019,negative,broke down and finally watched it terrible movie  choppy no character development
Jul 8 2019,negative,easily one of the worst of the films in the marvel cinematic universe   underplayed unoriginal boring cgi and story too much nostalgia and universe building and a underperforming lead actor      i cant really get into more details because it is such a forgettable film 
Jul 8 2019,negative,some rare funny or entertaining moments i guess but this is mostly a bad 2 hour long propaganda movie with no subtlety at all 5 writers to get a bad story bad characters and a bad movie 
Jul 8 2019,neutral,it was decent there is not much good or bad about this movie i did really like the retro aesthetic of the movie when the story was taking place on earth a problem i had was that carol was changing personality back and forth from being quite stoic and alien to being very witty it was like seeing two different interpretations of the same character    its worth a watch if you like superhero movies but its forgettable compared to other movies in the same genre
Jul 8 2019,positive,brie larson spearheads this epic adventure that introduces the first female solo superhero film in the mcu well done
Jul 8 2019,neutral,not really understanding if im being honest  they should have just told more about her past in the beginning and then went into the flash backs later  still i did enjoy watching some what  wouldnt watch again tho 
Jul 8 2019,negative,onedimensional heroine boring and unoriginal plot terrible twist captain marvel lacks everything that has been making marvel films great over the past few years
Jul 8 2019,positive,i remember when i watched it in the cinema i felt awkward by her wit acting and her feminism character since im the person who laugh loudly and easily i laughed awkwardly when i watch it but other characters were good at their acting and brought the story to a three level stars i hope larson learn how to act funny naturally thor movies were like that too and third thor movie is the best of them
Jul 8 2019,neutral,an unoriginal plot and a predictable message doesnt help prepare us for the final chapter of the infinity saga
Jul 7 2019,positive,its not the start i wished for one of the most powerful humans in the mcu brie larson doesnt do a lot to make me believe in her character the movie is decent but a disappointment of what it could of been for a origin story
Jul 7 2019,neutral,it was ok not great nothing special just watch it because its apart of the mcu i did like brie larson in this but the movie was very dull 
Jul 7 2019,negative,how about we dont push an agenda in a superhero movie that focuses on entertaining audiences
Jul 7 2019,neutral,fun at times but generally a badly written and bland movie with an underdeveloped protagonist devoid of charisma about as rewatchable as the dark world for me though having loki makes tdw a bit better hope carol is improved on in the future
Jul 7 2019,negative,bottom of the ranks for marvel movies the delivery from brie larson is sad to say the least poorly cast the character development is also sad to say the least there is zero connection between captain marvel and viewers because she doesnt actually have to work for anything she has while the deliveries from fury talos and goose the cat were nice i wouldnt suggest this movie and wont be following the character in the future if you havent seen this watch anything else please not indicative of typical marvel works
Jul 6 2019,negative,felt like it was made for 15 year olds
Jul 6 2019,neutral,great ideas  bad execution carol danvers character was extremely flat the whole time which i think contributed to most of the failure of the movie other than that the idea and story line was really cool visual stuff was cool too 
Jul 6 2019,negative,started off ok then went down the  stupid path as most of these do now of days   
Jul 6 2019,negative,so boring the storyline is just not exciting and they make captain marvel look so dull and plain and just not what it ought to make her the most powerful superhero 
Jul 5 2019,positive,brie larson does a great job of conveying a character who got caught in an explosion was brainwashed and kidnapped and is taught that emotions are a distraction loved the 90s vibe and very impressed overall
Jul 5 2019,positive,the nostalgia was great i went into it with very very low expectations due to the reviews and was pleasantly surprised funny action packed worth the see in spite of the politics behind people not being a fan of brie
Jul 5 2019,positive,this movie was a letdown  maybe thats because marvel had it so overhyped that it couldnt possibly reach those expectations or maybe its just because this movie is a forgettable experience  i think the main issue is how unlikable carol danvers is  shes literally the worst in the comics and she isnt much better here  cocky overconfident and a bit rude she really isnt a good protagonist and she doesnt change by the end of the film  the story is even a little meh and the only working part of this movie is nick fury and maybe the skrulls  otherwise its a passable movie since she isnt prominent in endgame  nothing important happens here just know she is overpowered  
Jul 5 2019,positive,unquestionably a top 5 marvel film larson is a supernova
Jul 5 2019,positive,one of the best in the entire marvel volume
Jul 4 2019,negative,this is not worthy of a  78 rating it is horrible if you liked this movie then you should stop reviewing movies now brie is bad and sam  i am the same in every moviewhich is getting years ago 
Jul 4 2019,negative,serioulsy bad casting was looking for a new fresh and heroic series found a running joke of sitcom slapstick fit for a 3rd tier canadian public tv show 
Jul 4 2019,positive,one of the weaker marvel movies but still decent
Jul 4 2019,negative,boring lack of emotion from main character being a strong woman doesnt mean you have to be stoic missed opportunity here
Jul 4 2019,neutral,when i first saw this movie in theaters i loved it but after rewatching it a few times it seems that the movie has one major disadvantage it came out between avengers infinity war and endgame overall its better than most marvel solo movies but suffers when compared to movies like guardians and the avengers 
Jul 4 2019,negative,the action and banter between captain marvel and nick fury are really fun and enjoyable but the film doesnt really have that much flair or excitement to it and just feels kinda bland brie larson is an incredible actress but shes told to play captain marvel as low key as possible and just comes across as not that interesting were told who she is rather than shown who she is 
Jul 4 2019,positive,by far the least impressive movie of the series very corny oversaturated with an over the top female empowerment theme really took away from the hero and the predictable storyline 
Jul 4 2019,neutral,is it a terrible movie  nah  is it a feminist film that people were worried about  no  is it a good and entertaining movie  absolutely not  i actually think i enjoyed thor the dark world over this movie  sure the film is more than passable but definitely one of the worst mcu films
Jul 4 2019,negative,terrible waste of time
Jul 3 2019,neutral,the action scenes and the interaction between captain marvel and nick fury are really enjoyable but the film doesnt really have a flare or style and feels kind of bland and boring its a movie not bad not great perfectly average
Jul 3 2019,negative,i was looking forward to this movie having seen what brie larson can do in room when matched with the indie directing duo of boden and fleck but the screenplay lets the talents down with a hollow onedimensional character for a movie about selfdiscovery this completely lacks the hero journey thats essential for any hero introduction essentially she just remembers something and gets more powerful no sense of peril danger or actual stakes a deus ex machina device in the making
Jul 3 2019,positive,it wasnt so good i wouldnt rewatch it but it was an enjoyable experience
Jul 3 2019,positive,my favorite marvel hero so far i now have a huge giant crush for brie  the movie kept me on the edge of my seat it just checked all the boxes of what i feel a great movie should be i cannot wait for the next captain marvel sequel
Jul 2 2019,positive,i thought this film was awesome super funny great action and a really badass main lead
Jul 2 2019,negative,why o why  talk about over powered felt like i was watching a top gun wanna be movie
Jul 2 2019,negative,brie larsons acting is uneven and unsteady while the best part of this movie is the cgi cat that honestly made the movie worse in the scheme of things i will see nick furys deaged face was a good part about this movie im glad that endgame did not show captain marvel as much because as entertaining as this movie was its not much else
Jul 2 2019,positive,interesting plot twist
Jul 2 2019,negative,lots of overacting  to the point that it was distracting  ben mendelsohn did a nice job  plot was a bit thin as well  
Jul 2 2019,negative,kind of boring and captain marvel is way too op you cant have a character that powerful and basically invincible theres no suspense or drama then they dialed her power way back for end game very weird dynamic in play
Jul 2 2019,negative,the movie is complete flop the story is dull and her empowered attitude is like a bad smell that you cant ignore im so glad they kept her presence to a minimum in avengers end game
Jul 2 2019,neutral,captain marvel is disappointing in setting an origin story for the new face of the mcu and in setting up the future of the franch
Jul 2 2019,negative,boring story line i gave it a chance but it sucks i gave it a chance but literally fell asleep more than 3 times not worth renting wait till it hits netfliz
Jul 1 2019,negative,i probably would have liked the movie more if there was a more charismatic lead by the end of the movie i get the feeling captain marvel is more of an ahole then a super hero  i am also not a fan of tokenization  of heros to fit a quota on sex or race which is the case here more heros should be made to even the field and more focus and more effort to improve current minority heros or lgbt heros stop tokenizing current heros
Jul 1 2019,positive,captain marvel is fine its a barebones cosmic origin story with most of the hallmarks of a classic mcu movie present throughout
Jul 1 2019,negative,this movie was alright i didnt really like it my favorite part was all the goose parts i would definitely not watch it again ill give this an f
Jul 1 2019,positive,i read the reviews and along with me being tired with the very generic superhero movies coming out didnt think i would like this movie i am annoyed that i did not watch this sooner this movie is wonderful i dont know why people are calling her a bad actor do you call the other male actors in the other mcu movies bad she did just as well and i loved it
Jul 1 2019,positive,i didnt expect to like this film as much as i did while not an amazing story the film is a lot of fun and brie larson seems a good fit for the character while not the best mcu film id say its in the top 50 
Jul 1 2019,positive,i just dont understand the hate for this movie just because it has a female protagonist doesnt mean she has to be charming and kind i liked that about the movie and brie larson portrayed it well it has a slow first 20 minutes but when she teams up with nick fury thats where the fun starts i loved it and absolutely recommend it also dont listen to most reviews because most are haters with multiple accounts
Jul 1 2019,positive,great movie entertaining amazing production dont understand why there is so much criticism 
Jul 1 2019,positive,great movie enjoyed characters writing was wonderful loved fury and the cat
Jul 1 2019,negative,lame and predictable fell asleep halfway through it simple and plain cinematography and boring storyline nice cgi in keeping samuel young again 2 hrs id like to get back
Jul 1 2019,negative,compared to the other marvel movies this by far was the worse the acting the plot weak jokes and pun all bad glad i didnt have to pay to watch this
Jun 30 2019,negative,truly a generic trash marvel film
Jun 30 2019,negative,there were many parts of the movie that made no sense and captain marvel became unkillable in the end
Jun 30 2019,positive,i loved how it showed woman are also strong and empowered i loved how it emphasized that no one should be judged by their outward appearance i loved that it showed that your friends are the family you choose
Jun 30 2019,positive,its good but if you want to see it you should just watch it on dvd or something 
Jun 30 2019,positive,a solid actionspace film worth a watch
Jun 30 2019,positive,captain marvel soars high as the first female led superhero movie in the mcu and honestly its about time we have a female superhero in the sane level as iron thor and captain america to root for while the film suffers from a merely okay script and a dull final showdown the performances here are spectacularespecially that of brie larson and ben mendelsohn its a bird its a plane noits a bad sss woman who can do it all 
Jun 30 2019,positive,not as good as the other marvel movies 
Jun 30 2019,positive,i like this power it stimulate me to be a better person
Jun 30 2019,negative,i think that the story was alright but it couldnt been done waaaaaaay better the dialogue sucked theyre was no character development and the actors were clearly will actors they didnt become their characters as other marvel movies do but most of all there was no reason for me to care about the characters i was greatly disappointed 
Jun 30 2019,negative,oof that was rotten
Jun 30 2019,positive,actually fun and refreshing 
Jun 30 2019,positive,i liked it ill admit that when i went to go see it in theatres i enjoyed it so much i missed its flaws i think it had a lot of potentials and if it was handled better it couldve been great instead of just good apart from that the cast was amazing the action was fun the story was intriguing and ill always enjoy watching it
Jun 30 2019,positive,really enjoyed this the humor is nice the relationships are real and it was a lot of fun
Jun 29 2019,neutral,in a world of high expectations with the mcu this was a disappointment there were fantastic moments but not enough for a great flow of a story 
Jun 29 2019,positive,film is between an a and b heavy on the pc message but the hate for sure overblown by internet trolls on second viewing film and brie larsons portrayal much more likable supporting cast of jude law and sam jackson were amazing 
Jun 29 2019,positive,i enjoyed it very much it tyed into the mcu phase 1 storyline very
Jun 29 2019,positive,an extremely average movie not the worst not the best probability wont be seeing it again 
Jun 29 2019,negative,for a super hero movie i find captain marvel bland and uninspiring most of all disappointing
Jun 29 2019,neutral,was really mediocre glad i did not waste money on it in the theater    i wouldnt recommend paying money to watch it it does not move th mcu arc forward and was just a really basic story without much to it i am surprised it got green lit with that script to be honest feels like it was just slapped together so they would have 2 films to show in 2018
Jun 29 2019,negative,not a good movie no character development brie larson has limited range samuel l jackson was very good as young nick fury and clark gregg is wonderful as phil coulson
Jun 29 2019,positive,not particularly deep or anything groundbreaking but a fun and entertaining ride a movie worth watching
Jun 28 2019,negative,the worst movie ever in marvel
Jun 28 2019,negative,the 30 first minutes of this movie was boring  and so was the rest of the movie i only decided to watch the whole movie because i believed that it might become better oh boy i was wrong dont misunderstand me but i love marvel movies but this one was a huge disappointment from the plot to the characthers  i thought wonder woman  more like wondring woman was a huge disappointment but captain marvel really take the first price
Jun 28 2019,positive,an action packed humorous movie which finally gives fans a strong backstory of a female character it may not be marvels best work but that doesnt stop it from being an amazing movie overall 
Jun 28 2019,negative,a detrimental and unnecessary part of the mcu saga the introduction of some superweapon from nowhere with almost no prior storytelling or even foreshadowing is plainly lazy writing if marvel really wanted to virtue signal so badly they could have just made a movie about one of the existing female leads for which audiences already had a connection ie black widow or scarlett witch   
Jun 28 2019,positive,from most i have talked to i might be the only one who thought this movie was justok  compared to other marvel movies i did not connect to this movie like others
Jun 28 2019,negative,one of the biggest issue with that movie like a lot of other movies that desperatly try to empower women and fail to trully do is that overwelming picture of the man character who necessarely represent the pandora box of humanity and the women whos perfect in everything without having to learn without making mistakes etc     at the end of the day the only feeling that you get from that movie is that the writers are sociopaths who doesnt have any understanding of humans emotions and fail to creat a caracter that alloud the viewer to develop any form of empathy and instead of seeing something that push people to bond they just bring more dicotomy in that world
Jun 28 2019,negative,our protagonist is the most plain and boring character in the mcu marvel movies tend to heavily rely on its cast because if we cant get behind our protagonists then its hard to be invested into the movie as a whole since the main character in the movie is so boring the rest if the movie is you guessed it boring the movie also has way to many plot holes especially after the twist the only reason why this movie doesnt get half a star is because of its tribute to stan lee in the very beginning
Jun 28 2019,negative,not terrible by any means larson was the worst part of the movielike a rock  not a funinteresting character though the supporting cast somewhat makes up for it 
Jun 28 2019,negative,complete  utter garbage  900 lb octopus monster hiding inside a catreal originalop  i want my money  the hour  a half of my life i wasted refunded
Jun 28 2019,negative,long and boring weakest marvel movie
Jun 28 2019,negative,the plot of the movie was good and t he other characters were relatable but captain marvel as a character isnt good 1 shes not funny most marvel fans have gotten accustomed to humor in marvel movies but captain marvels humor comes out as forced and doesnt fit well with the events and setting 2 shes too god damn powerful dc ran into this problem with superman and this will shred all possible suspense the viewer can get as they all know that shes gonna shoot them with lasers and they die 3 it comes off as too progressive i personally would say i am a progressive when it comes to politics but having no important male characters hurts diversity i know fury is an important character but get rid of him from the movie and it doesnt change the story at all and finally 4 the cgi in the movie is pretty bad and this shows with all modern movies but in this movie it is extremely noticeable its as noticeable as the cgi in black panther
Jun 28 2019,positive,good superhero movie would have been better as a stand alone outside of the greater mcu
Jun 27 2019,negative,worst plot worst character ever
Jun 27 2019,negative,very very very bad movie of marvel 
Jun 27 2019,positive,love it great fun i found it much more engaging than many of the other marvel universe films
Jun 27 2019,negative,very bland performance by brie larson and uninteresting 
Jun 27 2019,negative,action scenes so boring where she just kills everything with so little effort
Jun 27 2019,negative,sooo many inconsistencies with the rest of the mcu and the characters are bland
Jun 26 2019,positive,absolutely incredible film i definitely recommend it i dont get the hate and you should form your own opinion from watching it and not decide whether its good or bad from other peoples opinions
Jun 26 2019,negative,yikes a confusing boring slow train wreck 
Jun 26 2019,negative,the character development was weak and the dialogue even weaker  the plot felt like everything was on rails   brie larson came across rather lifeless not sure if it was her the script or both   better luck next time    i watched this and black panther also another over rated movie because i didnt want to have any gaps in the mcu continuity 
Jun 26 2019,positive,it was ok the twist was good 
Jun 26 2019,positive,its good enough that id recommend it but i have to admit wonder woman had a better origin story and thats saying something since most of the mcus movies are better that the dcus
Jun 26 2019,neutral,one of the weaker offerings from the mcu  pacing and setting was off  special effects good story meh  wont make it a must see on free tv
Jun 26 2019,negative,had high hopes too bad better next time maybe  slj was awesome tho
Jun 26 2019,positive,love the story and how unique the storytelling is with a nice twist brie is awesome as captain marvel 
Jun 26 2019,negative,appallingly formulaic 
Jun 26 2019,negative,the movie was boring and the jokes missed the mark every time 
Jun 26 2019,positive,captain marvel is hit or miss in most fronts brie larson at times commands your attention but at other times can fall short in her performance id say the movies main problem is it doesnt take enough risks its here to serve its purpose on setting the character of captain marvel up and it does just that one of the weaker mcu entries up to this point but in no way is this a bad film 
Jun 26 2019,negative,well this movie is so wrong that i wnat to forget that i spent time and money watching it
Jun 26 2019,negative,very dull great visuals no story breaks the mcu continuity and brie larson is the most flat and tasteless character in the mcu everyone tells you about her instead of showing her character she changes facial expression like five times and is a very bland shadow with no explanation of her interesting comic version    not funny the action has no threat and its just boring with no real use of her character no useful impact in the mcu
Jun 26 2019,negative,is this movie good the short answer is no not even samuel jackson could save this one this movie suffers from a massive problembrie larson either cant act or was unsure of how to deliver the character judging from her performance in avengers endgame id say she cant act her performance is bland flat unmemorable and disappointing fortunately this movie can be conveniently omitted from your marvel home library without disrupting the fantastic saga laid out by the other movies lets face it the shelves at my local walmart are fully stocked with this movie for a reason it misses the mark on multiple levels  casting performance story directing and writing when nick fury tells you the last time he trusted someone he lost an eye and your answer for this is a cat scratching it youve just mailed it in they were handed a golden opportunity to really use the eye situation to lay out some interesting twists unfortunately they decided to answer that with the most insulting 10 seconds of marvel cinema yet and its hard to screw up a marvel movie these days keven feige has the formula well in hand you just need to show up do yourself a favor pass on this movie see the rest and pray kevin feige cuts this character loose before brie larson does some real damage to it
Jun 25 2019,positive,the acting was better than i was lead to believe but the storytelling made the movie bland and not very memorable compared to the other recent marvel movies in the end it did entertain
Jun 25 2019,negative,really wanted to like it but the main actress and disney ruined it strayed too far from the comic book and became a political movie instead of being about marvel do that in other movies please dont ruin the marvel franchise
Jun 25 2019,positive,the problem that i had with this movie is what i call the superman problem  a character with basically infinite power reduced down and contained  brie larson seemed like she didnt or wasnt allowed to put much into the character  there was so much wasted potential here  there is a chance to recover in a sequel but i have a feeling that it is going to follow the path of the hulk where it took several movies to get a decent character    
Jun 25 2019,positive,great balance of plot and action cant wait to buy 
Jun 25 2019,neutral,i have never seen more advertisements and overhyping of a movieespecially a marvel movie than for captain marvel they were literally shoving captain marvel and brie larson down our throats i went to see the movie for my birthday and i invited a few friends and i was afraid that the movie would suck because of all the reviews i read online but i ignored them and watched the movie with an open mind personally i think that the movie wasnt as bad as people were saying but it got worse for me after first of all it lacked the humor that marvel movies typically have it was dry the writing was completely different than other movies in the sense that it seemed lazy and usually origin stories that start off character trilogies or introduce new characters arent the best but this one just seemed a bit different also with the release of the movie old videos and interviews circled around about brie larson and people began to dislike her and question the casting choice for captain marvel which in my opinion was why marvel was advertising it so much to cover that also they wanted this movie to stand for feminism which it disintegrated really represent much and no she is not the first female hero in marvel i believe that other marvel women worked hard and might have deserved a movie over captain marvel when i say it got worse for me after im talking about when brie larson said she did her own stunts when she literally has 2 stunt doubles and takes everything to offense to me just the idea that a character will be introduced in a movie and then a month later be in the final movie is just crazy i thought it wasnt going to happen honestly if you think about black panther being introduced in civil war getting his own movie and then again like 2 months later be in the biggest movie of that year i just cant wrap my head around that more recently xmen dark phoenix came out and i have not seen it but the reviews are not good people say it felt empty but especially when it was supposed to serve as a closing chapter for some xmen characters however it was then revealed that dp was supposed to be released in theaters in november 2018 but somehow marvel got in the way of that so captain marvel would come out first so many important points of the dp script were changed because of that which seems unfair i believe dark phoenix would have done much better if marvel wasnt almost forcing us to enjoy captain marvel 
Jun 25 2019,negative,its not terrible but its not good the story was so convoluted and honestly did not engross me as a viewer scenes that were supposed to be emotional left me feeling nothing as a viewer due to the poor script and storytelling i cant tell if the character of captain marvel is supposed to be bland or if that was just the actress but i had no connection with her the supporting cast did a great job the young lady who is her childhood friend was amazing in every scene if you are a marvel fan watch it for the cgi and the backstory on fury but it will feel like a chore
Jun 25 2019,negative,barely any logic a lot off flaws  terrible  misplaced acting dull  nonengaging story  lazy storywriting  unbalanced  overpowered character powersstrengths  few okayish action scenes  humor mwah do i feel positive about female lead characters yes cool and refreshing am i positive about this characterstorymovie hell no 
Jun 25 2019,positive,oh no brie larson wasnt totally feminine and she had no love interest she was still bad ass and funny and the movie was entertaining 
Jun 25 2019,positive,very well done  not awesome but very solid  i should confess that i did not watch any interviews with the star or formulate opinions based on other external factors
Jun 25 2019,negative,fight scenes made no sense at all if these warriors are capable of shooting beams out of their hands why do they need guns for goodness sake brie the newcomer could fly through and destroy a spaceshiplol brie larson is horrible for this role she made as much sense as casting zach galifianakis as james bond
Jun 25 2019,neutral,its ok not as bad as some people say but i think there were to many political messages and that kinda ruined it for me 
Jun 25 2019,negative,it was so boring i wish i could like it formulaic yet the moral storyline was confusing and the political one was contradicting jude law is actually pretty good at his roles but brie larson was kinda bland fury has lost any sort of status not funny nor insightful no character development not the worst though
Jun 25 2019,neutral,very disappointing superhero film going into this i knew it wouldnt be a masterpiece and sure enough i was right the beginning felt way to dragged out for my liking i didnt really care for any of the characters other than nick fury and goose i think captain marvels character was poorly written sadly i was hoping for more than what i got 
Jun 24 2019,positive,im here for brie larsons side eye and sam jacksons banter
Jun 24 2019,positive,she is adorable cute beautiful talented gorgeous   she is just out of the word  love you brie larson 
Jun 24 2019,positive,it was a little bit bland with an okay performance from brie larson samuel l jackson plays a young nick fury and hes the best thing about the film because he seems to be the only one having fun with it the 90s setting was nostalgic with it feeling like a buddy action film from that era however some of the music choices feel cringy and the pop culture references often feel forced first act is the best part of the film as it shows us the kree planet in detail but it falls flat by the second act and just becomes a generic comic book movie with barely any good action scenes to remember 
Jun 24 2019,negative,this movie brought nothing new to the mcu sure it was the first female lead superhero movie but there was no strong storyline there was no epic new fight scene nor was barely any continuity within the mcu and before i get crucified i find nothing wrong with female lead movies look at wonder woman by far the best dceu movie to dateobviously in my opinion    the hype to this movie was contributed by the fact people all around the world insisted you needed to watch this before end game because it was an important segment of the mcu i dont believe it was necessarily a must watch to understand what was happening as she wasnt featured for very long in end game
Jun 24 2019,negative,went into the movie expecting a feminist approach and came out bitterly disappointed brie suited the role and the role was poorly written captain marvel did not win any fights often being thrown to the ground and having to be bailed out when she did she would give them mercy leaving a bad taste her whole role in the film was the wipe mens asses because they couldnt wipe it themselves and felt like the reason why the movie was made was so she could wipe iron mans ass later no character development  the only was that her emotions got the better of her and by the end she was able to suppress them in order to become stronger which is laughably horrific when you think about the treatment of women throughout the centuries coupled with captain marvel standing next to the hulk  besides these feminist woes captain marvel was not enough as a stand alone movie and felt like a filler episode for the avengers
Jun 24 2019,positive,the best movie ive seen in a long time
Jun 24 2019,negative,this movie has  such poor performance by the leading actress mslarsen really doesnt fit the whole hero description and the politically correct nonsense focus on making a great movie and leave the politics out of it
Jun 23 2019,negative,complete failure for a marvel movie cgi was noticeably different and seemed to take a backseat to other films from the studio before it brie larsons delivery doesnt flow as it is more reminiscent of someone who is concentrating on remembering a script her performance with akira akbar is indeed the best part of larsons onscreen time beyond that she doesnt seem dedicated to the character i dont see carol danvers but more of a phone in performance from larson the rest of the cast onscreen undoubtedly seems to know their characters and it shows the forced accreditation is nauseating towards the final 30 minutes of the film furys line during winter soldier in regards to losing his eye is completely anticlimactic even crediting the name of the avengers initiative to danvers was undeserving perhaps the silver lining behind it all will be when black widow final receives its onscreen debut we will all have a female action star who truly can kick ass 
Jun 23 2019,negative,the worst entry into the mcu its not a good sign when the best acting in your film comes from samuel jackson and the crowds favorite is a house cat
Jun 23 2019,negative,neither samuel l jackson jude law or lashana lynch couldnt save it  the lead actor character is not likeable relatable or believable huge budget movie i would imagine but a terrible choice in casting her
Jun 23 2019,negative,what a dull and uninteresting marvel flick this was not worth the money it cost to rent from redbox
Jun 23 2019,positive,although captain marvel reveals a solid range of characters a welldeveloped plot and a good amount of 90s nostalgia the film lacks in emotional depth and character development that would make the film inferior to their mcu counterparts
Jun 23 2019,negative,ok i get it  men are shit and women are amazing  glad i did not have to pay for the notsorare privilege of being fed yet another social justice message  shouldnt we have a lead character that is well developed and sympathetic  shouldnt we have dialogue that conveys thoughful insight  nahlets just go for the indoctrination and demand everyones support  
Jun 23 2019,positive,slow start but once it got going it was fun and compelling
Jun 23 2019,negative,i tried to watch it three times but it just bored the pants off me boring boring boring 
Jun 23 2019,positive,excellent movie great fun and humorous much better than any superman movie
Jun 23 2019,positive,i loved this movie great dialog remarkably touching great editing great acting amazing casting awesome effects strong story and best of all i actually believed 
Jun 23 2019,negative,not impressed very average for marvel the lead was boring character
Jun 23 2019,negative,just rented  the consensus of my family  one of the worse movies we have ever seen
Jun 23 2019,neutral,pretty under average i say but honestly its enjoyable at some points this movie doesnt deserve the hate its getting but the movie isnt amazing 
Jun 23 2019,positive,loved it positive women protagonists without objectifying
Jun 23 2019,positive,just awesome sorry i didnt see it at the movies 
Jun 23 2019,positive,not the best marvel origination movie but certainly better than the audience score indicates it should rate somewhere between the first thor and first captain america movie
Jun 22 2019,negative,ugh what a disappointment the plot made no sense the twist was stupid the deaging on sam looked awesome but he looked slow and clumsy when performing choreography brie was bland and forgettable this movie felt rushed and out of place
Jun 22 2019,negative,captain marvel who does not deviate from marvells pattern is not a bad film but it is not unusual either if i were to rank the 21 marvel movies that have been released so far he probably would have slipped into a reasonable place in the middle not as short as thor the dark world or iron man 2 but it is also not close to the black panther and the guardians of the galaxy marvel fans may feel deja vu while watching captain marvel but will receive a payout however i must admit that i personally suffered while watching
Jun 22 2019,positive,a bit formulaic and definitely not one of marvels best but still a good addition to the mcu 
Jun 22 2019,positive,not as bad as some people are saying but it does lack some of the excitement and feel of wonder that most marvel movies do but it still deserves 35 despite what people took away from some comments from brie
Jun 22 2019,neutral,the thing i dislike most about superhero movies is the ridiculous superpowers and captain marvels superpowers are about as ridiculous as they get but there was enough light entertainment to keep watching to the end
Jun 22 2019,negative,really really bad movie
Jun 22 2019,positive,let me start by saying that i am a marvel fan i should have guess when the critics raved about it that it might be a let down and it was its not horrible but its not on par with the other marvel movies 
Jun 22 2019,positive,empowering and truly inspirational loved the comedy loved the mystery loved the fails loved the music i loved it all
Jun 22 2019,positive,movie rocked  best of all the mcu
Jun 22 2019,negative,i waited to watch this until it was a rental because of the divergent views i didnt think it was going to be in the level of the recent avengers movies but omg it was horrible such poor writing and directing totally implausible not funny some scenes were just unbearable skrulls who are aliens really talk like that and choose to wear a blazer come on spy kids 4 holds more credibility so bad so bad so bad 
Jun 22 2019,neutral,i really wanted to like this movie and there are some really good parts to it unfortunately the worst thing about this movie is the titular hero or at least the actress who played her im not sure if the problem was one of direction or the vision of the character on the part of larson either way the character isnt likable and that continues in endgame carol danvers is arrogant condescending rude and cocky its the combination of traits that doesnt work tony stark is arrogant condescending and cocky but he is very likable thor did that description too black widow has at moments been arrogant and cocky but never unlikable but carol danvers as played by brie larson is just not fun to watch i enjoyed the back story of fury and coulson i enjoyed the twist on the skrulls character or this group of skrulls at least captain marvels fight scene in space against ronan and his ships was cool though very short this isnt a terrible movie but it certainly isnt the best id tank it near the bottom of the mcu movies
Jun 22 2019,positive,a perfect movie that knows very well how to mix humor and emotion the plot twist is surprisingly good brie larson is acting brilliantly one of the best mcus movie ive ever seen in my opinion
Jun 22 2019,negative,this movie made captain marvel strong in the dumbest way and this is the fact that i yawn when i watch this movie
Jun 21 2019,positive,this movie is amazing
Jun 21 2019,neutral,captain marvel is a fine mediocre film its nothing revolutionary and its nothing horrible at the same time captain marvel is supposed to have emotions that need controlling yet she shows no emotion throughout the entire film i wouldnt watch it again also what are her flaws the only flaw that she has is that she cant remember her past 
Jun 21 2019,positive,pretty great good chemistry between castmates girl power fun story
Jun 21 2019,positive,over all i enjoyed the film but i felt she lack some character development hopefully her sequel will focus on that 
Jun 21 2019,negative,you can tell marvel wasnt confident that it was going to do good by the lack of spectacular effects story and acting going into the movie about 5 minutes in i knew the ending of the movie if you seen the 1st guardians of the galaxy you know that the cree are bad and breed larsons dean was dry drier than the steak i had the other night so dry that the government declared a acting drought on her 
Jun 21 2019,positive,solid origin story gave us fun lookbacks at some key characters had good unexpected twists that made the skrulls worth watching properly set up her role in endgame and really flows with the rest of the mcu
Jun 21 2019,negative,mostly a bore fest  the alien cat and references to previous marvel flicks are the best parts of the movie  no real battle with the prime antagonist  i didnt enjoy that 
Jun 21 2019,positive,i was never a fan of captain marvel to begin with but id figured marvel would make her more interesting and likable however that isnt the case instead they made her bland and very emotionless not the worst movie in general but by marvel standards its not that great
Jun 21 2019,neutral,mediocre movie have potential but lead actress lacks the charisma to see it thru
Jun 21 2019,positive,yes it has its flaws i saw the villain reveal pretty early on in the movie as well  they couldve spent more time fleshing out carols character a bit more as she did feel a bit like she flipflopped between two characters but overall i enjoyed this quite a bit  im not sure what the hate was about but i was definitely not expecting to like the skrulls to the point where i had high hopes for them  in the end i still liked the character of captain marvel im curious  to see what they have in store for her aside from her lackluster appearance in endgame
Jun 21 2019,negative,worst marvel movie ever acting was a joke plot was simple and such unrealistic actscenes 
Jun 20 2019,positive,solid 4stars stan lee got sued for this and it is still a week story line captain marvel is iron mana replacement horrible choice marvel comics 
Jun 20 2019,positive,it was pretty good id rank it on the lower end of the marvel movies but it was decently entertaining  best part of the movie was the fantastic soundtrack brie was good in it but i think she was a little one dimensional as a character the twists and skrulls were also weak but not nearly as bad as ironman 3 or thor dark world
Jun 20 2019,negative,marvels most boring movie yet
Jun 20 2019,negative,contrived plot points ridiculous aussie accents and slang when the aliens were themselves and an obvious feminist agenda with the hero having no flaws but awesome abilities
Jun 20 2019,positive,ignore all the trolls it is probably one of my favorite marvel movies love brie larson as captain marvel
Jun 20 2019,negative,movies need to start giving refunds  this was garbage
Jun 20 2019,negative,made for tv aesthetic it deserved much more production value but i guess the studio didnt have much faith in it since it looks like a cw show and they felt the need to tie it to endgame
Jun 20 2019,negative,she had no trouble slicing humongous space ships in half but had to spend so many minutes beating up 45 nobodies inside that laboratory spaceship rubbish
Jun 20 2019,negative,i was promised phil coulson in hammerpants i was left quite disappointed
Jun 20 2019,positive,the movie was decent good special effects with an underwhelming story the acting isnt bad but it also isnt great it tries a little too hard to be political okay who am i kidding it got rather political in some places some political jokes are fine in a movie but captain marvel often gets political in things actually happening in the movie which can be annoying the movie tries to make a plot around the strong female character instead of making a strong female character around the  plot 610 below average for marvel especially considering that it comes between the cinematic masterpieces that were infinity war and endgame but a decent movie nonetheless
Jun 19 2019,positive,as a fan of marvel and all the mcu movies this movie was slightly disappointing it was fun to watch and i enjoyed finally seeing captain marvel on the big screen flaunting her impressive abilities but much of the movie felt played out the story line was unoriginal and many of the lines were corny 
Jun 19 2019,positive,this may be my favorite of the 22 mcu movies
Jun 19 2019,positive,i didnt think brie larson could pull this off but she did a great job love her more now
Jun 19 2019,negative,boring film with the wrong message
Jun 19 2019,positive,its good the beginning a bit off alien guy maybe a bit too goofy but its fine cat is great
Jun 19 2019,positive,it was not what i thought it would be going into a marvel movie the entire thing was rushed to get captain marvel into the mcu nick fury was the most entertaining part about this movie
Jun 19 2019,positive,it has all the elements of an origin story but with enough twist to keep it interesting and answered a other character questions enquiring minds wanted to know and got to see the man himself one last time
Jun 19 2019,positive,i dont get why people rated this movie so poorly it was thoroughly entertaining and the back and forth dialogue with samuel l jackson was awesome 
Jun 19 2019,neutral,theres a great moment around the 85 to 90 minute mark that is emotional and there is a good end credit scene 
Jun 19 2019,negative,the acting was really really bad plot was a little better 
Jun 18 2019,negative,the mcus weakest movie to date  badly written acted and directed 
Jun 18 2019,negative,believe the audience rating this is a poorly made film great effects but a waste of brie larson the film is a big waste of time and very awkwardly paced screenplay is bad too
Jun 18 2019,neutral,if we compare captain marvel with others superheroes movies we can conclude that captain marvel is the worst character story all marvel superheroes movies show the early life of superhero at the beginning and then how heshe obtains the superpower as a forward story but captain marvel started backwardly at the beginning she already has a superpower but she doesnt remember anything about how she got it until the end when she finds out how she obtained it i think the writers made a different a style of superhero movie to surprise the audience with some twist in the story but they failed because it was a bad twist and no one surprised or impressed they could make a wonderful emotional and enjoyable movie if they just make it forward and clear showing her early life not as a flashback until she becomes a captain marvel    i read a lot of negative reviews and i think most audiences hated captain marvel due to many factors  1 less action than other marvel movies  2 released after the masterpiece avengers infinite war so all marvel audience were expecting same or more from captain marvel  3 her power wasnt special its almost like superman  4 lack of humor  5 not following straight forward story as same as other superhero movies    finally captain marvel is just a tv movie not good and not bad if you are one of marvel audience you will not like it but if you just want to watch a superhero movie maybe you will enjoy a little
Jun 18 2019,neutral,very mediocre mcu film wasnt complete trash but far from being one of the good ones captain marvel didnt really have much growth as a character in my opinion and the film also lacked a competent villain nick fury was one of the better parts of the film your not missing much if you chose not to watch
Jun 18 2019,negative,i was actually hoping for more i loved most of the comic incarnations of her 
Jun 18 2019,negative,oh dear how many more of these marvel films do i have to sit through the message was clear enough 6 months before the films release female empowerment this has clearly failed in the exact same way as wonder woman just because the main character is a woman does not make it great marvel and dc need to take note from james cameron who wrote strong female characters with sarah connor and ellen ripley to rub salt in the would this is yet again a terribly structured movie with no conclusion and a film so full of plot holes i am sure they will keep making 3 of these every year until the year 3000 
Jun 18 2019,negative,some good action scenes but dry acting and too political 
Jun 18 2019,positive,this was done right i hope that hollywood takes note that this is the way to make a movie with a strong female lead this is also an example of how to do an origin movie very little time is spent leading up to the action with some well timed flash backs to fill in the blanks
Jun 18 2019,positive,though its fun and the visuals are awesome captain marvel is a major disappointment in the mcu because of larsons awful performance and because of how overrated its become just go see wonder woman instead it made a much better impact on female empowerment
Jun 18 2019,negative,really  yoy be more better
Jun 18 2019,negative,literally the only part of this movie i liked was goose the cat cats are always great but captain marvel as a character is trying too hard
Jun 18 2019,negative,very poor story full of plot holes
Jun 18 2019,negative,an agenda pushing movie not a superhero kinda movie like marvels other movies
Jun 18 2019,positive,lackluster in every single way 
Jun 18 2019,negative,the only good moment in this socallen movie is the cat everything else is a halfbaked trash without and sense style and logic in it the worst marvel movie ever made even worse than the first hulk leading role is a firstgrade miscast
Jun 18 2019,negative,not that i dont like girl kicking ass movie just this one kinda let down    captain marvel characters are too moderate and dont have the charisma that captain marvel should both the voice and act i only enjoy the time carol happy go lucky flashback and the time when nick fury doing his gag     carol and fury duo time also not fully to the best theyre still a space between them that can fill and the need to the problem obviously character development on carols i wish they show the marvel origin power like the comic but they rather put lots of unnecessary things    this movie as is titled should be more than this im hoping mcu can fix this title for the next phase i dont want to compare with other mcu movies but we can see this movie cant go on par with the one that already established     thanks for the hard work mcu still waiting for the upcoming movies all the best         
Jun 18 2019,negative,poor plot and bad story telling in which items said and developed in the beginning and mid movie contradict with ending and resolution towards the end poor lead character hard to believe in and support 
Jun 18 2019,negative,this might be one of the absolute worst moves i have ever seen  this includes a catalog of nearly 5k plus movies over the years  even if you take the movie for what it is and rated it on the scale of lets say triple x or the expendable this movie still falls short on acting  plot  dialogue and action  this movie makes green lantern look like an oscar worthy flick written by the cohen brothers with the nolan brothers both writing and directing  
Jun 18 2019,positive,its a middling marvel effort but its good fun it comes with all the action and quips youd come to expect from this franchise theres a light sprinkling of pc propaganda but not enough to distract or ruin the movie sam jackson is better here than hes been in years hes clearly having a blast and we end up having fun along with him love the music choices throughout the movie even if theyre a bit contrived
Jun 17 2019,positive,funny and energetic the characters are all extremely likable ben mendelson steals the show its not a girl power film danvers never fawns over a man or has to wear revealing attire to sell herself as an equal she simply is as the father of a daughter this film is empowering to women without politicizing the issue that isnt the focus of the film rather it is an enjoyable origin story to both marvel and nick fury very similar in feel to ragnarok great soundtrack and leaves you feeling motivated
Jun 17 2019,positive,what a fun time i am surprised by the low audience score but my family and i really enjoyed captain marvel samuel jackson really adds to this movie getting a lot of laughs and adding a certain spice that makes this move funny and satisfying  brie does a solid job as captain marvel i enjoyed that they set the piece back in the 80s90s it adds a bit of a nostalgia vibe similar to what stranger things did both my husband and dad enjoyed wonder woman more but still walked away from the theater happy they saw captain marvel  
Jun 17 2019,positive,it awesome and a must see for marvel fans
Jun 17 2019,negative,i usually like marvel movies but this might be the turning point my only issue is brie larson and the plot twist i hope better for the future
Jun 17 2019,positive,a cogent parallel emerges between a seenitall hero with a lost identity fighting supposed enemies who can change their identity while still seeking a solution for their own marvels usual plethora of plot holes emerges to justify the stakesshredding overpowered convenience of the hero at the expense of whatever constitutes canon in this franchise eraappropriate sexism is thrown in for good measure nondiegetic dad rock infects the soundtrack because nostalgia ding goes the microwave and out serves this steaming confection of abovemediocrity  as per marvels mission statement although i have to give it to marvel to present a hero whose arc doesnt revolve about either ones fluctuating level of douchebaggery or ones need for acceptance    and despite being a catlover who hates the use of this particular word goose is completely overrated hes basically an arbitrarily godlike mix between lolcat memes and a cthulhugroot mouth that is when hes not just sitting there being oh so cute yes he is yes he is
Jun 17 2019,positive,wasnt a bad movie but i wouldnt watch it more than the 1 time  this movie wasnt very interesting and i am wishing that i just waited for this to be available on some sort of streaming app   very much like solocaptain marvel addresses  questions that no one was asking no one really cares about cpt marvel  the only thing that is interesting about cpt marvel is that rogue xmen takes her powers    i would suggest watching this if one is very bored but if youre wanting to watch some sort of female empowering movie watch wonder woman instead
Jun 17 2019,positive,from all the bad reviews i thought it was going to be bad but instead it was a very wellwritten script and everything was just right including the performance of carol danvers the lead as fantastic as the plot lines of all superhero movies actually are people seem to forget a role like this should be played with temperance and brie larson delivers just the right amount the supporting cast was good perhaps people didnt like this movie due to the political themes it represents but that isnt really about the movie anymore is it its their own prejudices and biases a superb wellwritten and wellacted film
Jun 17 2019,positive,i expected nothing from this film with all the bad press leading up to its release and then the backlash after release we decided to give it a miss at the cinema once again i allowed myself to be swayed by an online agenda to destroy a movie never again  i enjoyed this movie i had no problem with any of the casting especially the lead role the story was okay the cgi was also okay we found captain marvel to be better on second viewing picked up on more details and just plain enjoyed the whole movie   highlight of the film is definitely nick fury   
Jun 17 2019,neutral,the film is good for fans of the mcu and firsttime viewers brie larson is an average carol danvers and captain marvel samuel ljackson goose the cat and ben mendelsohn are all very good as the supporting cast there are some other characters that are not as well developed it is annoyingly filled with the most mindnumbing 90s references that are used mainly for jokes instead of building a truly detailed setting the film has also strange and underdeveloped villains with an anticlimatic third act it is one of the mcus weakest offerings but would be recommended for anybody looking for a slightly entertaining blockbuster 
Jun 17 2019,positive,it was action packed loved how it did answer some questions like how fury got his eye patch a fun girl power movie
Jun 17 2019,negative,superheroes movie with feminist political agenda and bad acting yikes
Jun 17 2019,negative,the first hour is a waste of time
Jun 17 2019,negative,captain marvel is a two hour gillette razor commercial on toxic masculinity the movie is not integral to the marvel cinematic universe so feel free to skip it before going to endgame 
Jun 17 2019,negative,if i could give this 0 stars i would captain marvel  is on par with the green lantern movie marvel should bury this atrocity glad i waited so long to watch this because it was an expected waste of time burn it
Jun 17 2019,negative,boring over powered character with zero character arc 
Jun 17 2019,positive,a fairly fresh take on superhero movies which shows the audience that whowhat is good is not always what meets the eye
Jun 16 2019,positive,missing an actual character arc
Jun 16 2019,positive,at first i wasnt sure of this movie but after watching it for a second time i realized i was viewing this movie in the wrong light ive been wowed by the mcu i went in with very high expectations then i realized this is an origin movie there isnt much amazing things that go on during an origin story action isnt the star the story is once i viewed it how it is and not what i was expecting i was very pleased i was very surprised by jude law ive never seen any of his movies maybe one spy which is a comedy but jude law is a pretty boy hes there to just look good so once i saw how he did with his character i was surprised he did a good job only let down was how rather disappointed on how nick fury lost his eyethe last time he trusted someone he lost his eyeand it was a flurken
Jun 16 2019,positive,an actionpacked and visually stunning mcu flick combined with boden and flecks direction the script boden and fleck cowrote with dworet perlman and lefauve the performances of the cast topraks score daviss cinematography berman and grahams editing nicholsons production design gaffins set decoration hays costume design action sequences and visual effects captain marvel is a blast to the past trip for the mcu and a great one at that
Jun 16 2019,positive,loved it bree did a spectacular job helping us get to know carols story 
Jun 16 2019,neutral,i saw this movie with my mother because i was excited about endgame and wanted to spend some bonding time with my mom i remember actually feeling bored in the theater the agents of shield connection was cool but overall i was disappointed by this movie i remember some jokes and 90s nostalgia and thats honestly just about it i didnt feel like i gained anything by watching this film and i wasnt even entertained brie larsons performance was mediocre but the story and directing was bad
Jun 16 2019,positive,really welldone nice ploy i really enjoyed it
Jun 16 2019,positive,certainly entertaining storyline comes together at the end and when this movie comes to tv you will stop and watch it again
Jun 16 2019,negative,lackluster plot line bolstered by a lead hero with shallow if any character development 
Jun 16 2019,positive,meh not the worst marvel movie but i found it very forgettable 
Jun 16 2019,positive,i wanted to give this five stars to offset all the bad reviews it was both funny enjoyable and appropriately done i think it is a step forward to have a fully competent female lead where her value is bolstered by being a love interest i loved how the slip in the origins of the avengers and background for both fury and coulson a very good origin story that held my whole familys interest one thing that bothered me was her smugness especially at first but i see how it was used to develop her character well done marvel and co 
Jun 16 2019,negative,this move tried so despretly to appeal to todays feminist that it lost all hope of a good story line
Jun 16 2019,positive,a great example of applying a formula with slight changes in order to get something right this is also one of those movies where you cant trust one of the tomato meters  in this cast the audience score the critics meter is more accurate at 78 its definitely better than the first thor movie maybe a bit under the first captain america on par with antman could use some more humor but overall it hits the mark
Jun 16 2019,neutral,not marvels best work its an okay origins story saved by the cast the cgi is not the best production on the film seemed off but it was still a decent film 
Jun 16 2019,positive,first off i had a first time seeing it honestly i love brie larson as captain marvel are nonstop jokes and puns are ridiculous but funny i also love how the movie takes us back to the mastalgia days back to the 90s basically when there was blockbuster and radioshack and im not going to lie captain marvel carol danvers her outfit was killer and she was a great female heroine of the marvel series brie larson did her graphics well and the movie was just altogether amazing and made you understand that our character started off with no memory as long as she was but when she crash lands on earth are planets she starts to remember things and her memories eventually do come back to her and she realizes who the real villain is and at the moment fights for the alien race so i say i give it a fivestar thumbs up im not really a marvel fan technically i like dc and marvel both so im not a fan of either i will give a hand tomorrow though their first female lead superhero movie was great
Jun 16 2019,neutral,captain marvel is flashy humorful and has good cgi but there is nothing that makes this movie emotional exciting or entertaining  this is the marvel formula at its worst
Jun 16 2019,positive,great movie the marvel machine has cranked out yet another classic and that was one cool cat
Jun 16 2019,negative,this was a terrible movie marvel was championed as a great hero for girls to rally around but because we never see a motivation for her as a character shes unrelatable all we see is captain marvel standing up when she could have stayed down thats not motivation thats lazy writing furthermore shes completely emotionless admittedly thats something she has to overcome throughout the film as a character but in her time on earth particularly as her memory returned so to should her humanity and ability to feel by the end of the film the only difference is her power shes the same character we see in the beginning and no thats not a good thing furthermore and this is one of the things that bugged me personally was that she was completely unstoppablle in her powered state superman is championed as being super op and unbeatable but thats not true case in point man of steel when he fought zod captain marvel had never flown before she figured that out instantly she had no clue she could survive in space she figured that out instantly she had no idea she was virtually indesctrucible she figured that out instantly frankly the 3rd act was a colossal let down to an otherwise bland movie     oh and the feminism angle was terrible because it made all the male characters look useless fury was utterly powerless all throughout the film while in comparison to the comics fury was a war hero the kind youd send into the field to end the battle sure he was against superior strength but that doesnt mean he wouldnt use both wit and skill to do more than escort the hostages at the end   
Jun 16 2019,positive,i thought this was a very good origin movie not sure why it got a bad rating
Jun 15 2019,positive,great movie wait part 2
Jun 15 2019,positive,average lot of flashbacks and story building but very light on action until the end the acting was pretty good i guess comparing it to other marvel films this one fall short cant win em all
Jun 15 2019,positive,this is great tight writing dont mind the cnotroversy surrounding brie larsons comments
Jun 15 2019,positive,there is one scene in captain marvel that outshines all the others in this scene we see carol danvers throughout her life but more importantly we see carol danvers falling down again and again and we see her getting up every time this is a lesson of being human it is a lesson of being a young girl and woman who is told over and over again that they cannot do something but doing it anyway the movie tells this story through funny and heartwarming moments 
Jun 15 2019,positive,i was late to the party on watching captain marvel because of a lot of the things people were complaining about  however i thought it was an average type movie  i was just a little lost for most of the movie
Jun 15 2019,negative, worse tomorrow movie out  brie larson is a horrible actress she had a horrible personality and no range when it comes to acting  instead of getting backstory and understanding to the characters in the movie they spent the entire movie trying to push the im a woman so ive been told i couldnt do it all my life so im better than all of you  i couldnt do it on my life so im better than all of you attitude  wonder woman had a strong powerful female lead without pushing  any agendas 
Jun 15 2019,neutral,better than hulk and the first two thor movies dial down the overt feminism disney you hurting yourself i thought wonder woman was great
Jun 15 2019,positive,i finally got a chance to see this movie and i enjoyed it  the cast was great and  i liked nick furys interactions with goose the cat  the film seemed to move pretty quickly but the directors covered a lot of ground in a short amount of time to catch the audience up to speed with captain marvels background  
Jun 15 2019,positive,nice start than in turned all around when she got her powers naturally
Jun 15 2019,positive,nothing special not bad either dont really know what to say about either the story or the actors enjoyed seeing gemma chan though 
Jun 15 2019,negative,felt rushed and that too much happens too fast in terms of character development  we hear she is great but they dont bother to show any relevant past moments its as if the writers watched the mcu once and banged thing out  a lot of continuity issues all over the place in this notsogreat installment  this was about a halfhour too long  better than the hulk but hovering right around there in terms of mcu rank
Jun 15 2019,positive,i enjoyed the movie as a movie and would watch again if i was bored but brie larson is painful to watch as a main character
Jun 15 2019,positive,just another amazing marvel movie in there collection that is all
Jun 14 2019,negative,hahaha who wrote this movie its choppy boring inconsistent but with a predictable plot just plain terrible 
Jun 14 2019,positive,best or 2nd best origin story ive seen from marvel brie larson and samuel jackson were excellent ben mendelsohn talos and lashana lynch maria rambeau were great in supporting roles definitely in my top 3 from marvel captain america first avenger captain marvel winter soldier and i rate it slightly above wonder woman as female led role in super hero film also a great soundtrack of late 80s early 90s music fit well especially no doubt just a girl for the fight sequence against the kree i think brie larson was an excellent fit for the movie well done
Jun 14 2019,negative,brie larson is problematic off screen but this movie is just flat and boring  there is no emotion in danvers  we have no reason to invest in her or care about her  she lacks the characteristics that make us love our other marvel characters and more than that she lacks team spirit or a sense of unity  this is by far the worst marvel experience ive ever had
Jun 14 2019,negative,meh another ruined franchise
Jun 14 2019,neutral,its actually a pretty good story let down by the lead actor this should have been a role to have fun with but brie larson as verscarol danvers seems to be trying much too hard consequently she comes across as too light in the serious moments and very flat in the light ones there are a few girl power dialogue moments that come across as contrived unnatural word usage but it doesnt come across as man hating as some would have us believe the supporting cast generally performs well the highlight being samuel l jackson but i found jude law vaguely annoying not terrible but a weak addition to the marvel universe
Jun 14 2019,neutral,i love brie larson acting here but the cgi is not good its too animated i mean look at another marvel movies and youll notice how the cgi of this movie is not perfect its like they made this movie in a hurry 
Jun 14 2019,negative,they totally shouldve cast a different actress for this movie
Jun 14 2019,negative,there was no conflict in this movie at all she was never even challenged and she acted like she knew it even her big superhero moment was ruined by her being invincible the entire movie
Jun 14 2019,negative,at its core a pretty well written well acted superhero movie with some great twist and stunning action what seemed to constantly drag it down though was the character development of captain marvel herself who didnt seem to prove that she was ever anything greater than what her powers allowed her to be something  critical to the characterization of any superhero brie larsons captain marvel consequently failed to deliver in ways that other great female superheroes like black widow and wonder woman have
Jun 13 2019,neutral,very uninspired origin story i like brie larson as an actress dont care what her political views are  i didnt feel like she had to earn her powers or went through any sort of character arc that was deserving of the powers she has this also carries forward in avengers endgame she just appears out of nowhere towards the end of that movie and destroys pretty much everything
Jun 13 2019,negative,fun moments yet her skills are very op very feminist film she super skilled without doing much that could beat thor
Jun 13 2019,positive,brie larson was made for the role of captain marvel and she was able to bring the character to life in its complex plot captain marvel mixes new and old elements of the mcu to make an eclectic film there is something for everyone
Jun 13 2019,positive,with enough action and humour it gets by as another enjoyable enough mcu origin story samuel l jackson and goose are great but brie larson as captain marvel herself is not amazing it is about as good as iron man 3 if you can get past the mandarin 
Jun 13 2019,negative,boring fury was the only redeeming aspect of the movie oh and the cat
Jun 13 2019,negative,this one was just blah 
Jun 13 2019,positive,i thought it was very good and brie larson is gorgeous
Jun 13 2019,negative,terrible the absolute worst super hero movie of all time i actually fell asleep during this one it tried so hard to point out the lessons learned that it failed control your emotions  no problem it was completely forgettable
Jun 13 2019,positive,great backstory on the avengers superlative effects and a rockin score
Jun 13 2019,negative,what can i say the movie was meh brie larsons performance fell flat it just seemed forced i just couldnt buy into her as the hero it was ok worth seeing in a discount theater for a buck fifty
Jun 13 2019,positive,awesome movie all around
Jun 12 2019,positive,i dont get why this film doesnt get more praise  its smart funny and brie larson totally stole the show  think of ironman but sexier the 90s soumdtrack which is smartly inserted in the film also shd be acknowledged
Jun 12 2019,positive,the performance of brie larson in captain marvel is emotional strong and fun another great success of marvel studios thanos get ready 
Jun 12 2019,positive,pretty good movie loved the blast from the past stuff liked the characters entertaining fun watchable
Jun 12 2019,negative,compared to the other movies in the mcu it was boring and predictable 
Jun 12 2019,positive,good first movie getting the base in ready for the next instalment 
Jun 12 2019,positive,its good because of the nick fury storyline but i didnt like that captain marvel was overpowered and had a weak storyline
Jun 12 2019,negative,boring agendadriven drivel sad to see that this is the future of the mcu
Jun 12 2019,neutral,better than iron man 2 or thor the dark world  inferior to most of the mcu  the protagonist isnt that likeable is far too close to being a mary sue  the other characters are interesting though
Jun 12 2019,negative,just expensive version of babylon 5 tv series
Jun 12 2019,negative,bland slow lazy and poor writing action scenes boring confused how brie larson ever won an oscar with this uninspiring performance i hope they dont make a captain marvel 2  
Jun 12 2019,positive,just another action packed movie full of mindless villains that at end of it pose no real threat to the protagonist just existing to be defeated and in this case so that brie larson gets to express her semingly infinite powers due to her god like charecteristics in comparison to other characters the movie makes them borring and dull im talking about characters that are amazing like nick fury portrayed on this film as larsons litlle cat lover sideckic but if you take its comic book mundaness you get great special effects great actors that do their best on their roles which would be fairly amazing if given good character storys  exception is with captain marvel but overshadows the others 
Jun 12 2019,positive,dont listen to the internet haters captain marvel is another great outing from the marvel cinematic universe even if it hits some turbulence trying to take to the skies
Jun 12 2019,negative,larsens acting is a bit flat  storytelling was dull  at a climactic point captain marvel stands up and we see all these images of her past self standing up but the effect falls short since we knew practically nothing about her childhood  the girl power cliches were tiresome  the catflurken thing was annoying  fury losing his eye to it was downright dumb  one last thing skrulls being the good guys is wasting some really good bad guys  it was a dumb idea to make them besties with captain marvel and nick fury
Jun 12 2019,negative,captain marvel is a movie that is showing that not every comic book character should get their own movie the movie is shallow and repeatedly beats you over the head with 90s nostalgia sam jackson is the only good part of this movie as the special effect deaging was very well done the fact this was a prequel hurt the movie as characters who show up in other movies like ronan and korath couldnt be killed and as a result theres very little investment in the vast cast of one note characters the worst part was the main character who we dont get emotionally invested in before she goes all super and brie larsons acting performance ricochets between halfasleep and trying to be starlords grunge sister all in all this movie fails on multiple levels
Jun 12 2019,positive,a fun story that was light and enjoyable with not great but adequate acting enough action to keep me interested and a notsoserious plot line that went back to the 90s and showed some of our favorite mcu characters as rookies as well as a great soundtrack from that era  i couldnt help but notice the amount of foolishly toxic male characters its sad the writers couldnt dream up any other motivation to drive the hero overall decent action flick 
Jun 12 2019,neutral,like superman its hard to make a story about a hero with too much power interesting there isnt any risk or stress in this movie for me that makes it sort of bland
Jun 12 2019,negative,captain marvel is a deeply mundane and hallow movie while it retains the great visual effects that is to be expected from a marvel movie the plot is needlessly convoluted and has more holes than a cheese grater the characters are either cardboard cutouts of what theyre supposed to represent or deflated versions of already known characters the overall themes though served with good intentions are presented in a bland unempowering way wonder woman is a super heroine movie that actually empowers and humanizes women in a way that is serviceable to the real world brie larson gives us a bland performance which is unusual given her track record this movie is a stain on the later stage of the mcu much like the films of the first stage go watch wonder woman or wait until blackwidow comes out
Jun 11 2019,positive,not completely boring seeing another side of nick fury was fun
Jun 11 2019,positive,it was ok nothing special 
Jun 11 2019,negative,complete trash dont waste your time
Jun 11 2019,negative,not great not okay please  do better
Jun 11 2019,positive,much better than wonder woman thats for sure this actress can actually act lol 
Jun 11 2019,negative,carol is an overpowered superhero who didnt have to work hard for her powers or make any sort of great sacrifice she basically gets to do whatever she wants and really follows no moral code but the movie at least has some good visuals
Jun 11 2019,positive,we loved this movie its definitely one of our favorite marvel movies
Jun 11 2019,negative,was kinda bland and felt uninspired 
Jun 11 2019,positive,honestly the hatred from nerds basically brie larson said during an interview that she didnt care what middle aged white guys thought of her movie not captain marvel she was referring to the critics which seem to be completely detached from reality right now and constantly at odds with the audience this triggered a ton of nerds who feel that anything featuring a strong female lead is too woke and instantly took it personally even though she wasnt talking about them and now this movie keeps getting hatred from audience votes an honest unbiased review a good origin movie on par with all the other marvel introductory films similar standard to iron man 1 captain america 1 and thor 1 no better or worse than any of those and hopefully a good introduction to the next phase where there will be earthbound stories and others set in space to account for the different scales of power  
Jun 11 2019,positive,funny enough waiting for the next sequel
Jun 11 2019,negative,seems very out of place  if she can do all those things why have any other super hero  bad writing and brie larson didnt help  
Jun 10 2019,negative,worst movie in the series worst movie i have invested my time into for a few years  
Jun 10 2019,positive,captain marvel is packed with elements that should have made it a very enjoyable superhero movie yet is let down my one very important misstap the casting of the actress playing the main character i have honestly never seen another movie with brie larsson in it that i can remember so she may be a great actress but you wouldnt be able to tell from this film she simply lacks the charisma to carry the film which is especially noticable next to jackson and mendelsohn she does okay in the lighter parts of the film but fails to bring any sense of gravitas where needed as a result she seems very detachted from the events unfolding around her and all of her scenes fall flat of what thee could have been 
Jun 10 2019,negative,i waited a while after all the bashing has sort of elapsed as a marvel comic book fan and supporter of the mcu this story crapped all over comic book continuity they rewrote the origin of marvell whyand monica rambeau i get it its not comics but this was devastating the first mcu film i did not watch in theaters
Jun 10 2019,negative,incredibly subpar story is predictable boring and at times confusing cant seem to make up its mind as to what it wants to be and changes the outline several times throughout barely even see captain marvel herself
Jun 10 2019,positive,i overall love the movie for what it was
Jun 10 2019,negative,does not help the continuity of the mcu the acronym of shield already being introduced when they did not have that in the first iron man the talented actress continues to fall short of how to act in and out of marvel movies with most fans split on her with many truly despising the character and actress
Jun 10 2019,positive,i absolutely loved this movie the story was well put out and was interesting absolute mush watch
Jun 10 2019,negative,a taint on the ten years of work that has gone into the making marvel universe movies so great  the best friend was more likeable then the main character who came off as cocky and so full of herself that being a hero was too far of a stretch to be believable even in the movie world  
Jun 10 2019,negative,not up to the standards of all the other marvel movies was actually worse than some recent dc movies i never read captain marvel comics so i dont know the background this movie felt like you had to know some background of her story going into watching it i was a bit confused at times about certain aspects of the story how did she become so powerful basically like superman why arent there any others like her and all of a sudden she learned how to fly too at the end and what is up with the alien cat the script was just so random i did not enjoy this movie nearly as much as avengers ironman or deadpool 
Jun 10 2019,positive,drags a little bit but overall good movie 
Jun 10 2019,positive,i was surprised by how much i loved this movie from start to finish my eyes were glued to the screen 
Jun 10 2019,negative,brie larsons boring portrayal of captain america destroyed all of my expectations i can list dozens of other actresses with more emotion and acting ability who could have carried this movie much further the director didnt seem to have watched any of the mcu movies considering the inconsistencies the way carol received her powers didnt make any sense at all changing marvells gender was unnecessary and felt very forced making marvel the most powerful avenger doesnt make any sense and the speed of light technology giving her that ability makes even less sense and they misused the skrull worst movie of the mcu franchise so far and worst marvel movie since daredevil 
Jun 10 2019,negative,marvel dropped the ball 
Jun 10 2019,positive,great movie to see how she became captain marvel awesome powers
Jun 10 2019,neutral,it would be a stretch to call this movie good but it wasnt as bad as i was expecting it to be the skrulls were disappointing they looked like something out of a high school play rather than a big budget movie the storyline was decent enough i suppose and didnt bore however the depiction of marvell was ridiculous and a much more dynamic actor should have been cast as carol danvers they tried to accomplish girl power  with shameless pandering rather than substance probably should have watched wonder woman to see how that is done overall its a very skippable movie in the marvel universe 
Jun 9 2019,positive,i follow the mcu because of avengers so of course when captain marvel comes around i have to see even though im not really looking forward to it  i dont particularly like brie larson and the things ive seen in the trailers dont give me much confidence  so it took a long while for me to go see it and yes i streamed it i actually had to start over three times because i was instantly bored and uninterested in what was happening  so today i finally made it to the end and im totally blown away that this got a fresh rating on rottentomatoes and a 7 a freaking 7 on imdb  the 319 rating feels a lot more accurate    im not even sure what to say about it  the acting is okay i guess nothing really stands out  the fight between yonrogg and carol seems way to small  carol is continuously accused of being to emotional while it looks more like a problem with authority  and then carol doesnt seem likeable not even a little bit  and the way she just takes out the space ships it makes me a little worries about avengers endgame because she looks to powerful and not a team player we will have to see how they are going to solve that the trailer didnt give me much confidence though    the humour well sigh  the cat is cute lets leave it at that    if you ask me the movies has a lot of luck being part of the mcu with its loyal fan base  was it bad  no  will i see it again also no
Jun 9 2019,positive,perfect one of marvels best movies and marvels best origin story brie larson does a perfect job as the movies main character and im so excited to see more of her
Jun 9 2019,negative,just mehhh the character is awful  like the comics
Jun 9 2019,positive,it was a great movie i loved it in my 40s and my niece loved it in her teens great time by all
Jun 9 2019,positive,better than i was expecting loved the characters action scenes and overall charm of the film thanos better look out 
Jun 9 2019,negative,the movie was an abomination the worst of mcu history the movie looked like kevin feige was on drugs while making it i felt like i was going to fall asleep when brie larrson was talking the vissual effect lokked like  an drunk amatour made it  and captain marval acted like a jackass 
Jun 9 2019,negative,it is really that bad
Jun 9 2019,negative,this is not captain marvel i used to know very bad scenario which has alot of strang expressions the story of the movies is not quit strong for a superhero like her and yes women are strong  have thier own way to live thier life in real world but in the movie they want to be like men so much it is like she say i want to be a man
Jun 9 2019,positive,awesome to have a female lead in the marvel movies
Jun 9 2019,neutral,i dont really know why but i had such high expectations of this movie even though im not a huge avengers fan anyway it was also too long for my taste i didnt like the cast as well
Jun 9 2019,negative,this movie made it to the bottom of my marvel movie list i can honestly say the worst movie ive seen all year but to each his own
Jun 9 2019,positive,i dont understand why people are hating this movie i liked it ill admit that i put off seeing it because of the negative buzz but i regret not seeing it sooner people myself included need to think for themselves and form their own opinions on movies i usually end up liking movies that have bad critic reviews or that the og comic nerds think are bad 
Jun 9 2019,negative,had to rate this film just because this movie  character werent that important to the mcu franchise they built her up for what 10 mins of end game time also her acting is terrible
Jun 9 2019,positive,epic watched it 3 times in theater
Jun 9 2019,positive,honestly didnt go into the movie with high hopes but it exceeded all expectations and was really amazing this is a great movie for girls empowerment and showing how strong a woman can be i love this movie so much
Jun 9 2019,negative,this movie seemed over over hype that had potential 
Jun 9 2019,negative,very bland absoulty nothing special about jt and ruined nick furys character
Jun 9 2019,negative,badjust really really bad
Jun 8 2019,positive,digitally enhanced samuel l jackson looking like the jules winnfield in pulp fiction without the big hair brings me back to the 90s of course there are the 90s rock and vhs brie larson is lit  literally i did not expect this to be good but i find it actually good  and digestible
Jun 8 2019,negative, it was squeezed into infinity war and end game for a reason
Jun 8 2019,negative,horribly acted she has absolutely no charisma or any likability what so ever what a let down
Jun 8 2019,negative,crappy script and mediocre acting game brie  larson
Jun 8 2019,positive,great addition to the marvel franchise 
Jun 8 2019,positive,great movie i wish there had been a supervillian for her to fight yon rog doesnt really count
Jun 8 2019,negative,dumb movie a person more powerful than superman and added to avengers endgame in the finale of avengers fight with thanos so where cpt marvel was hiding when half of the universe was removed by thanos the critics rating over here cant be more dumb 
Jun 8 2019,positive,its alright but its a little boring at points samuel l jackson is definitely the best part of this movie though
Jun 8 2019,positive,i love brie larson and everything shes doing with the character on and offscreen this is a solid introduction into her captain marvel the movie itself did feel a bit rushed though definitely not among the worst in the mcu franchise but definitely not among the best either definitely worth checking out before endgame
Jun 8 2019,negative,boring and disappointing only watched to see hints for endgame and thats the only reason it did well in the box office 
Jun 8 2019,positive,there was not enough action but enjoyable overall
Jun 8 2019,positive,this movie is awesometrust me
Jun 8 2019,positive,excellent movie i really wish i had watched it before i watched the avengers endgame definitely a movie i would watch again
Jun 8 2019,positive,this movie was a total letdown   it doesnt have the spark as the other marvel films although the script and story was aight    absolutely nothing wowed me with captain marvels character   not even 1 scene    dont waste your gas and energy going out to watch this   just skip to avengers endgame   wait for captain marvel to go on tnt 
Jun 7 2019,negative,this movie added nothing to the mcu universe it was obvious that this movie was only made to give captain marvel a somewhat backstory for endgame very shallow i felt like they barley scratched the surface of her back story
Jun 7 2019,negative,she just doesnt fit in with the marvel universe weak performance 
Jun 7 2019,negative,it was really boring story wise while the visual effects were pleasing i wasnt invested in the movie the only reason i went to watch this movie was to see how it tied into endgame but i will now never go and see a captain marvel solo film ever again
Jun 7 2019,positive,its an origin story and its nicely done and it has a unique character looking forward to see more of captain marvel
Jun 7 2019,negative,just terrible  the acting by the lead is just horrendous  its a shame they didnt do a better job considering it was crucial to the marvel universe storyline  hope they redo it in 20 years with a better actress
Jun 7 2019,positive,amazing performances all around comically entertaining climax leaving you for more cant wait to see her in avengers end game 
Jun 7 2019,positive,it was a great movie and i liked everything about it
Jun 7 2019,positive,story was decent sam jackson is always great the bad guy from rogue one as the alien was terrible and i just feel that bree larson was the wrong casting for the role she just seemed awkward through the whole thing with this weird stern stare and clenched fists the whole movie kinda weak but par for the marvel course these days
Jun 7 2019,positive,captain marvel is a pretty basic mcu movie but still pretty good it gets a lot of hate by people being against brie larson and her comments but the movie is not terrible it has good action a pretty solid plot and very good deaging that is the main positive of this movie that the deaging of nick fury and phil coulson is so strong the skrullkree twist was a pretty good one and the final act when captain marvel gains her full powers is pretty entertaining ben mendelsohn is good and samuel l jackson is good as usual but everyone else is just okay overall this movie is not anything special but a solid movie  7910
Jun 7 2019,negative,its not the worst mcu but its not my favorite i am not a fan of poof i have powers version of superhero movies 
Jun 7 2019,positive,no wonder why there was never really any hype or mention of cm
Jun 7 2019,negative, boring nothing like the others in mcu wrong actors  not believable main character dumb move mar vell
Jun 7 2019,positive,its a great marvel movie
Jun 6 2019,positive,great movie great action 
Jun 6 2019,positive,pretty good not necessary
Jun 6 2019,negative,the superhero genre might have run its course brie was not able to carry the movie and i did not feel a connection to the character 
Jun 6 2019,positive,this movie and actually good and funny would watch again
Jun 6 2019,neutral,mostly a meh origin story
Jun 6 2019,negative,it felt like the main character just gave us pretty posters and not much else  and you had to know who the bad guy was right  i mean it was that actor who is always plays a bad guy  duh  but i liked the cat  and nick fury  
Jun 6 2019,negative,to racist and to much sexism
Jun 6 2019,neutral,just meh the story and retcons just pull you out of the movie wish i could get my money and time back  
Jun 6 2019,negative,worst mavels movie
Jun 6 2019,negative,i was interested at the start i grew up on marvel movies and comics but then i watched it i was disappointed because she lacked a character arc and was just arrogant and obnoxious she was overpowered has no real reason as to why she was picked to be captain marvel and shes just not the best role model for adolescents the plot holes are small but many i dont have a problem with brie larson i just feel like the character is painfully problematic there was a charm to it with stark but with carol its just aggravating and unnecessary how are they gonna arc that or are they leaving her like that
Jun 6 2019,positive,captain marvel is a breath of fresh air in the mcu while it does have its marvelisms the new directors really show how beautiful marvel films can be besides some spotty cgi here and there the movie is beautiful and is probably one of the better shot films of the mcu the relationship between fury and marvel is probably the most dynamic duo since thor and loki they play off each other so well honestly while i can understand why some people dont see it i can fully grasp why people think shes a bad character shes honestly better than half the characters in the mcu 
Jun 6 2019,neutral,good performance by samuel l jackson but brie larson was absolutely horrible and should not have been casted bad choice by marvel for picking her other than that the story was decent but not near the caliber of the other marvel movies
Jun 6 2019,negative,filled with scenes seemingly trying to convince me that males are evil unlikable main role
Jun 6 2019,neutral,captain marvel was an interesting installment into the mcu however it did seem like many other people have said to be just a quickly written origin story to bring one of the new banner wearers of the avengers in a postendgame world into the universe larson offers a decent portrayal but smug in delivery which makes her humor seem out of place even if some of the jokes were quite quippy the few twists that exist in the story were actually somewhat a surprise even if there is little riskreward for any of the struggles she endures throughout the film there seemed to be more focus on building her up as a leading powerful future leader of the avengers without all that messy stuff of character development and people skills which of course would never be useful in leading a squad of heroes from all backgrounds would it     as far as the politics that many were afraid of ruining the movie goes its there it isnt easily missable even if you have turned off your brain while watching it gets a bit heavy handed especially when im just a girl starts playing in a fight sequence not exactly a heart pounding track to match the fury of fisticuffsbut it does bring a laugh to the lips all the same messaging is something that is becoming prevalent in all movies of late something viewers are going to have to understand is a part of our film world now especially in franchises that are popular and such messaging can reach a broad audience one would do well to either ignore new and popular films altogether or come to the understanding that production companies see film as a way to inject a little captain planet mentality into their films to raise awareness even if we do go to movies to escape such preachiness     visually like all the newer marvel movies go this film is saturated by bluescreen animation unlike movies from 1020 years ago though it looks great and is easily accepted by your eyes until she goes binary which of course is the least realistic looking form of hers which i mean come on were watching a comic book heroine movie not a crime drama and when she finally has all the restrictions off her she becomes undoubtedly overpowered even for the most threatening of her challenges in the movie what little struggle she has in going from the amnesiac to the hero is literally just flipped on without much real discovery theres no learning curve no small scenes of whoa my hands can do that or wow i can achieve flight or i can go into hyperactive mode i hate to throw the term out there but it smacks of a mary sue version of a superhero and this divine understanding of powers she barely recollects she gained is supposed to represent real girl power come on if youre going to promote a film as such you need to work harder at showing the audience more of her reaching for and achieving that sort of leaderpowerfulrole model to show other young girls how they too can overcome just saying you are isnt enough as i said before it seems this was more of a quick origin story it also serves as an afternoon snack between marvel movies before the premier of endgame     i will say one of the most disappointing things about the movie is the discovery of how fury ended up with the eye patch after all these years and all the emphasis of the last time i trusted someone i lost an eye meme it seemed haphazardly written in that the cat would be the culprit and fury being so forgiving towards it in the aftermath for someone who would eventually become the famously grumpy shield director who would state such aforementioned quote and yet see him changed into a cat lady without any real change in tone after the swipe didnt make sense to me its not a deal breaker for the film just a disappointment in my eye would have been better carol accidentally did it to him in the discovery of her powers somehow    specific shoutout to disneymarvel for their work making samuel l jackson and clark gregg look decades younger not only did they do it exceptionally well but they also had to do it throughout the film something thus far has not been achieved as well for anything at least i have seen in my lifetime     final thoughts  not a bad movie worth watching if youre going to one day binge the assumedlysoontobeinfinitysagaboxset but definitely not something i would see a second time in the theater the story is decent animation on point and the acting was great larson could have had a bit more personality and not so stern which would counterpoint her humor better but with a universe of superheroes already oversaturated its going to be difficult to stand out even if you have all of media trying to prop you up in it
Jun 6 2019,positive,captain marvel is filled with great 90s references and adds to the already incredible marvel cinematic universe there is something off about the film that i cant place my finger on 
Jun 6 2019,positive,loved it brie larson really sold the character and played her exactly like the comic character snarky spunky and sweet
Jun 6 2019,negative,very disappointed in this movie 
Jun 5 2019,negative,i waited a while after all the bashing has sort of elapsed as a marvel comic book fan and supporter of the mcu this story crapped all over comic book continuity they rewrote the origin of marvell whyand monica rambeau i get it its not comics but this was devastating the first mcu film i did not watch in theaters 
Jun 5 2019,positive,it was pretty okay nothing groundbreaking just a moderately enjoyable scifi action film captain marvel herself was kind of weird she couldnt seem to decide whether she should be sassy or serious or i dont know just a bizarre uneven performance not enough to ruin the film for me i mostly enjoyed it but i have no desire to ever see it again
Jun 5 2019,neutral,wasnt really impressed by this im one
Jun 5 2019,positive,outstanding movie definitely one of my favorite character of the marvel clan can wait for future developments 
Jun 5 2019,positive,i like captain marvel it was the best and like goose the cat
Jun 5 2019,negative,this was by far the least enjoyable marvel movie to date the protagonist seemed aloof and smug throughout i hated this movie  
Jun 5 2019,negative,preposterous nice visual effects and photography but thats about it
Jun 5 2019,negative,worst movie of the mcu by far way too much politcal adjenda and horrible plot holes 2 hours of meh to find out how fury lost his eye  lots of action very little acting 
Jun 5 2019,positive,fun effective and a good introduction of carol danvers into the mcu
Jun 5 2019,negative,bad movie no sense of urgency the main character is way too overpowered and you never fear for her safety you also get no valid explanation as to why she was chosen to be captain marvel other than because she was a woman what made her a hero other than her powers nothing bottom 5 of mcu movies in my opinion  
Jun 5 2019,positive,it was fine genericunsuprising and brie larson isnt fit for the role
Jun 5 2019,positive,the only word that can describe the movie is disappointment plot twists are easy to predict plus why kree nation is bad and conducts genocide fury and the cat are more interesting than carol how is that even possible  movie just doesnt meet expectations
Jun 5 2019,negative,despite successful franchises brie larson fails the mcu as captain marvel it seems like a girl power movie and interrupts the continuity of the tesseract the movie lacked the quality expected of the mcu its like it was a dc live action movie
Jun 5 2019,negative,great visuals with poor acting and story that makes little sense
Jun 5 2019,positive,great visuals and special effects loved how the tied in shield and colsonfury ok story acting was good it got the job done it kept the cornyness to a minimum even for a comic book movie overall a great addition to the mcu
Jun 5 2019,positive,4 12 stars very entertaining 
Jun 5 2019,positive,a good intro of capt marvel cant wait for the next movie
Jun 4 2019,negative,well marvel has jumped the shark  this was absolute waste of time and serves only to create a timeline for the character  sjw win again  2 hours i cant get back
Jun 4 2019,negative,captain marvel fell flat no emotion from brie larson outside of cool quips and everything kind of just happens to move the plot along were flat out told carol danvers is great heroic and had to overcome things but were never shown any real struggle outside of her being doubted by men in flashbacks we never actually focus on who the character was and why we should care about her or even how she feels about discovering her past also seemed to neglect what had been laid down by past movies and the attention to detail and charm weve become accustom to in the mcu was nonexistent the writing was probably the poorest part of the film and if this a character thats suppose to anchor the mcu for years to come then some big changes need to be made for a sequel possibly even folding her into another franchise where she doesnt have to be the main player at all times
Jun 4 2019,negative,its not a good movie nothing special about it  just a generic boring movie   
Jun 4 2019,positive,movie felt really forced upon
Jun 4 2019,positive,a really fun and exciting sci fi adventure with brie larson as carol and learning how she got her powers was a crazy scene it was crazy seeing nick fury before he got the eye patch the cat was really funny and realizing what he could do was insane the scrolls were annoying and ridiculous this film will have you become a fan of carol and why shes so awesome with her powers and be glad she shows up later in avengers endgame 
Jun 4 2019,positive,love love this movie and it was a joy to watch it  i love their take on helping people out  great movie 
Jun 4 2019,positive,acting was not so good
Jun 4 2019,negative,the plot was very rushed and cliche nothing cool or eventful happen except for a few corny jokes the plot absolutely butchered the story of the vicious skrull empire  which made them so cool in the comics i understand that the films writers wanted to take a different route creatively speaking but now the skrulls are just plain waaaack the same thing was done for carol danvers her actress is very bland and stiff and this role is clearly not her forte watching brie larson play this role is like watching a fish walk its unnatural this movie is at the bottom of the barrel of marvel films next to thor the dark world and antman and the wasp
Jun 4 2019,negative,the story was very bland and its constant social justice was cringe
Jun 4 2019,negative,it was dull very dull  there is no reason for this movie to exist 
Jun 4 2019,negative,exceptionally tacky and full of holes for a movie of this budget it is one thing for fantasy movies to define its own science laws to make people fly or shoot lasers from fingers but another where they are unable to follow the logic they themselves create not entertaining either with the dialogues too contrived and cliched
Jun 4 2019,positive,captain marvelwas a fun time but i can only put it in the medium range of the mcu movies it had some pacing and character issues brie larson was good with the funny side but something misfired towards the last act
Jun 4 2019,negative,wasting of time when you dont have something to present and just waite guys look at me im super hero 
Jun 4 2019,negative,can i give it 0 stars
Jun 4 2019,positive,a solid marvel movie involving a character im not that familiar with but it was still a good lead in to end game 
Jun 4 2019,positive,you are all an incredible bunch of spoiled crybabies  i loved this movie watched it 5 times bought a ton of the comics  story and character development are fantastic  box office receipts speak for themselves
Jun 4 2019,positive,great movie great actress 
Jun 4 2019,positive,captain marvel took me on a wild ride through a lot of places and feelings on one side i know this was controversial and would be that way since i saw it opening night id still watch it again and thought it was ok b  
Jun 4 2019,negative,kinda boring  fury and colson were great goose was pretty good  the villains were forgettable as was the plot  no real bearing on the rest of the mcu  you can skip this one and miss nothing important except for how fury lost his eye
Jun 4 2019,negative,with marvel there is a high expectation and this falls so short with story and character depth what a disappointment 
Jun 4 2019,positive,great movie loved it
Jun 4 2019,positive,loved it everyone in the theater cheered through most of the movie so we couldnt hear everything that was said a definite good movie 
Jun 4 2019,negative,the cat had more character development than captain marvel
Jun 4 2019,positive,another good entry into the mcu often it tries to be something it does not try to be the best female hero doesnt need to prove itself larson is good but appears to be trying to limit her range storyline is top notch good job incorporating itself in the mcu 
Jun 4 2019,positive,it was a generic marvel movie it follows the same template as captain america 1 and thor 
Jun 4 2019,negative,really bad movie worst marvel movie yet with very cheesy lines
Jun 4 2019,negative,this is the marvel movie that nobody wanted  marvel tricked us into thinking that the all powerful captain marvel and her story were vital to avengersendgame if you havent seen either one yet spoiler alert  captain marvel plays such a small role its obvious they fit her in to appease someone  shes absent for 95 of the movie   as for this film it has its moments mostly from the 90s nostalgia soundtrack and references but other than that its a pass  brie larson was a poor choice for this character and it would have been interesting to see what someone more likeable or with the ability to show some emotion and expression would have brought to this role  heres hoping the marvel studios doesnt try to force captain marvel into the leadership role of the avengers samuel jackson does a good job as fury but i think we already had a film called the first avenger so part of this story doesnt sit well with me for that reason too   
Jun 4 2019,negative,this movie has me questioning ever seeing another super hero movie that doesnt have a satisfaction guaranteed or your money back i feel doubly cheated because not only did i spend money on this sad excuse of a movie but i wasted 2 hours of my life
Jun 4 2019,negative,very bad actress bri
Jun 3 2019,negative,no character development for captain marvel i almost left because it was so boring 
Jun 3 2019,negative,probably one of the worst marvel movies
Jun 3 2019,neutral,loved the cat and sam jackson but the story was very bland i didnt really get excited about much
Jun 3 2019,positive,captain marvel gave no apologies and i thoroughly enjoyed it the nostalgia was also nice
Jun 3 2019,positive,as a wonder woman fan i came to this movie hoping it wouldnt be a rip off it isnt loved it theres some issues with the plot but i absolutely loved the characters i need more goose
Jun 3 2019,positive,a fun origin story and it has some great moments and interactions between brie and samuel l jackson
Jun 3 2019,neutral,captain marvel was not a bad movie nor was it good for me it was almost forgettable when put next to many of the current mcu movies perhaps a decade ago it would have really stood out the sad truth is that it is probably the things that are suppose to make this movie stand tall are what bring it down for me the power of the heroine and that women are strong dont get me wrong these arent bad points in and of themselves but the concept of carol danvers power soon left me bored as she constantly slams and opposition into the ground without any kind of a challenge which generated zero excitement for me in scenes that where designed to be just that on the second point that women can be strong i felt like more then once the drama of a scene or the illusion of immersion was sacrificed on the altar of these females characters are strong which i find saddening since it has been done well in so many other movies ultimately a great villain in talos a amusing secondary character in fury and a hilarious addin in goose the cat are all smothered by their bland and uninteresting lead carol i find it a shame that the first female lead mcu movie falters by seeming to try to hard to send the message it is in a wonderful position to give and i hope that carols future in the mcu see her come into her own just as many other character have in this medium
Jun 3 2019,positive,the only problem with captain marvel is that its rushed this should have been two movies to really do the character justice and establish her as a fixture of the mcu and a player in end game the first movie should have been her as a space soldiercop and the second should have been the turn with her discovering the true nature of her fight instead this all gets short changed and is largely diminished in the process 
Jun 3 2019,positive,an mcu movie where the best parts are the side characters because the protagonist lacks any real personality
Jun 3 2019,positive,shes my absolute favorite hero
Jun 3 2019,negative,pure trash one of the most boring marvel movies yet
Jun 3 2019,neutral,this one was anticlimactic
Jun 3 2019,negative,well originally did not want to see this movie but had a 16 yr old that keep wanting to see it so we watched it last night and boy was i right not wanting to see this one my daughters both feel asleep several times throughout the movie the story was just not that good it was very dull and just plain boring also the soundtrack was way off i just couldnt connect with the songs they played its like they just didnt fit with the scenes the jokes felt like they were just added to make the film a little more vibrant but they seemed very forced overall they could have done better but i guess thats what happens when you try to force a new hero on a bigger established franchise
Jun 3 2019,negative,actions  and vilains were weak
Jun 3 2019,neutral,it feels like marvel just crammed this movie into the mix so she could be in avengers endgame and give the heros a fighting chance against thanos but as a stand alone movie its mediocre but sets up a sequel where there are other marvels
Jun 3 2019,negative,it was the worst movie of all time i would never watch it again waste of my time 
Jun 3 2019,negative,i tried to give this movie a fair chance but poor casting of the main lead and boring writing ultimately killed it for me     this movie was supposed to be about female empowerment but i found that captain marvel lacked any relatable traits whatsoever you can be a tough aggressive woman while still having a compassionate heart and a good sense of humor i assumed that after removing her control wed maybe see that it suppressed her human emotions but nah    for fans of the marvel universe the most that this movie seemed to have was flashy fight scenes that will keep your kids entertained but thats about it i would even go so far to argue that nick fury developed more as a character than captain marvel herself and any scenes with him were a breath of fresh air those were the only saving graces for me  
Jun 3 2019,positive,imperative viewing for any avengers  marvel fan and should be seen before avengers endgame covers a lot of material from normal woman to superhero with more heart than some
Jun 3 2019,negative,not that good honestly 
Jun 3 2019,positive,powerful thrilling and ready to lead marvel into the future 
Jun 3 2019,neutral,uninspiring and predictable
Jun 3 2019,negative,meh this was only sort of good the graphics were well done chemistry between brie and sam was good too everything else like the plot narrative and dialogue was mediocre at best captain marvels personality wasnt any good she wasnt charismatic nor did i have much intrigue in her emotionally as a character plus you can tell the feminist undertone within the story which didnt work well with the film it made it seem as if men are misogynistic and that women need to be the boss or something news flash women can also be terrible to women 
Jun 3 2019,positive,very good movie the ending was a little confusing because it doesnt start off explaining that veer was on a different planet but they do later on filled with adventure and a big twist ending
Jun 3 2019,positive,with only a handful of really memorable marvel moments it really fell flatter than i thought it would captain marvel herself has some really strange storylines in that she just disappears into space at times for unexplained reasons not a terrible origin story but ive seen better from the likes of marvel infinity war makes up for this lackluster performance 
Jun 3 2019,positive,i like it yes it pushes its own agenda but it is still a great movie it has lost its rewachability though
Jun 3 2019,positive,fun movie and goose makes it great 
Jun 2 2019,negative,horriblewhat a waste 
Jun 2 2019,positive,captain marvel is inspiring funny wellacted and visually stunningignore any haters its amazing specially if you have daughters who are desperate to see female superheroes on the big screen 
Jun 2 2019,neutral,the worth cocktail ever
Jun 2 2019,positive,this movie lived up to my expectations of a marvel movie loved it
Jun 2 2019,neutral,some decent ideas but could have been so much better
Jun 2 2019,positive,it was very fun and entertaining a lot more lighthearted jokes than i anticipated
Jun 2 2019,negative,i rarely not finish a movie but this was one time i did
Jun 2 2019,positive,the movie does nothing spectacular but it still manages to deliver a decent storyline and also a really good music playlist    brie larson really deliver a good performance as captain marvel she really embodied it i urge ppl to watch the movie with no agenda and u will enjoy it though the jokes were cringe but others i would recommend ppl to watch it
Jun 2 2019,negative,lack of character development corny action overall film could had been better 
Jun 2 2019,positive,if you watched all the previous movies from marvel studios youll realize how much powerful captain marvel introduced for her first appearance
Jun 2 2019,positive,its underrated due to audiences who cant let go of their egos  its an enjoyable movie with good humour and action
Jun 2 2019,negative,i wasnt really worth watching 
Jun 2 2019,negative,can we get a do over
Jun 2 2019,positive,i loved this movie and how bada she is 
Jun 2 2019,positive,i had to say i dont see why people hate this movie its so good it has layers and character is so well represented and briel and samuel j are so good together i havent seen mrjackson had that good partner in the movie for long time   i love how well they peel captain marvel character and how strong she is from inside   they remove all that wonder woman  physical attraction and added strong will anger and real problems that we can identified with  im glad to see strong woman with will to defy all that is real problem in the world today i love that she has the desire to protect those who are abused and underprivileged and that she do not act all mighty but she is angry and not in control  and i love that even more cuz she shows how human she is  not all mighty or special    i dont see her in all that cinematography sh i dont see her as a super model  no i see her as a true hero and i praise  marveldisney and all cast for deliver movie these real this strong as captain marvel
Jun 2 2019,positive,its really not terrible but its nothing groundbreaking either larsons acting wasnt great granted and the story seems too familiar but after a slow and borderline unenjoyable first half i laughed and i enjoyed the film
Jun 2 2019,positive,if you judge this film individually without considering the fact that its a part of mcu  it seems like a fun entertaining film but in reality because its coming after so many great marvel movies unfortunately looked a bit pale in comparison to the other ones brie larson didnt do a bad job but i feel her characterization was weak as someone who is probably the most strongest superhero in the lineup  her character and personality traits lacked the ingredients of emotion vulnerability  struggle she never looked being challenged with difficulties and seemed too overpowered against the oppositions and that wasnt right atleast for a superhero movie that trait is a big no
Jun 2 2019,negative,a dull movie and a waste of time solid visuals and performances all around this instalment of the mcu is let down massively by writing both for the plot and the lead this is a movie you can skip
Jun 2 2019,negative,what couldve been great was a disaster dull predictable story awesome character assassinated by a bad actress samuel l and the cat are the only positives in this movie
Jun 2 2019,positive,is a very good movie fun exciting loving write photography music etc the lead role es light nice funny happy and loveable one of the things that i liked most is that the protagonist had no love interest and that breaks all the stereotypes of superheroes 
Jun 2 2019,negative,cm just seemed kinda bland and the plot was too generic for me i may be bias but i expect a lot more from marvel movies 
Jun 2 2019,negative,shes utterly revolving
Jun 2 2019,negative,dull and uninspired like a cardboard cut out of an mcu film
Jun 2 2019,positive,wasnt too sure what to expect from this given the politicization surrounding it reviews id read seemed a bit lukewarm while trying to be positive so i was concerned it would be rather mediocre     actually the reviews were pretty spot on in their positivity without going overboard this was a good fun movie brie larsen was very affable in the lead role and sam jackson was as enjoyable as ever the supporting cast all do excellent jobs  particularly anette benning and jude laws pretty good too the actions engaging and the special effects looked pretty great noticeably better than the trailers     the highlight for me as a marvel comics fan was getting to see the kree and the skrulls the kree civilization in particular is showcased here and we get to see more of it than we have in previous marvel movies so that was a treat    there are better marvel movies than this and its another origin story when said and done still its entertaining exciting and fun just as weve come to expect from the mcu its really not something that such a fuss shouldve been kicked up about by internet warriors whatever message about female empowerment is here is very general and hardly exceptionable or particularly intrusive it takes a back seat to the superheroics not the greatest thing ever but definitely a good movie and another plus in the greatest winning streak in cinema history 
Jun 2 2019,negative,one of the weakea mcu films totaly overhyped the acting is mostly good all but the main heroe the acting is very poor i guess it has to do with how the heroin is writen and it is writen bad and feels forced with many bad lines   i could not find any connection or sympathy with this character 
Jun 2 2019,negative,it was meh  too try hard with pc discourse  they made nick fury look like a bafoon just to make capt marvel look better  kinda pathetic  watchable but wont buy for my marvel collection
Jun 2 2019,negative,havent regretted watching a movie like this since anaconda
Jun 2 2019,positive,great movie and answered a lot of questions 
Jun 2 2019,negative,captain marvel may be the worst mcu movie 
Jun 2 2019,positive,couldve been great but wasnt half bad basic
Jun 2 2019,positive,overall pretty decent a few scenes seemed forced
Jun 1 2019,positive,great to see a female hero
Jun 1 2019,positive,lots of origin story in it and captain marvel is a badass
Jun 1 2019,negative,it sucks alita battle angel did better
Jun 1 2019,positive,i know a lot of people have been calling this movie a lityle messy and that brie larson had no personality in it but i  actually saw it as the exact opposite it had great performances from both jackson and larson with a fitting origin story for a new hero in the mcu
Jun 1 2019,positive,this movie was everything i had hoped it would be 
Jun 1 2019,negative,poorly written joke of a movie
Jun 1 2019,positive,it was good not the best super hero movie but it wasnt bad 
Jun 1 2019,positive,captain marvel is midtier mcu not remotely great but not remotely bad larson gives a strong and charismatic lead performance as the titular hero and sam jacksons young nick fury makes for an entertaining secondary character working beside marvel and displays some mindblowing cgi theres nothing entirely different or unique about captain marvel not much that sets it apart from other mcu origin stories its a fine fun but ultimately forgettable effort
Jun 1 2019,positive,great movie loved every minute of it
Jun 1 2019,positive,people nuts this was awesome
Jun 1 2019,positive,it was action packed and amazing
Jun 1 2019,positive,excellent mood so nostalgic with all of the 90s references i would speculate that many who dont like it are young and dont understand all of the throwbacks that make this film so entertaining 
Jun 1 2019,positive,definitely not one of my favorite marvel movies but had enough to keep me interested in the storyline fell short of expectations for me
Jun 1 2019,negative,this is just shit dont watch it
Jun 1 2019,negative,boring movie script seemed to be all over the place  acting was below par but we did like some of the graphics  this movie seemed rushed due to endgames she was not the right person for this role came off lifeless and stale  the only reason it was a box office hit was due to the avenger name she could not have done this well alone
Jun 1 2019,positive,has some good moments but not on par with other marvel origin movies
Jun 1 2019,positive,not as bad as people say imo interesting story and characters brie is alright    cons doesnt add much new not very memorable
Jun 1 2019,negative,poorly written 1 decent action scene in entire movie some bad attempt at humor
Jun 1 2019,negative,the point where you say well it could have been better at that moment you know this film has failed condescending and arrogant  she may have made a good villain but as a hero she has much to learn 
Jun 1 2019,neutral,mediocre predictable origin story with few thrills over hyped
Jun 1 2019,positive,brilliant movie and the story is also very good  
Jun 1 2019,positive,love this movie  my favorite origin story by far
Jun 1 2019,positive,it was funny and a great adventure thoroughly enjoyed it
Jun 1 2019,negative,dialogue seemed off in timing and writing was poor didnt care for the lack of reaction losing an eye     overall brie didnt seem a good fit and chemistry was overall lacking
Jun 1 2019,negative,this would have been an amazing one shot short film  the acting wasnt great the story wasnt great and the character wasnt really anything to get excited for  not as bad as thor 2 or ironman 2 but definitely one of the worse mcu films
May 31 2019,positive,average marvel movie that simply did the job of telling a backstory to a new character in end game
May 31 2019,neutral,i was expecting more fury saves the day or the movie in this case
May 31 2019,negative,really bad acting and just bad writing the jokes fell flat i have a feeling they set this character up to have a lesbian relationship with the single mom which would have been cool for me but the characters have zero style or oh whats the word life no feeling behind anything in this movienot required for end game
May 31 2019,negative,and they said unplanned was preachy i was really hoping for this to be good and i walked in with an open mind so much 90s nostalgia not really tasteful mixed with feminist empowerment messages weve all become tired of hearing i enjoy a good female superhero but unfortunately wonder woman is still the only one with a good standalone movie at this point   sam l jackson did an excellent early character portrayal and there was an ok plot twist but thats it larson is a good actress but her face acting here was laughable  theres a reason disney bought off this website to change the rating system
May 31 2019,neutral,mediocre action movie
May 31 2019,positive,well ive finally watched all the marvel films in chronological order up to endgame now just need to find someone to come the cinema with me who either hasnt been to see endgame yet or doesnt mind watching it twice my thoughts on captain marvel areit was ok the music and visuals were awesome the central character annoyingly smug and emotionally unconvincing the plot mixed fury was great as always and there were some interesting ideas but it wasnt one of my favourite marvels looking forward to finishing this off with endgame
May 31 2019,negative,it didnt feel like a marvel movie it had a lot of hamfisted political commentary if they wanted to do super hero movie with an ultra powerful lady they should have taken a page from the book of wonder woman a strong charismatic lead in a war movie were the hero just so happens to be a woman not a movie were the hero is a hero because she is a woman every major character feels shoehorned into being a woman as though the director cast a group of woman and then wrote the story around it i gave it two stars because at minimum i got what i expected to an extent i got a superhero that punched things in the facesometimes sometimes she punched things in the face mostly she just stared at the other actors with a face of mild bewilderment 
May 31 2019,positive,fury losing his eye in the fashion he did was the dumbest thing ever absolutely 0 payoff from the winter soldier easter egg other than that it was enjoyable to me some things could have been better i think the somewhat poor directing of the movie at parts made bries performance look very very cringe but other than that i actually enjoyed it i enjoyed seeing young cgi fury and coulson talos was hands down the best part of this movie overall not amazing have some issues with it but my enjoyment outweighed my gripes which is why i have it rated a lot higher than a lot of other reviews 455
May 31 2019,positive,totally awesome finally we have a female marvel heroine we can all love 
May 31 2019,negative,terrible movie with bad acting and poor cgi
May 31 2019,positive,at least clearly above end game in being able to keep you awake
May 31 2019,negative,godawful boring and frankly juvenile 
May 31 2019,positive,captain marvel is the best of the worst mcu films thor dark world age of ultron iron man 2 brie larson is great in the room as carol danvers she comes off very cookie cutter  the humor is flat i always assume fury has something clever to say but not here  the whole 90s vibe and music feels forced the origin of things such as furys eye feels forced or really random  marvel set the bar really high and captain marvel is a very middle of the road mcu film
May 31 2019,neutral,it had little impact on me after i saw it the twists were more or less predictable and the audience doesnt discover them along with the characters creating a disconnect there is nothing inherently bad about this its still a competently made movie and the acting for the most part is a ok i wasnt a huge fan of bree larsons performance for character who everyone else in the film says needs to control her emotions she doesnt really show any emotions the movie is bland but not bad there are a few laughs here and there and everything with nick fury is great once the characters make it to earth the plot really begins to pick up
May 31 2019,negative,a huge ms marvel fan who has waiting 15 years for this brie larson has made this movie virtually unwatchable and ruined the potential this great character she is flat smug and lacks any real warmth this could have been great movie with a different lead i think having the 80s90s version of rembeau is preferable  how she got this role is beyond me
May 31 2019,positive,dont let the trolls dissuade you this is a fitting portrayal for my favorite marvel character 
May 31 2019,positive,captain marvel is not  the best mcu movies but it is a great way to tell the story of one of the strongest superhero captain marvel is definitely a good movie to watch during saturday night
May 31 2019,positive,loved this film love brie larson give me more
May 30 2019,negative,if it wasnt for the bit and pieces of humor i would give it 0 stars this movie wasnt bad it just felt rather pointless i liked the character of captain marvel but the movie was just kind of bland
May 30 2019,negative,was not what i expectedthere better be a muslim lead for when captain marvel trains miss marvel
May 30 2019,positive,great action  cool story  brie larson kicks 
May 30 2019,positive,needed a little more plot development
May 30 2019,negative,captain marvel was a bad character 
May 30 2019,negative,marvel flick total embarrassment garbage movie waste of time the only redeeming quality is humor an award winning actress is associated with this flick i feel bad for her pos film
May 30 2019,positive,its not the best but its a good start
May 30 2019,negative,extremely disappointing instalment in the mcu  feels more like a forced character introduction than a true standalone film  the character arc is formulaic at best and mind numbing at worst   its a throughly skippable movie i can only presume that the high box office numbers are a product of endgame hype and faux controversy
May 30 2019,positive,this is a good movie that should have been a great one the real problem is a case of show it dont say it     the whole contain your emotions narrative amounted to nothing as containing her emotions never seemed to prevent her from accomplishing anything she wants to do and at no point did using her emotions allowed her to overcome anything she overpowers the dampening device on her neck using the powers she already had and her emotions never entered into the equation    we dont see her undergoing any growth as a character we arent shown her overcoming or discovering anything internal and even external she only overcomes her new enemy through use of the power she already has    she learns that the side she is fighting for is wrong and just flips like a switch    it would have been great to see some sense of betrayal and anger in her reaction to leaning of the memory wipe some sense of reluctance to having to combat her old teammates could they have been just as misinformed by the supreme intelligence as carole was about the evil of the skrulls    how about some inner conflict upon realizing the atrocities she has committed against the skrulls how many innocent people has she massacred before learning the truth what effect does it have on her emotional wellbeing    she should show at least some of the five stages of loss denial anger bargaining depression and acceptance whether for the loss of her previous life  memories or loss of the innocent lives she has taken    the only sense of emotion we do get from her is when maria tells her about the person she was before the memory wipe it would be great for her to deal with what she has gone through instead of ignoring it completely have her spend time with her friend talking about what she has gone through her fears hopes and dreams    the big stand up scene tended to fall flat for me because we never got the chance to feel her being down and having to fight her way up she was always strong emotionally and from the point of the accidental power absorption from the exploding energy core she is always powerful    if you want to see the stand up story done well watch spiderman into the spiderverse    now for some blatant nitpicking  never in the entire history of gocarting has anyone ever mocked someone by telling them you should slow down  yelling for them to speed up or get out of the way sure but using you should slow down as a taunt never    the only time i have ever heard it said is as advice for approaching a turn not a taunt    a fun movie but needed more work
May 30 2019,negative,100 worst film in the mcu  zero character development  zero personality 
May 30 2019,positive,its a passable marvel movie but only just kind of like mom buying you the off brand of blue jeans instead of the cool ones itll work but its not what you really want
May 30 2019,positive,i just loved the whole movie it was full of action and heartfelt moments this is an absolute mustsee
May 30 2019,positive,greatbetter than most marvel productions
May 30 2019,positive,captain marvel is a movie that excels in its third act hero moment when that comes on your screen not only does the screen light up but also the score hightens the scene so much that you will remember it long after the movie closes out i mean i keep watching it again captain marvel as a movie stands strong not because of its directing but from its lead actress and oscar winning brie larson and with supporting roles by lashana lynch sam jackson and the brilliant ben mendlsohn who is clearly underappreciated as an actor but after this movie you would love his acting skills him and larson have the best scenes in the movie also the screenplay does a clever job of bringing out character development that you only wish were a bit stronger but nevertheless the movie excels at making you root for captain marvel as a superhero even though her power skills are a bit shaky
May 30 2019,positive,fun movie with a great soundtrack
May 30 2019,negative,this movie was horrible boring and a waste of 
May 30 2019,negative,boring until the final fight
May 30 2019,positive,this movie so fucking great i enjoyed it 
May 30 2019,negative,just finished watching this this movie stink and sucks 
May 30 2019,negative,wasnt bad wasnt great it was meh brie larsons persona in interviews and online in general is also quite hard to see past when watching captain marvel shame 
May 30 2019,negative,lost and dizzy no memories where am i whats going on thats how i felt about this movie
May 30 2019,neutral,probably one of the weakest entries in the mcu the trippy backtothe90s feature fails on many many levels all of which have been a staple of mcu action comedy and its failed story arc
May 30 2019,positive,my favorite female hero in the mcu series
May 30 2019,positive,great movie the plot and characters were awesome i enjoyed it from beginning and to end
May 30 2019,positive,the chemistry between the main character captain marvel with her costars and the numerous fast action stunts
May 30 2019,positive,great build up in the story
May 30 2019,positive,very interesting story good twist super effects
May 30 2019,negative,i dont know why but i feel bored watching this
May 30 2019,positive,fun movie to watch not the best mcu film but far from the worst
May 30 2019,negative,strange choices and bad storyline cat was good though
May 30 2019,negative,overhyped not that good of a storyline
May 30 2019,positive,i liked it good movie great action awesome cgi fun sound track i took one star off for brie larsons performance i thought she was kinda dull that might have been the directing but i would have liked a more interesting performance out of all the mcu lead characters brie larsons captain marvel was the worst     but still good and better than any dceu movies by far that is my only complaint other than that its the usual problem i have with marvel movies all together now  no interesting villains this movie is no different captain marvel really doesnt have a formidable villain     i liked thanos hella and the vulture thats all the villains that were interesting in the mcu so far
May 30 2019,positive,wholesome movie about a woman with amazing power
May 30 2019,negative,i wasnt that impressed larsons performance was mediocre at best the movie was trying to hard and the jokes were just lame 
May 30 2019,positive,i watched this film postendgame so my familiarity with captain marvel was at a bare minimum going into itat least in terms of the carol danvers version the original captain marvel dates back to the dawn of the comic book age and was actually the character of shazam through a fascinating roller coaster of events marvel ended up with the rights to the name of captain marvel while dc kept the rights to the actual character  as the movie progressed through vers trying to discover her identity i found myself just as confused as the character as to who she was and the powers she was able to wield  while they attempt to rectify this by the end of the film we dont really know a heck of a lot more than we did when it started  carol danvers the air force pilot and carol danvers the ultrapowerful superhero still feel like two different characters at the end  it also feels like captain marvel was not in the original plans for the mcu and instead feels tacked on whether or not thats true i dont know  this was my issue with captain marvel in endgame as she didnt feel like an organic extension of the avengers  captain marvel may not have warranted the hate that some of her most vocal critics have lobbed at her but shes also not the feminist messiah her most ardent supporters have crowned her as either   
May 30 2019,negative,worse than ironman 3
May 29 2019,positive,good movie not great captain marvel was too stiff and dry i would rewatch but on the lower end of marvel movies
May 29 2019,negative,bad acting followed by an even worse story loved the comics the movie not so much
May 29 2019,positive,inspirational for women tried to make some good jokes but humors and jokes cant burst out
May 29 2019,negative,dont waste your time and money
May 29 2019,positive,all the hate for this movie pushed it out of my mind for a while but today i sat down and gave it a chance and man it is really good    this is in my mind the best marvel origin movie since captain americas first outing back in 2011 all i heard about was how awful an actor brie was but she shows plenty of emotion throughout the movie in fact a central plot point is her controlling her emotions people judge too harshly based on trailers these days     i totally loved seeing samuel l jackson in his youth again and seeing nick fury in a light id never known before the visuals are absolutely stunning except one personal view is i dont much like the glowing of captain marvel it seems a little too animeish for my taste everything but that though is beautiful and it has a solid though somewhat cliche story     it was also the most humorous marvel film since guardians of the galaxy it really nailed most of its jokes     overall this is a really good film one that had me jawdropped at times and its theme is not one we see enough of in these modern times to always understand a story from all angles before casting judgment i give it a 5 out of 5 
May 29 2019,positive,cool storyline i liked how she developed to realize her capabilities very good explanation of how she got her powers i enjoyed the movie this is where it all began
May 29 2019,positive,entertaining and effective like most of the marvel movies
May 29 2019,negative,main character has no personality this is one of the worst mcu movie i have ever seen
May 29 2019,negative,another generic actionhero movie there is no original idea in the scrip nor the directing
May 29 2019,negative,not the best movie from marvel bad storyscript and acting 
May 29 2019,positive,captain marvel was good to watch the story was not as strong as we hoped it would be i think it fell short of giving a great story like dcs wonder woman wonder woman was more driven to do the right thing than captain marvel which i thought she was trying to prove something to everyone until the end same thing in the avengers endgame i think her character fell short of being as strong as the other women in endgame
May 29 2019,positive,the movie was fantastic it had some great fight scenes and a really cool plot
May 29 2019,positive,the hate this movie seems to get from a lot of the viewing audience is confusing to me its not a great movie but a lot of the mcu arent great movies why did this one not get a pass like some of the others have it was a perfectly watchable movie albeit nothing groundbreaking or worth going out of your way to see
May 29 2019,positive,great installment to the marvel series the story is ok and you feel nostalgic watching this because of the timeline it is base in action was good but needed to get to the point alittle faster 
May 29 2019,neutral,movie was good the main character had no emotion i found myself siding with the skrulls because they had personalities
May 29 2019,positive,its a great movie just like the rest of the marvel movies i will have to read the comments to understand what the deal is with the 56 audience score i took my 5 year old and she sat through the whole movie thats a rarity as all parents know 
May 29 2019,positive,i enjoyed captain marvel i thought brie larson did a good job as carol danvers samuel l jacksonnick fury had a great supporting role which made this film even more entertaining lashana lynch was pretty good as well
May 29 2019,positive,such a great movie ive seen it four times and each times i discover more i like i especially like the message about picking yourself up when youre knocked down 
May 29 2019,negative,movie lacked character development didnt really feel attached to brie larson character and cus of that i started watching something on another tab i also dont think she was the best guy to play her something about her just isnt right with me but what do i know 
May 29 2019,negative,weak and a pointless addition to the mcu 
May 29 2019,negative,with an excellent supporting cast i expected more from captain marvel however it felt far too forced and rushed with its placement in the mcu canon if youve followed carol danvers in her many installments and versions in the comics and marvel animation this is definitely not her best as cliche as this sounds i believe captain marvel would have been much better portrayed by a more rounded lead such as yvonne strahovski or emily blunt definitely the least of marvels films even without taking into account the furor regarding identity politics and virtue signalling 
May 29 2019,positive,its a fun ride to sit through but doesnt do much for me to love the titular character like the first iron man and captain america movies but nonetheless is another action filled popcorn flick that adds more word building to the forever growing mcu 
May 29 2019,positive,movie was a little bit longer than necessary
May 29 2019,negative,another lecture on the evils of the male species
May 29 2019,negative,i think i cant trust rotten tomatoes to give honest reviews of movies anymore  how e it was worth it 
May 29 2019,negative,the main actress which is horrible beyond all sense of reason bree cannot act by any means the entire movie she has no emotion cannot emote anything and is just completely monotone her super strength or in super powers are never explained its literally like watching power rangers all over again she punches her powers out from her body it could have been pretty funny if she just said mighty morphin power rangers through one of her fight scenes movie takes place in 1985 how were there playing music from 1995 which i did not understand i think you need to be very very very high to enjoy this movie
May 29 2019,positive,starts out strong but loses its distinctiveness about halfway through like the character thought the plot got too predictable in the second half
May 29 2019,positive,amazing funny badass higher further faster baby screw dudebros and the fake reviews 
May 29 2019,negative,was terrible do not waste your time or money only bright spot was samuel l and the cat
May 29 2019,positive,i loved it super cool seeing a superhero woman the story is really great and brie larson did an amazing performance strongly recommend
May 29 2019,negative,terrible movie  why create a great kill squad just to see them get wiped out    minnerva a seasoned veteran assasin killed by a jet fight  come on really   seriously wasted my time watching this crap
May 29 2019,negative,worst marvel movie ever 100 propaganda
May 28 2019,negative,im not a troll this movie is just really bad i dont see how it got 77
May 28 2019,negative,i really wanted to like this movie but found it rather disappointing and boring one of the worst mcu movies so far i was so looking forward to marvel finally having a movie with a strong female lead but this was not it they should have done black widow a long long time ago 
May 28 2019,positive,a lot lower on my list of my favourite mcu movies but still enjoyable highlight being ben mendelsohn and young samuel l jackson
May 28 2019,negative,a film that feels completely outofstep with the larger mcu  this film either ignores characters and story lines that came before it or it damages those characters and story lines in irreparable ways  beyond these serious issues there was no soul to this film whatsoever and the dialogue was just awful  when the most likable character in your movie is a cgi cat you should really reassess whether the film is even worth making  goodbye mcu  
May 28 2019,positive,great addition to the mcu  i think the lead could have been cast better but bire larsen is ok  will definately see it multiple times and add it to my collection when available
May 28 2019,positive,its a standard marvel origin story movie better than thor about as good as cpt america 1
May 28 2019,negative,the movie was a turn off  the captain marvel character was not believable  you fly in space through an entire ship as its exploding and you then you have trouble fighting an ordinary human with a sword  just stupid and it insults our intelligence as the audience  plus shes overly arrogant  just not an enjoyable movie to watch
May 28 2019,negative,after movie ended  all i remembered is i stare to the ceiling and watching the light spots the movie is an okay movie if you dont read marvel comics and dont watch the avenger series ms marvel and fury were so out of characters in this one de age fury is good at funny scene but his action movements were too slow didnt make you feel like he is a youngmiddle age agent jackie chan in foreigner is much quicker and realistic th fury in marvel the happy go lucky agent and origin of how he became one eyed is just meh the main actress is good at sad scene but for other scene  she usually bad looks like she is bore tbhthe opening scene dialogues esp the plot is uninteresting and you can see the twists miles away and the plot holes the action scenes in the movie are basic i even suspect the movie  is made by asylum production if not for the expensive cgs the cgs  they are great  the landscapes are real treat to eyes these cgs and the cat is the only saving grace of the movie they threw alot of things in the movie as nostalgia of 90s but the songs are not so 90s there is one scene when peoples are waiting impatiently at disc loading in actual 90s  people are used to loading coz that is already fastest available thing in 90s i dont know why aliens are hiding in game roomrecreational room too or the terrasect in some junk box there is this girl born from single mother that want her mom to go to war rather then being with her too usually you would want your mom to be with you than encourage her to go om dangerous missions  isnt it i suspect this movie can make your iq goes down 1the plotholes 2 the bad flashbacks 3the dialogues 4the predictable twists5 bad action sequences predictable near deaths of some characters something like dont stare at your family so lovingly when there is a shootouts 6wrong 90s theme 7hero suit design i remembered atleast three suit that goes better with ms marvel 8pure lucky way of getting super powerway too lucky no ups and downs no responsibility 9no good villain just your typical gruntsthe accuser was a lie 10 deaged fury with aging actions 11 furys one eyed revelation 12 captain marvel personality in movie are serious turnoffs imo 1 cgs are good  still marvel class  esp planet scenery and deage fury2 the scenes are beautifulesp her friend house and surrounding 3 if you think of this movie as low budget buddy cop movie everything is bearable  just dont be too focus like me i so hate how they potrayed fury and captain marvel on this one
May 28 2019,positive,it was a heart pounding adventure never had me bord
May 28 2019,positive,refreshing to see a female superhero who isnt forced to highlight her sex appeal  pander to narrowminded physical expectations to be considered relevant she is subtle in her emotions incredibly strong and stable has all of the most powerful abilities and a strong character arc     the story is great lots of action comedy tears great vfx fantastic movie
May 28 2019,negative,to political keep politics out of our movies
May 28 2019,negative,simply awfulsjw pandering
May 28 2019,positive,not my favorite marvel movie but still lots of fun nonetheless brie larson and samuel l jackson shine and the story was fantastic highly recommend
May 28 2019,negative,pushed too hard for the political agendastorycharacterdialogueall sacrificed 
May 28 2019,positive,captain marvel as a movie is trying too hard to sell viewer the fact that its a movie about female superhero and its ruining the potential of the movie  i like brie as a captain marvel but she needs to work on her acting skills because she was trying to blend two extreme sides of two different characters together and it was just too awkward and fake if she toned down the i am a hero act and im funny act it would go together way better than it actually ends up being in the movie    in the end i was able to have some fun with the movie but i wouldnt call it a great experience like with some other mcu movies
May 28 2019,negative,boring and wrong choice for a leading actress too much endorsement from the hollywood press as a special movie made me hate it even more
May 28 2019,positive,loved the iron will of the carol danvers to always be her best and overcome obstacles  especially men who can she cant girls need more of this also really enjoyed the 90s nostalgia 
May 28 2019,negative,really boring 2nd and 3rd act such potential wasted wasnt thrilled with bries acting much either definitely the least rewatchable mcu film for me
May 28 2019,negative,she is awful the movie has no purpose but brie is unforg
May 28 2019,positive,goose the cat is  the best part of the movie  captain marvel is s phenomenal movie 
May 28 2019,negative,horrible desperate try to get another girl super hero for our pc community  fucking ridiculous that she is the new wildcardsavior to the marvel team in endgame
May 28 2019,positive,do you remember that time that mcu did that horrible unwatchable movie no you dont because they never did  captain marvel is yet another enjoyable and forgettable story in a universe that is really getting overpopulated now is there anyone without power left  anyway things i liked without spoilers nin tshirt the cat more nicholas joseph fury than usual  things that freaked me out nicholas joseph fury face  things i did not like plot inconsistencies not a single new thing in it
May 28 2019,positive,i thought this movie was very entertaining and played well in the marvel universe it is one of the better origin stories out there a must see if you are a marvel fan 
May 28 2019,negative,one star is for samuel l jackson another one is for alienkitty goose chewie sadly but nothing more
May 28 2019,positive,better than i thought it would be captain marvel came off as a bit arrogant and stiff still enjoyed the movie
May 28 2019,negative,this movie felt rushed and the storyline so poorly written they couldve taken their time but honestly total ruined her future in the marvel universe not recommended 
May 28 2019,positive,it teaches the kids that even thoughyou have problems if you really want  you can overcome them and get  strong er with each obstacle in your life
May 28 2019,negative,this one seriously fell short brie larson has no personality here and comes across as arrogant and unlikable
May 28 2019,negative,its a marvel movie so its bound to look amazing but the way they managed a strong female role makes the entire movie cringe while movies like wonder woman just show you a strong female main this has the need of a giant screen shouting at you at every dialoge 
May 27 2019,negative,low end mcu and actress poisoned it even before it hit the box office made me worry about end game thank god she did not mess up that movie
May 27 2019,positive,its not my favourite marvel film i dont like the idea of one hero having so much power however i do feel that its a solid addition to the franchise and i will always love seeing samuel l jackson as nick fury especially an origin story
May 27 2019,positive,i thought the movie was incredible great for girl power and just for setting up this section of the mcu also samuel l jackson was amazing
May 27 2019,positive,i very much enjoyed this addition to the mcu bree did a fantastic job and i especially loved the explanation of how fury ost his eye fantastic 
May 27 2019,positive,its decent but definitely not one of the better marvel movies
May 27 2019,negative,it gets a two for samuel l jacksons save 
May 27 2019,negative,boring mediocre and preachy
May 27 2019,positive,was a good entertaining movie  
May 27 2019,neutral,if you are looking for a film to watch in a very boring day with nothing else to do then this is the film very boring and the actress is just terrible aside that i think the plot its kind of interesting and the performance of samuel l jackson may worth watching this film 
May 27 2019,positive,safe yet entertaining with its action humor and character interactions  
May 27 2019,positive,good story mixes quite well with the marvel universe
May 27 2019,positive,liked the back story and how some of the characters from guardians of the galaxy made an apperance
May 27 2019,positive,best marvel superhero movie and best marvel superhero movie ever i seen it and i loved it im totally going to get it on bluray and dvd in june 
May 27 2019,negative,dont waste your money i knew disney would ruin marvel as they did star wars
May 27 2019,negative,terrible in plot acting music cinematography  
May 27 2019,positive,better than i thought interesting and full of information
May 27 2019,positive,i love this movie its a great addition to the mcu and i cannot wait to have it in my collection
May 27 2019,positive,not what i thought it would be well actually i never knew anything about this one but i liked it
May 27 2019,positive,entertaining but not as exciting as the other marvel movies i found the main character to be more annoying and trying to be overlycocky rather than inspiring
May 27 2019,negative,i was incredibly disappointed by this movie brie larson is not great and is barely given anything to work with including a personality shes the lead by the way samuel l jackson delivers solid work as usual ben mendelsohn does very well a story i could fall asleep to and action that kind of makes me queasy in how poorly done it is
May 27 2019,positive,loved the movie after seeing the movie i have a better understanding of unexplained things in the other movies
May 27 2019,negative,bad easily the worst marvel film made even worse than thor the dark world
May 27 2019,positive,a fun movie not as good as other marvel movies but entertaining nonetheless
May 27 2019,positive,not the best not the worst great visual effects im kind of tired of the cliche women have it so hard storyline the character also seems overpowered to fit into the avengers story
May 27 2019,positive,somehow after 20 movies marvel studios is still able to deliver a gem of an origin story
May 27 2019,negative,dreadful acting boring superhero with no personality and she is monotone throughout the entire movie hard to watch 
May 26 2019,positive,a very relevant movie  captain marvel is a beast
May 26 2019,positive,great movie very beneficial to the backstory preceding endgame
May 26 2019,negative,its a feminist movie thats not really that good brie larson shows no emotion and did not sell me the idea of her  actually being captain marville 
May 26 2019,positive,samuel l jackson at his best laughs and a plot twist make up for a messy plot structure
May 26 2019,positive,very entertaining and holds your attention all the way through
May 26 2019,negative,got tricked into seeing this movie had nothing to do with end game
May 26 2019,positive,one of my favorites
May 26 2019,positive,perfect had this captain marvel been introduced in endgame thanos wouldve been quaking in his boots the moment he found out nebula was time traveling
May 26 2019,negative,her power is believing in herself see what your trying to do marvel worth the whole woman inpowerment stuff but just dont make a movie just to have a female lead
May 26 2019,positive,not my favorite marvel movie but a good introduction to a new character that is needed to understand her role in the infinity wars saga
May 26 2019,positive,the 1st thor of the modern mcu 
May 26 2019,positive,i went in thinking this would be my least favorite superhero movie i came out thinking this could be one my favorite superhero movies
May 26 2019,positive,captain marvel feels almost like an after thought at this point in the marvel universe while the character and story is compelling brie didnt quite pull me in on this one the pacing and effects reminded me of dragon ball z which is both good and bad that being said id love to see this same creative team get together for a dragon ball z film
May 26 2019,positive,love the 90s feel still dont understand why she is captain marvel but it was a good movie 
May 26 2019,positive,i loved the nick fury backstory and it was great to see coulson on the big screen again 
May 26 2019,positive,love this movie so happy to see carol danvers on the big screen   
May 26 2019,positive,nick fury and the cat were the only thing this movie really had going for it i love marvel but captain marvel as a character was rushed into the timeline and her feminist approach was basically shoved down our throats if she would have been introduced in years past it may have been different 255 
May 26 2019,positive,really enjoyable with a new take on captain marvel that i like better than any ive seen in the comics so far
May 26 2019,positive,stan lees movies never fail havent seen a marvel movie that i havent liked
May 26 2019,neutral,spoilers this movie isnt so good the plot isnt good the acting isnt so good besides samuel l jackson when the battle was about to come they gave it up for comedy didnt like the movie
May 26 2019,positive,as an mcu movie this may disappoint you as its lite on major superhero action but if you come in thinking of it more along the lines of a 90s movies then youll be in for a treat as it blends the superhero genre with buddy cop alien invasion and murder mystery for a surprisingly well balanced standalone popcorn flick
May 26 2019,positive,the end is the best part
May 26 2019,positive,great action movie good cast good plot line and fun to watch
May 26 2019,positive,such an amazing movie  so glad they brought her into mcu
May 26 2019,negative,first the cgi of samual l jackson is awesome  unfortunately that is the only good thing i can say about this flick absolutely no memorable fightsweak storyweak character development and bland visual style i feel this is a political stunt for another disney princess march line she comes in waaaayyy to late in the game of 10 yrs of marvel movies with character development of heroes weve come to love  bries characterperformance does not have the likability vulnerability or human emotions that we have identified with other virtually every other character in mcu movies and dont even get me started on her 3 minutes or so in end game  that movie would have been successful without this forced political stunt character 
May 26 2019,negative,disappointing not consistent with the character in the marvel universe
May 26 2019,positive,i dont usually love the back story movies this one was better than most i liked that it was set in the 90s and the soundtrack is a good time
May 26 2019,negative,i really wanted to like this film  i loved wonder woman and other earlier female superheros movies supergirl elektra and catwoman this movie was a missed opportunity  the lacklister leading lady and the forced sjw propaganda writing is the enemy here some of the lines are cringe worthy there is still a lot of of good from the supporting cast samuel jackson is entertaining as always and its just as much his orgin story as it is hers im not saying dont see it but it doesnt equal up to earlier marvel films i really think charlize theron or emily blunt would have been awesome as captain marvel a charismatic smile actually does go a long way lol ask captain america 
May 26 2019,negative,wow really bad and we have a low bar with superhero movies disjointed and messy odd
May 25 2019,positive,i wouldnt watch it again out of sheer enjoyment the dynamic between fury and danvers is one of the funnest any other mcu movie has to offer but the main protagonist on her own lacks the fire that makes audiences fall in love she doesnt feel exceptionally changed by anything or anyone and is only able to stand her own in character qualities when bouncing off of the charisma of everyone around her action scenes were worth it in look and one of the biggest payoffs final scene was simple and impactful still
May 25 2019,positive,great movie love the humor and the action
May 25 2019,positive,it was entertaining 
May 25 2019,positive,loved it should have come out before now  great add to the marvel movies
May 25 2019,positive,it did and delivered a slight lust of humour into it but the hype was half lived up for
May 25 2019,positive,loved so much about this movie happy my daughter  son can grow up admiring a superhero like captain marvel great addition to the mcu
May 25 2019,positive,good and adds context to certain scenes in endgame
May 25 2019,positive,endgame was good but largely predictable  captain marvel was well done fresh story line filled with cameos from other marvel movies and really does provide a foundation for rhw movies if the past 1012 years  highly recommended  now were can i adopt a flerken
May 25 2019,negative,bad actress even worse plot 
May 25 2019,negative,marvel please dont ruin everything u worked for 10 years  for this shit 
May 25 2019,positive,funny and witty and carries along a muchneeded message in todays culture
May 25 2019,negative,so horrible the worst marvels movie ever 
May 25 2019,negative,the main character was subpar
May 25 2019,negative,a forced movie that was seeking to appease too many different audiences i expect better enough said
May 25 2019,negative,really disappointed in this movie worst marvel movie ive seen since the incredible hulk brie larson showed no personality as captain marvel outside of a few flashback sequences and maybe the last 15 minutes of the movie i found more entertainment value with goose the cat and nick fury samuel l jackson overall forgettable movie highlights goose the cat nick fury nostalgia moments pay phones blockbuster due to the scene points program with galaxy cinemas i watched this free had i paid for this movie i would have left and asked for refund i would not recommend in the slightest
May 25 2019,negative,the movie was alright but if you wanted to watch it before endgame it is useless
May 25 2019,negative,i will be fair as i can i respect that its doing different things i respect what its trying to do the action scenes are fun and there is some creative ideas but the lead is not that interesting and the story is kind of soso i just wish there was more energy and fun behind this as it stands its ok but i wish there was more out there fun and less serious tone
May 25 2019,positive,i liked the movie captain marvel  the plot story and supporting characters were all great however i didnt like brie larson as captain marvel i wish they had made a better choice in leading ladies other than that it was a pretty solid movie 
May 25 2019,positive,its a decent mcu film its nothing great but nothing bad it has some good acting mostly from samuel l jackson and ben mendelson good visuals at times good action at times and some directors with potential but it does have some messy writing and annoying cliches
May 25 2019,neutral,bland and emotionless lead superhero takes so much away from this film
May 24 2019,negative,wooden acting by the lead flat character arc for the main protagonist does a disservice to narrative and back story for the mcu overall the only reason this movie was as successful at the box office was that it was the movie right before end game  sitts at the bottom of the list of mcu movies and we all know that marvel disney can do better 
May 24 2019,positive,i dont love this movie the movie needed more development and it didnt have any epic moments  good movie not great 
May 24 2019,positive,it was just alright
May 24 2019,negative,they can change their ratings system all they want but it wont change the fact that this movie was the worst decision by marvel in the 10 years of making great films
May 24 2019,neutral,captain marvel starts off as an interesting film i couple great action sequences then as the film goes on it gets work captain marvel is so powerful i feel no tension or any high stakes when the plot is playing out brie larson is a mediocre actress at best and captain marvel has to be one of the most boring heroes in the mcu not a bad movie but i cant say i recommend it either  
May 24 2019,negative,i hate this fake super hero  it fuckin silly
May 24 2019,positive,the marvel cinematic universe standards are deservingly high and this falls somewhere as average watchable with a couple satisfying scenes but im not going out of my way to see this movie again 
May 24 2019,positive,loved it was in the early 90s and the movie was just great
May 24 2019,positive,slow to get going but an excellent addition to the marvel universe 
May 24 2019,positive,absolutely nailed it had a great moment watching this movie and brie larsons performance is spot on loved that smug on her face and that confidence of hers combined to her superpowers was the perfect balance shes the hero ive been waiting for like since i was born not only because shes a female hero but because she embraces both her feminity and masculinity in the most delicious way total badass loved it 
May 24 2019,negative,brie larson gives a flat performance  there are some cool 90s callbacks and nick fury moments but the movie never hits its mark  one of the worst additions to the marvel universe
May 24 2019,positive,i think the movie was great there were amazingly choreographed action sequences great humor and overall a great story if youre looking for an overall blast watch this movie many people gave it bad ratings due to the fact that they cant handle a female lead but grow tf up
May 24 2019,negative,as a comic fan for over 20 years this movie stinks of todays feminist agenda i do not know who this actress is but she has no personality in the role except to feel like shes stronger than everyone maybe she isbut shes not the only hero  actually its hard to classify her as a hero why does she do what she does where does she get her motivations from last point the way she handled nick fury made me beside myself you win no fans with this movie shes too stuck up and full of herself  the character seems very insecure and shallow
May 24 2019,negative,captain marvel is the recipe for how to make an extremely bad movie with a terrible character and an actress who has nothing to add
May 24 2019,positive,a movies job is to entertain i was entertained give it a shot you may like it you may not make up your own mind
May 24 2019,negative,not a terrible movie but definitely below average and im surprised at the relatively high ratings its got shortchanged by pedestrian writing and very unconvincing acting from the title character she wasnt really there nothing seemed to actually be happening for her
May 24 2019,positive,captain marvel was decent its a midtier mcu movie politics aside i did enjoy the visual effects i didnt enjoy the movie depsite it actually being a decent product and addition to the mcu brie larson did a decent job but the movie felt dry and took itself too serious i would recommend mcu fans to check the movie out
May 24 2019,negative,boring bad acting lead actor fell flat and felt more like a political agenda than an adventure movie not fun at all 
May 24 2019,negative,im glad the movie after captain marvel was 10 times better for a first female lead marvel movie its an absolute joke boring start boring middle an obvious plot twist confusing ending and a boring lead her character is none existing whenever people talk about marvel movies are getting boring predictable faceless and cookie cutter theyre most likely talking about this film what made this movie worth a damn was nick fury and surprising the skrulls were good but they couldnt save this film if marvel ever attempts another female lead movie i hope its with respect for their audience and women 
May 24 2019,positive,yep  dat was a marvel movie alright
May 24 2019,negative,one of the most forgettable marvel movies ever just skip ahead to avengers end game where captain marvels limited scenes were somehow more entertaining than a movie all about her 
May 24 2019,positive,decent movie with a slow start thought it would be better as an mcu movie but wasnt all that great still better than thor 1 and 2 though
May 24 2019,negative,character without charisma could have come to the end of ultimatum to improve the charisma of the actress
May 24 2019,positive,brie larson was amazing and beautiful captain marvel was fantastic
May 24 2019,positive,probably one of my least favorite marvel movies but still a movie that passes the time there was some very good humor in the film and the production quality is great but that is not a surprise since this is a marvel movie larsons acting leaves some to be desired though
May 24 2019,positive,although the film developed the character eventually it seemed scattered i enjoyed the action in the end humour was appropriately placed
May 24 2019,negative,absolute waste of time 
May 24 2019,positive,this wasnt a bad marvel movie but wasnt exciting a lot of things felt rushed or forced samuel jackson saved this movie from being any worse id put it on the list of just another origin story that wasnt done justice 
May 24 2019,neutral,this is a completely average film i only recommend to people with nothing good to watch
May 24 2019,negative,the movie was not good 
May 24 2019,positive,just started getting into the mcu really enjoying the way they tie together this one was great too
May 24 2019,negative,the scenes seemed pressured and overactedyes even from sam j the characters really didnt connect with one another  they looked like they were crushed under the weight of carrying the mcu torch before handing it over to avengers end game  the cgi seemed brilliant enough but the acting and story telling fell really short  i enjoyed the movie as a weekend on the couch flick but not as a must see
May 24 2019,positive,amazing movie the acting was spot on can we please get more like this
May 24 2019,negative,human review that cat what was with that confirms suspicions disgusting not a fan youre gonna scare a lot of human patrons like that demon cats i did not come out of the sewers for thisi didnt come out at all i was born on the surface world not a fan 
May 24 2019,negative,there is no real conflict and no character development its an ok movie storywise but it does not live up to the expectations i have for a marvel movie
May 24 2019,negative,putrid performance by larson
May 24 2019,positive,i loved everything about it love the fact that it was set in the 90s since i grew up in the 90s it was awesome and nostalgic at the same time
May 24 2019,negative,worst of the marvel movies watched it thinking it would have more of a tie in with endgame id compare this to solo movie i personally liked the cat scenes the best
May 23 2019,positive,i dont like the cgi samuel jackson trying to make him look younger but everything else about the film was great although i couldnt tell if brie larson is a bad actress or if thats the way she was trying to play the character had to watch something else with her in it to know she was doing some great acting but again all i had to compare to was scott pilgrim vs the world 
May 23 2019,negative,one of the worst movies in mcu highlights include interactions between the titular character and nick fury  probably the best parts of the movie writing lacks cohesiveness and thought could be much better just by changing the editing
May 23 2019,negative,very overrated larsons acting fell flat
May 23 2019,negative,it had a lot of potential for greatness and i was very excited to hear about it after infinity war but the oneliners were terrible the final battle scene was not exciting nor creative and they put political views and feminist idiologies over the fans big oof i refret spending money to go and see this
May 23 2019,negative,movie was not good didnt even tie into the mcu at all they tried too hard most of the time the main actress had no emotion through out the film and her acting felt bland and forced 
May 23 2019,negative,its was just aight captain marvel she was so robotic with emotion the hype is just hype 
May 23 2019,negative,low score partially based on the comparison to what marvel has done in the past and the expectations that they have created  ultimately i gave this a 2 not because of any of the outside noise as annoying as it was but because there was no real tension  yes i know that in most of these movies the good guygirl will win but i have to have some belief that they are overcoming odds to do it  captain marvel was never in any danger of losing to the villains in this and that just made things a little boring
May 23 2019,negative,bland boring larson isnt likable as a character or as an overpowered hero the plot is weak and uninteresting 
May 23 2019,positive,great movie good plot lots of action twists and turns great actors and acting loved it
May 23 2019,positive,having gone in with expectations was surprised by the fun and humor present within the story thought the characters were great and the timeera reminders were reasonably placed would recommend by no means a piece of art it is still a comic book movie  probably best enjoyed if youve kept your head clear of all the controversy and internet clamor surrounding the promotion of this movie  
May 23 2019,negative,the rating goes from a 2star to a 4star depending on if you are previously a ms marvel fan   there are many takeaways from this movie so ill try to sum them up  the mcu had always been brilliant at making their movies accessible to everyone old fans and young fans long time comic fans and brand new fans that only know this movie universe this is the first time they very obviously aimed the movie only at new fans and completely ignored long time fans so if you know nothing about carol danvers the skrulls marvell monica rambeau or various other things from marvel comics this is actually a pretty good movie what they changed is pretty infuriating but if you dont know what they changed than the takeaway of the movie is pretty decent some solid action political cringe level is minimal and the biggest strength of the movie there is a persistent subtle humor that keeps everything interesting if youre a long time fan the long and short of it is 1 prepare to nerd rage and 2 this movie and this character will not remotely live up to the carol danvers ms marvel you are probably be familiar with itll just leave you a hunger for them to make a good ms marvel movie instead of a semicrappy 2012 captain marvel rendition of carol danvers   as for the political cringe factor many were worried about thankfully its minimal its there but minimal a few scenes that clearly confuse being a badass female character with just preaching woo grrl powah some gender swapped characters for no reason other than well we cant have her looking up to a male character and honestly the only one that matters a big twist in the movie that altered something important for the sake of shoehorning in a political message wont go into it here as itd be spoilers   so to resum up if youve never read the comics if you dont know how badass ms marvel is this is a 4star movie its good and enjoyable if you know anything about the comics its 2star itll nerd rage you it wont live up to the character you have in your mind and it will on occasion insult you
May 23 2019,negative,it was a marvel movie but it really wasnt one of the better ones
May 23 2019,neutral,not the best marvel film brie larson was great and she will be a fantastic addition to the mcu and sam jackson is perfect as always the story is very lacking but the fault of this movie is editing and the directors its a serviceable film that wont ruin your day
May 23 2019,negative,the writing was horrid and had 00001 character development a lot of the events made absolutely no sense and is a slap in the face to nick fury and shield  as a whole 
May 23 2019,positive,good movie but lacked a little in the story and action goose made this movie worth watching again 
May 23 2019,negative,yikes they should have focused way more on character development instead virtue signalling 
May 23 2019,positive,it was a very good adaptation the movie is very well balanced 
May 23 2019,positive,the audience score is bs antiwoman hackers are trying to downgrade this movie when it is actually a classic marvel film rotten tomatoes needs to address this problem
May 23 2019,negative,the writers limited themselves over societal concerns instead of writing a good movie  could have been great turned out to bejust ok
May 23 2019,negative,not up to the same caliber as the other mcu movies  disappointing
May 23 2019,positive,this was an awesome movie a superhero that i can personally connect to for once  
May 23 2019,positive,the pacing particularly the first half can be a bit convoluted and jerky but the second half is better theres less action than youd expect but still has all the comedic relief youve come to adore especially with samuel l jackson taking on a bigger role in this film than usual for the mcu while i think far too many complaints are just people far too hurt that a female lead superhero is finally around and as cool and powerful as captain marvel is there is some legitimate criticism for brie larsons somewhat bland deadpan delivery for the majority of the movie overall though for the mcu this is a very standardfare entry
May 23 2019,negative,confusing start boring finish
May 23 2019,positive,a great addition to the mcu with great effects characters and laughs
May 23 2019,positive,it was great but marvel knows more than this movie
May 23 2019,negative,exposition tactic trite mary sue overpowered unsympathetic protagonist a real disappointment
May 23 2019,positive,really entertaining movie with interesting and creative plot
May 23 2019,positive,much lighter take in this film than the usual marvel super hero fare lovely to see fury as a younger more humorous character and brie larson showing how the captain will be once she was given the script
May 23 2019,positive,another great marvel film its so nice to see a strong female protagonist there were a two emotional moments that fell a little flat for my taste overall it was a very fun experience i cant wait for the sequel
May 22 2019,negative,i do not see how any of this could have been left out of the mcu to date only for them to shoehorn it in now i feel that this required too much effort brie larsons character also does not arouse any sympathy it all just seems dry and forced
May 22 2019,negative,very disappointing captain marvel was supposed to inspire women as the first female character in the mcu to get a solo film but that is not what happened the movie about as safe boring predictable and bland as mcu movies get the editing and writing are both bad the special effects while not as terrible as black panthers final fight scene is bad compared to all the other mcu movies before it bri larson does not fit the role her acting range is that of a stick the entire point of the movie is to establish carol as a character but they give her no personality i nor no one i know can name a single personality trait she has every mcu movie ive seen the theater is always filled with laughter or a reaction at all from the audience but in this one the audience was dead silent the entire time the theater was packed and i did not nor did anyone else laugh once they failed to fix her character problem in endgame where she is one of the worst things about the movie but i hope they can fix it in future films or maybe even replace bri larson with an actor who actually has skill i wanted to like carol and her solo film but i came out of the theater hating the character and the movie
May 22 2019,negative,the movie was not very good as brie larsson was the worst pick for the role and the best part was the cat
May 22 2019,positive,the movie is a little too long and not as good as wonder woman but still a really inspirational movie
May 22 2019,negative,the protagonist is overpowered and not particularly likable the movies only redeeming quality is samuel l jackson and the exploration of nick furys character the plot twist near the end of the movies is good though insufficiently foreshadowed unfortunately a movie tends to succeed or fail with its protagonist i hope marvel didnt have too many plans for captain marvel because i wont be paying to see a sequel
May 22 2019,negative,the storyline was pure garbage
May 21 2019,negative,shite okay i normally love heroes like this the problem is she had no trials all stories have ups and downs im a musician and writing songs come with the chorus a change i dont know if it was the actor or how it was written just a bad song a lack of harmony i dont know what they were thinking watch it and make your own judgements sad really
May 21 2019,negative,one or two good parts but would totally skip it and watch the rest of the marvel movies
May 21 2019,negative,just so im clear not voting this way for politics just really didnt like the movie
May 21 2019,positive,a great movie with a great cast and a lead actress that is severley over hated brie larson is a beautiful woman and her part as carol danvers is great the only problem i have is the way nick fury lost his eye thats the only reason its only 4 and a half stars
May 21 2019,positive,great movie brie larson as always presenting us with his great performance
May 21 2019,negative,my optimism for another exciting humorous and entertaining mcu movie was quickly downsized i cannot determine if the casting or direction is to blame the main character is lacking in charisma and the script gives me no reason to pull for her when she finally overcomes her obstacles the power to do so is unearned lets hope there is not a sequel
May 21 2019,negative,brie larson was incredible in short term 12 but what happened to her this lacks so much character
May 21 2019,negative,trying to hard to be pc
May 21 2019,negative,lead actress should be substituted otherwise its a good movie
May 20 2019,neutral,the ending fight scene kinda sucked she is way to op
May 20 2019,neutral,does not live up to the standards set by other mcu movies 
May 20 2019,negative,had the chance to be great they put in one of the best villians and storiesthen ruin it with everything else couldve been greatbut go figure they ruined it
May 20 2019,negative,the movie was extremely bland and lacked any main conflict it felt like they were just trying to cram in everything that they had not mentioned yet before endgame and even with the absurd amount of things added the movie was still extremely boring and i nearly fell asleep during it
May 20 2019,negative,too politicized not enough personality and uninteresting main character
May 20 2019,negative,she is a terrible actress how she won any award i will never knowabout as emotional about what is going on around her as the chick from twilightplank stump or whatever you want to compare her too would be an insultto whatever you are comparing her to not impressed at all and i was looking forward to this movie
May 20 2019,positive,love it im in love with this movie
May 20 2019,negative,didnt like it at all seemed a bit forced like the actors were trying to hard
May 20 2019,positive,a slow marvel film but good nonetheless
May 20 2019,positive,one movie very funni it s fantestici have many fightsseveral alens and cenas that appear dramatic but are greased  i foudi a movie fantestic and i recommend to all
May 20 2019,neutral,movie was easily one of the worst mcu movies of all time best character was the cat
May 19 2019,negative,could be a lot better maybe meg ryan could be a better captain marvel
May 19 2019,positive,i loved it  ive been waiting years for this movie
May 19 2019,negative, bland too much political overtone please keep politics out of entertainment please most of us regular sane folk dont want that poison 
May 19 2019,positive,another great addition to the mcu
May 19 2019,positive,not as bad as the trailers made it seem thats about it though its just okay
May 19 2019,negative,sucked so bad literally puke worthy loved captain marvel comics but should have cast someone that can act brie larson killed this character she has the depth of a street puddle
May 19 2019,negative,this movie gets one star from me simply because fury and coulson were in it  this movie was poorly written and poorly acted by the lead  i was very disappointed in the character build up of carol danvers  so many plot holes  this carol danvers character would have been better of being ms marvel  this was a marvel movie that i saw once and then had no desire to ever see again  seriously  once was enough  i saw deapool in the theater 6 times  i saw infinity war in the theater 4 times  craptain marvel  1 and done  mcus biggest turd so far
May 19 2019,negative,overhyped and not that entertaining 
May 19 2019,negative,brie larson as captain marvel is just disgusting weak cinema with a weak plot and absolutely zero significance in the marvel cinema universe nobody needed not funny and not interesting film which should not waste your time
May 19 2019,negative,never felt like captain marvel was in any particular danger her character lacked depth and personality i never felt invested in her character id compare her to female character such as wonder woman a movie i love but considering the attitude surrounding this movie and the message the movie was trying to get across ill compare her to a man iron man is the greatest character in the mcu im biased but isure many would agree because he is imperfect intelligent and complex not because hes powerful power doesnt mean intersting and being a strong character doesnt impress the viewer unless theyre invested in the character
May 19 2019,positive,great movie  kept my attention throughout and had great action 
May 19 2019,negative,i liked the story but shes ruining the franchise ï 12ï 12âï 12tmï 12â
May 19 2019,positive,this movie was okay i wouldnt see it again but it is essential to the career of nick fury and shows the kree civilization developing making it essential to see for guardians of the galaxy also captain marvel is a big character in avengersendgame
May 19 2019,positive,loved it captainmarvel was so good and its tells us more about nick furys past and explains many things from our movies that happened already like guardians of the galaxy
May 19 2019,negative,ok so remember when at the beginning of the first thor movie when he was an arrogant hot headed dis likable ass hole and the movies plot agreed with this and basically it was all about correcting his character flaws ok well captain marvel danvers is basically an even worse version of that but apparently because she is a girl that is ok even though it is all the exact same character flaws if you were looking for a marvel movie with a political and cultural agenda more than script here is the one you are searching for
May 18 2019,positive,exellent movie   people criticised captain marvel for her voice against racism and ill mentality of man against women so that movie was on threat  but it became successful and why notit is a exellent movie to say  it was full of commedyactionthrilladventure   good one
May 18 2019,negative,it was terrible her acting was just awful im ready for rogue to step in the picture and put carol into a coma ugh its just terrible
May 18 2019,negative,boring storyline and shoves politics into it when its supposed to be a fun action superhero movie
May 18 2019,negative,i was honestly excited about the captain marvel movie despite all of the negative publicity i wish they had gone with one of several preexisting female characters for the first female led marvel movie but that was my only minor gripe going into the movie  once i actually watched it i was pretty disappointed i thought maybe it was a marvel movie that needed a second viewing to grow on me so i saw it again it was even more of a let down the second time around  from a plot that really doesnt make sense once you think about it to brie larsons mostly wooden acting the movie was just not all that great seriously watch any scene where ms larson is acting across from a better actor its painfully obvious that theyre carrying the scene
May 18 2019,positive,as a young girl this movie was monumental it makes me so happy to see a female superhero starring in her own movie i loved it brie larson did an amazing job and i would love to see more of carol danvers in the future
May 18 2019,negative,rushed movie what was she fighting for 
May 18 2019,negative,well this was utterly boring also lmao on how many reviews were deleted
May 18 2019,negative,really boring and not great acting from lead actress
May 18 2019,negative,a gigantic worsethanmeh spearheaded by the lackluster and uncharismatic lead actress  ms larson was horribly miscast  she is thoroughly unlikeable and unbelievable in the role of a superhero     nick furys character bears zero resemblance to the nick fury we know from a few years later in movie chronology  his eye injury was poorly conceived and portrayed     a certain factions comic book canon is ignored seemingly to make a current political point thereby removing the possibility  in future marvel films  they could be used as the excellent villains they are     a retired pilot  coming along for essentially no  good reason  maneuvers a makeshift cobbledtogether spacecraft with such aplomb that shes able to destroy a highly advanced alien spacecraft    i didnt care one iota about any of the characters because they were never placed in believable danger     this might be the absolute worst mcu movie  scratch that it is
May 18 2019,negative,this is probably the worst marvel movie apart from the incredible hulk the worst thing about this movie is the script and the screenplay captain marvel does not go through the heros journey and at no point was she ever vulnerable hence the time she fully gained her power was not impactful at all furthermore brie larson is a complete miscast as the superhero she has zero charisma as captain marvel something which all marvel heroes have her silver tongue attitude comes off as an unlikable version of a potty mouth tony stark which is worse this film cannot hold a candle to wonder woman
May 18 2019,negative,just horrible the movie absolutely fails to make you care about the characters considering that nothing really matters 
May 18 2019,negative,this had cg worse than black panther rushed incoherent story telling forgettable villains bad acting lame jokes and too many plot holes
May 18 2019,negative,everything was a contrived mess captain marvel had virtuallh no charachter development nothing made logical sense as far as film direction goes just go watch maulers video on youtube
May 17 2019,positive,ive seen better but ive seen worse too it wasnt infinity war or even endgame quality but at leadt it was better than black panthet
May 17 2019,negative,marvel studioss winning streak comes to a halt with captain marvel in one of the most boring interpretations of the most interesting comic book characters in marvels arsenal i dont doubt brie larsons acting but her interpretation of the character definitely needs work
May 17 2019,positive,another great marvel movie that integrates well into the mcu and ties into avengers endgame 
May 17 2019,positive,the aweinspiring acting by brie laron as captain marvel as well as the great portrayal of a young nick fury by samuel jackson set this movie over the edge will always be one of the best marvel movies or superhero movies in general in my opinion
May 17 2019,positive,exciting wellmade film  wellacted and full of thrills
May 17 2019,negative,pretty bad saw it for the endgame connection but pretty much just left with a weird reason for furys eye if marvel wanted their version of superman they could have at least come up with a more interesting plot there just wasnt any character development or convincing acting i get that with hollywoodsmarvels politics theyd want a strong female lead but they butchered the movie i also wouldve rather saw them use one of the established female characters that have had plenty of character development and draw real emotional reactions from the audience since they overpowered a character from the comics give powers to black widow or give scarlet witch her own movie    all that being said the movie had cool visuals and some really funny moments i just couldnt get into it because the character was overly cocky and was better and smarter at everything than everyone not sure where marvel plans to go from there in the next phase    just for the record  i think id like the character even less if it was a man the fact that marvel introduced such an overpowered character at the last second and took away from characters that have been developing for over a decade is amazing to me yes set up the next phase but damn finish what got you here first  completely ditched the hulkwidow thingand really hulk all together and played into some weird emotional stereotype with thor getting fat in 5 years eventho thats about a week for normal humans i get the depression thing but no one wants to see that or cap being clearly portrayed as more powerful than thor with the hammer anyway ive gone off on a tangent point is  marvel should have started slower with captain marvel and i would have bought into it but they dialed everything to 11 in the first act and i just cant get behind it
May 17 2019,negative,acting underwelming story loose and forced forcing politics down viewers throats special effects mediocre at best
May 17 2019,positive,not fitting humor aside  not a story that has much space for  the marvel humor we are accustomed to expect i loved the relentless of the  dont  matter how hard you try to strike me down or mess with my mind  ill se through and be back up 100 times  stronger  every  time i dont have time or patience for nonsense im a soldier   type  of character the friendship love was a much needed breath of fresh air 
May 17 2019,neutral,i feel like it didnt know what kind of movie it wanted to be the tone varies from scene to scene its just okay kind of disappointing
May 17 2019,negative,worst marvel movie after the fantastic 4 onesperiod
May 17 2019,positive,captain marvel was the first female led marvel film we needed
May 17 2019,neutral,looks cool very feminists vibe shes trying too hard to be a superhero instead of being a humble character 
May 17 2019,positive,mediocre at best emotionless and cold performance from brie larson the story was good and there were moments where i laughed and enjoyed the movie but the parts where they brought political ideas and themes into the movie kinda ruined it for me because it became too serious the point of a movie especially a marvel one is to escape from reality for a moment to forget about the world around us and just emerge ourself in the fantasy world that is shown in front of us but captain marvel tried too hard to make political statements which ruined the magic of a marvel movie for me
May 17 2019,negative,the acting was extremely lackluster they ruined the movie by making captain marvel extremely overpowered it take away all of the grit of the other movies the humor was ok but not on the level of most marvel films seeing the character vulnerable has been what made every marvel movie so good they clearly just wanted to push an overpowered person onto the team to deal with thanos
May 17 2019,negative,nothing there technically well made movie but the story was one dimensional made like they had a list to check off but neglected to include a sympathetic main character people could identify with  lazy writing
May 17 2019,positive,what can i say its movie not a very memorable movie i would say
May 17 2019,positive,real dc vibes from this the movie isnt bad its amazing because it has goose in it
May 17 2019,negative,boring paint by numbers film it felt like a cash grab
May 16 2019,negative,had it come out earlier it wouldnt feel so stale at this point its another copy and paste identikit marvel film 
May 16 2019,negative,wrong choice of actress
May 16 2019,positive,solid mcu addition but lacked support from existing mcu heroes will be buying for the mcu arc on bluray for sure 
May 16 2019,negative,poor story telling they introduce captain marvel almost at the end of phase 3 for nothing because she didnt have much of a role in endgame
May 16 2019,negative,dont watch it its very bad and useless
May 16 2019,positive,not a bad movie by any means but the marvel formula is very apparent and the humor relies too heavily on 90s nostalgia
May 16 2019,positive,very much enjoyed brie larson and samuel l jacksons friendship throughout the film great soundtrack great show of female friendship cant wait to see more of her we were robbed in endgame
May 16 2019,negative,the entire movie was very cliche the characters especially the titular character were very underdeveloped except for the idea that she wants to beat the men that put her down it was bad enough that even made me uncomfortable as a woman the score was unremarkable and the popular songs chosen did not fit the scenes they were in completely taking me out of the movie too many things that are serious and have a history in the mcu were played as a joke that didnt really land because of the acting the fact that her powers were completely controlled as soon as she embraced them was contrary to every superhero journey weve seen so far the feminist rhetoric obviously took prescient over the development of character and story entirely she is too flawless to be relatable all in all this movie is a miss for me 
May 16 2019,positive,had a great story learned new information about shields origin we liked it as much as wonder woman hoping there will be a sequel im going back to the theater to see it again
May 16 2019,negative,some moments were crazy bland some moments were confusing to say the least and the only good aspect was crazy cgi that ive seen a thousand times before not even worth watching on netflix definitely a pass
May 16 2019,positive,very empowering movie did a great job at giving a back story to captain marvel and kept the audience interested
May 16 2019,positive,this movie was one of my personal favorite mcu films it was certainly amazing
May 16 2019,positive,there were several enjoyable parts to the movie as a standalone but not enough to make it something i would strongly recommend they pretty much run an inferior steve rogers arc over 3 movies crammed into one this lack of carols character development her drive and resolve was put front and center the over the top girl power scenes everyone is clamoring about shrug it off and relax as it didnt make or break the movie    this movie would have been better suited for one of marvels tv offerings it does contain the greatest stan lee cameo of all marvel films    however within the mcu it felt rushed in order to be shoehorned in time for endgame and ultimately ends up on the bottom tier of the three phase 22 film marvel cinematic universe overall it wasnt a waste of time it was neither terrible nor fantastic it was
May 16 2019,negative,not the best of the marvel films but nice to see a bit of nick furrys past
May 16 2019,positive,great film brie larson was the perfect cast for this super hero hope there are more movies to come in this series
May 16 2019,negative,its easily one of the worst mcu movies so far its not even worth my time to write a whole review but at least i wanted to warn you do not spend money on this movie wait to watch it for free on some streaming service
May 16 2019,negative,it was a okay movie but definitely not in my top 10 of the mcu
May 16 2019,negative,i say its a half star because it was way too rushed and the directors said that you need to see captain marvel to understand endgame then give her not even 5 minutes of screen
May 16 2019,negative,storys not bad just chose the wrong actress shes terrible first big miss in casting for marvel 
May 16 2019,negative,horrible movie im a 33 year old latino
May 16 2019,negative,worst mcu movie yet even worst then thor the dark world
May 15 2019,negative,as popular as this movie is i found a lot of the ideas old and already done marvel needs something new if you arent tired of the classic marvel formula see it if not pass
May 15 2019,negative,ill keep this short bris acting was very underwhelming giving flat monotoned monologs  cgi effects where very clunky and very subpar with usual marvel movie graphics overall this movie is not worth your time unless you are just trying to watch all of the marvel movies    megan
May 15 2019,positive,a solid origin story that kept me engaged and i like what they did with the skrulls nothing mindblowing or groundbreaking but fun nonetheless
May 15 2019,negative,plot was pretty good soundtrack was great hated that they ruined nick furys backstory and it was inconsistent to what were led to believe about his background in winter soldier fury is pretty much useless the entire movie which is completely not fitting captain marvel as a character who by the way i do like in the comics for the most part was poorly represented in this movie we did not get a grasp of who this hero actually is what are her values what even is her personality this movie consistently screamed girlpower as women are the only ones who actually do anything useful in the movie black panther did a good job being balanced and not poorly representing any group this movie was completely unbalanced in that regard
May 15 2019,positive,despite the directors and the plot brie larson was born to be carol danvers
May 15 2019,negative,worst marvel movie they shouldve dropped production you can tell they made this just for avengers endgame poor movie experience
May 15 2019,positive,just a thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining marvel movie
May 15 2019,negative,i came into this movie not really knowing what to expect but knowing it had a lot of hype and criticism going both ways the movie was very meh for me honestly i like a lot of aspects of the character but it just seemed like it was trying to hard to be a female empowerment movie instead of just a good movie very slow paced and the action sequences when they did arrive didnt seem like they were very thought out whats the point of a superhero who has no weaknesses wheres the challenge i like the idea of captain marvel a lot more than i like captain marvel
May 15 2019,negative,meh the film like many films these days try to use visual beauty to hide a bad story which is not only inconsistent within the film itself to an unforgivable degree but is also inconsistent to the entire mcu so badly it retcons certain part of the mcu  you can enjoy the film so long as you switch your brain off and only pay attention to the surface level story and the beautiful visual
May 15 2019,negative,i tried to watch it 3 times but never finished it completely i thought the character development was bad and i thought she was annoying they should have gone with adam warlock instead
May 15 2019,negative,dident live up to the hype no good villian still blank about who she is
May 15 2019,negative,brie larsons stupid comments aside this movie is just boring no good action sequences no really funny scenes and just  a  slightly annoying character and muddled pacing make this film arguably one of the worst entries  into the mcu
May 15 2019,positive,i wanted to love this movie i really did but the protagonist of this movie is so bland and boring with no character arc at all and a antagonist that was so bland it made me wanna die the story itself has moments of good writing and some of the action is cool but this is a very underwhelming film
May 15 2019,positive,a really great film that shows women can and are capable of doing anything very inspiring for young girls
May 15 2019,negative,best things about it were samuel l jackson stan lee and the cat
May 15 2019,neutral,from past experience of what i have come to expect from a marvel movie especially origins movies this falls flat to me where i left the theaters feeling empty cinematically it was beautiful but the storyline was not compelling
May 15 2019,neutral,lack of consistency as well as the lack of character development deliberately made captain marvel an uninteresting and flat movie
May 15 2019,negative,campbells heros journey is nowhere to be seen every character in the movie is bland beyond the first act which is halfway interesting this features boring generic and 80s like naive writing it feels forced into the mcu and in case you are wondering no you dont need to watch this to understand avengers endgame skip this one guys
May 15 2019,neutral,it is a marvel movie   1 star out the gate    i was entertained but would not see again for theater prices  the entertainment value just isnt there  captain marvel had no struggle no loss no growth and no reason to become a hero except that well the kree told her she was a noble warrior hero    there was nothing that spoke to who danvers is as a person beyond the superficial and that she has abilities i felt nothing for this character i was just never moved  i wish i could have been i felt more for the kree struggle    samuel jackson would have made this a 35 star review but that was not the nick fury we all know and love he and the cat where comic relief and entertaining i that aspect  but its sam jackson  so 15 stars there
May 15 2019,negative,bad chose of an actor for the lead
May 15 2019,negative,the best worst movie in the history of worst movies captain marvel ruins the amazing mcu by throwing in the face of an audience a product not a character  a rude and stoic plastic person with no growth sense motivation or emotion that beautifully renders all the other better movies meaningless wirh its skilfully scripted plot that defies logic in every possible way ï 12
May 15 2019,positive,one of the most wronged movies of the mcu i really liked it and definetly dont deserve the hate
May 15 2019,negative,honestly brie larson is not right for this role 
May 15 2019,negative,absolutely horrible such a flop wish i had asked for my  back
May 15 2019,negative,what a waste of time for a movie no character development no charisma i never felt connected with her journey because she had no journey just a waste of time plus freaking nick fury lost his damn eye because of a cat this is the worse movie the mcu has ever done lets hope it stays as the first and last captain marvel movie
May 15 2019,negative,sadly this movie only has marvels 10 year legacy to thank for its merits at the box office as an origin story it falls quite short of mcu standards lets compare it to the first one iron man 2008 tony stark begins as a selfish ignorant and drunk play boy after a life threatening event he is awoken to reality and the consequences of his ignorance who then proceeds to change everything about his life to be a better person and the movie finishes with him willing to sacrifice his life to stop the bad guy in comparison carol danvers starts of as an impulsive soldier with very little self control and a very egotistical presence she struggles to find her memories and finds out shes living a lie but the story ends with her quite simply gaining even more power and even less restraint to   summarize she is the same egotistical impulsive person as in   the beginning unfortunately it seems the writers have focused on the wrong politics in this movie a character who possess this magnitude of power shouldnt be unleashing it every chance they get especially in an origin story on a side note if you want to see a movie with female empowerment done the right way watch akita battle angel or wonder woman
May 15 2019,negative,unfortunately crapton marvel is exactly what youll expect a ton of crap  
May 15 2019,positive,captain marvel looks like a phase one movie its cool but not at the level of current mcu productions
May 15 2019,positive,captain marvel is not the feminist franchisekiller some feared it would be however it is hardly the empowering masterpiece some expected either in reality this feels like a phase one movie more than anything with a worrying reliance on the playedout stock origin story formula whilst we twist involving the skulls does work the retcons of nick fury and the tesseract end up as either convoluted or plain annoying samuel l jackson and ben mendhelson are excellent as ever but brie larson is rather wooden and unlikeable with her character flaws having no consequences or impact on the plot making her feel like a sulky petulant teenager who hasnt been disciplined properly the cgi is also an incredibly mixed ranging from realistic to ps4 cutscene however there are some redeeming qualities there are some good laughs and action even though the final fight irritatingly looks like it was filmed by a gopro attached to a frantic squirrel stop using unnecessary shakycam hollywood the skulls look fantastic and there are some good points about refugees and trust however the movie just feels average when compared to the more creative and recent marvel movies and stalls as much as it soars with endgame coming up this film just feels like the prelude it is hinting at the glory to come but not sharing it   on the surface its an entertaining movie that wastes two hours of your free time in an enjoyable manner however marvel needs to try far harder if they are going   to introduce more heroes captain marvel is a movie that is just there not the groundbreaker that was wonder woman but hardly the dismal origin story that some feared
May 15 2019,negative,it was quite disappointing i had expected more from the lead actor
May 15 2019,negative,retroactively destroyed the marvel universe 
May 14 2019,positive,captain marvel is a perfectly acceptable origin film thats held down only buy its standard scenes of action and severe lack of personality
May 14 2019,neutral,sometimes this film like to watch
May 14 2019,positive,awesome finally a woman who kicks a
May 14 2019,negative,wasnt funny action had no tension action wasnt that good story made no sense if you thought about it for more than 2 seconds horrible continuity messed up characters that were previously good and introduces captain marvel that has horrible acting and can do everything with no character or character development
May 14 2019,negative,where to begin  the reason of the ordinary human becoming a superhero is totally idiotic a total nonsense the one sided bullit also makes me vomit except some funny scenes
May 14 2019,negative,i went into the theater hoping to enjoy this movie hoping it could sate my desire for endgame i left thoroughly disappointed and shocked that marvel would release a movie like this captain marvel was unfunny had little action and seemed as if it was just slapped together for the sake of making another movie
May 14 2019,positive,awesome we need more girl action n heros 
May 13 2019,positive,captain marvel was not a hero i knew was good to get the back story and looks like it leads into endgame
May 13 2019,negative,expected better than this garbage undermines nick fury coolness to get his eyes scratched by a cat plus the cat is so smart why would he scratch him anyways bries acting is atrocious is it intentional how did this make a 1 billion did disney buy the ticket themselves need to recast brie if you wanna watch female led superhero just go watch wonder woman
May 13 2019,negative,this would be on the lower end of the mcu spectrum kind of bland personality and some odd choices for her take on cap marvel i think a more personal touch could have saved this movie for me
May 13 2019,negative,cpt marvel is a one trick pony there is nothing to her character journey the portray her as a victim someone that doesnt have any weaknesses faults or has made any mistakes that they feel they need to atone for she is fairly boring   they have made her so overpowered that it makes putting her up against any enemy pointless its like playing a video game with all the cheat codes you cant die never run out of bullets and can eliminate your enemies with a single punch sure that is fun for like 5 min but then it just gets boringï
May 13 2019,negative,it wasnt that great like other marvel movies
May 13 2019,positive,i liked this movie however it didnt do much to wow me lacked something
May 13 2019,positive,just finished my second viewing of captain marvel no i havent seen endgame yet so dont even think about posting anything about that movie here    i also will not be posting any spoilers on captain marvel just a few observations    1 like the antman movies i was pleasantly surprised by how much i enjoyed this edition of the marvel cinematic universe it was a lot of fun    2 it is a well crafted tale good chemistry between the characters a great build up of action throughout the film leading to an ending that is as to be expected of this character a tremendously cosmically awesome climax     3 speaking of characters there are a lot of very touching moments between captain marvel and various supporting cast members none will be mentioned her no spoilers just an awareness that the films content is more that just cosmic fistacuffs     4 for those in the know where there is a captain marvel there is going to be alien kree and where there is kree there is also going to be their arch enemies the skrulls there are some nice touching moments with them as well that run the emotional gamut from tender to sinister     5 while viewing one of the touching moment from item 3 above i had my mind wandering off to the sad reality of our cultural deficiencies despite the allinclusive narrative of our constitution and our declaration of independence we suppress many of our citizens from contributing to our total common welfare be they female persons of color sexual orientations the end process of our hateful discrimination deprives us of so much potential greatness that it shrinks our true strengths to a tiny fraction of what they could be otherwise and yes indeed i know it is this narrative running throughout the film that drives the fear mongering racists out there to launch drives to suppress this film before they even take the time to view it     6 those cosmic endbits of the good captain soaring in space triggered many fine childhood memories of a wide breadth of gene colan and jim starlin captain marvel comics john buscema silver surfer comics and perhaps most surprisingly steve ditkos work on charlton comics captain atom yea not a marvel character at all     7 a special delight was watching annette bennings performance along with all the other fine acting by this cast it was a sweet bonus treat    8 as if you couldnt tell i really enjoyed this movie i mean i really really enjoyed it
May 13 2019,negative,great comic character but portrayed with a bad actor the movie sucked honestly this movie dissipointed me in a lot of ways
May 13 2019,positive,thank you brie larson once again being an wonderful actress
May 13 2019,negative,it just isnt my type of movie
May 13 2019,positive,captain marvel is arguable the least interesting part of captain marvel the only thing you need to know about the character is that she is all powerful and that she exists when a cat is the most entertaining aspect of the film there are fundamental issues with the script    brie larsons performance is bland it makes sense at the end of the film so i understand the creative decision behind it however it doesnt play very well on screen it felt like they focused so much on making her a strong female that they forgot to make her human young nick fury is hilarious so that was fun lashana lynch and akira akbar steal the show in every scene they deliver the most organic performances of the film and i would love to see them in more films     its still a much better film than most films out there however at this point the bar in the mcu films is so high that it did not live up to expectations id say its slightly better than the first two thor movies which is disappointing for a phase 3 film
May 13 2019,negative,the action scenes were good and so were the effects but the movie was way too predictable i had 5 theories walking into the movie and all of them were right
May 13 2019,negative,weak storytelling and lack of awareness of the fact that it is a prequel is only underplayed by the lackluster acting it is just a thinlyveiled social justice warrior movie it is not even funnybad like a steven seagal movie
May 13 2019,positive,a perfect introduction to captain marvel in the mcu
May 13 2019,negative,very boring and nothing like the excitement of the previous marvel movies and seems to have no bearing on the end game movie
May 13 2019,negative,movie seems to be made while trying hard some moments were boring and clearly made for some very loud society groups which would not be bad if they werent so sketchy and noneyerollcausing captain marvel was supposed to be the strongest character in mcu yet here comes the zeroemotionface lady to become the ultimate queen of marvel movie servies quite unsuccesfully this happens when instead of following what people like  producers focus on what the loudest people want which is quite frequently the opossite what people want  skipping the movie would not hurt maybe even help a bit if not for captain appearing in the endgame with the sketchy one scene
May 13 2019,neutral,while this is a decent introduction for captain marvel some of the plot lines fall short and brie larson really isnt the best fit for the character yes the role is fulfilled decently but this is definitely not a film that sticks out in the mcu
May 13 2019,negative,one of the worst movie i have ever watched in my life and worst mcu movie
May 13 2019,negative,the movie fills more like a filler actually dont really need to actual watch this to understand end game actually
May 13 2019,positive,i dont understand the user score here this movie is awesome
May 12 2019,negative,eh it wasnt as good as it was hyped up to be i felt like i didnt grow and learn about this character 
May 12 2019,negative,not really good i was expecting to be goodbut disappointed after seeing it the actress could have better but very disappointed in her acting and the story line was a bit confusing wonder women was 100 better  i guess its the actor and not character of the movie that made the movie not worth seeing again or adviser friends to see the movie i wouldnt buy the dvd like u did with wonder women  ï 12
May 12 2019,positive,a fun 90s romp though not as strong as some parts of the mcu it has one of the more memorable fight scenes to me fantastic comic book references as well as fun characters especially the ones we know already from other movies
May 12 2019,negative,the movie really did not connect with me at all she is meant to be a hero but gets offended at smile and steals a guys bike yes your hurt feelings allow you to steal a bike cool i dont know why but that bugged me also her dad is a dick your kid just crashed help them for god sake
May 12 2019,neutral,typical superhero movie entertaining for what it is but nothing special
May 12 2019,positive,this really exceeded my expectations what a pleasant surprise 
May 12 2019,positive,would have rated it higher the only problem with this movie is how predictable it was
May 12 2019,negative,attempted to he too funny which made it not funny the action scenes were ok not bad it was a decent movie if you look at the big picture its a set up movie for others to come in
May 12 2019,positive,so many origin stories are slow and gentle starters in the mcu at least i found this film satisfactorily engaging as was brie larson this is mcu not shakespeare or hemingwaycomics are fantasy and escapism and in that respect it meet its criteria for a hero that is supposedly the most powerful character in the mcu it was nicely tempered and wasnt over handled aside the small cameo roles in avengers endgame which was shot before brie larson starting captain marvel i cant wait to see a more action from brie as captain marvel soonthe numbers dont lie if this film wasnt entertaining or fed the fans of the mcu it would never have been a billion dollar success faster and higher baby
May 12 2019,positive,politics aside it was not an excellent movie nor was it a bad movie  it rehashed captain america the winter soldiers the good guys are the bad guys with an origin story for a overpowered female lead felt a little rushed and less polished than the previous mcu entries  it did contain hands down the greatest stan lee cameo ever
May 12 2019,positive,pretty good i was very interested in the story and enjoyed it i liked what marvel did with this movie
May 12 2019,positive,i enjoyed the movie a lot it was a lot of fun and it was very entertaining it was actionpacked i liked her dry air force humor i thought brie larson was funny and at the same time could be serious i also like her storyline of falling down and getting back up and how she is always being disparaged by others but keeps trying she doesnt give up i like the theme of womens empowerment  i like the empowerment of carol danvers maria rambeau and monica rambeau it is commensurate that is was released on international womens day march 8 2019     i thought brie larsons acting was very good there was a certain playful naivete that you would expect in a 20something woman coming into her own yet there was still a maturity that you would expect in an air force officer i can see her really developing her acting career i think she should do one more marvel movie at best and move on mcu seems to favor white men      one of the things i was thinking that the movie implies that the cree who rescue her got her name from half of her dog tags that were lying on the ground and they didnt have anything else to go by soooo what about her name tag that was clearly on the front of her uniform which was visibly intact after the explosion what about the other half of her dog tab which would have the hole in it and which would have had a chain through it around her neck     i thought it was odd how fury was talking to goose like a dog i thought it was a little over the top no wonder goose scratched his eye out     i noticed that a lot of the fan reviews are negative and its probably because a lot of them are hardcore fans of the comic book series im not a comic book reader at all no offense to those that are im just on into it they knew captain marvel as a man and its a bit challenging for a female to take over mans role when the fans have a certain character and feel in mind kind of like how katee sackhoff took over the role of starbuck in the new bsg tv series in 2004 im a bsg fan and i thought katee pulled off rather well i think marvel ignored the fans and did what they wanted to do because they needed a movie to develop the character for endgame however the fan ratings are not commensurate with the fact that the movie is still showing in major theaters two months later     overall i liked the movie a lot it was entertaining and a lot of fun i have seen it twice i will see it again i like the womens empowerment theme
May 12 2019,negative,disappointing i am a huge fan boy of edwards and flight test history so when i heard she was an air force test pilot i was really hoping for a character i could relate to the main character felt flat there was no character development and the story didnt even make logical sense all or at least most other marvel movies despite being about superheroes at least made logical sense
May 12 2019,positive,cool action flick love the feminist lead in the story though i didnt leave the theatre as happy as i did for wonder woman  and im a marvel over dc fan
May 12 2019,positive,carried by samuel l jackson
May 12 2019,negative,i thought thor the dark world was marvels rock bottom then they release this this was not a good film no emotion from brie larson she acted like she didnt want to be there and just wanted her check the cat gave a better performance then her overall this movie felt forced and she is way to overpowered just because she get something blown up on her i would recommend not watching this film
May 12 2019,neutral,an ok movie with nice cgi effects but with a lame character and a ridiculitation of characters like nick furyis not horrible but neither is a great fil
May 12 2019,negative,it really isnt something to ride home about the movie is basically just there to tell the audience how over powered she is before endgame not so much a good movie
May 12 2019,negative,no personality no âheros journey completely overpowered character worst female lead in a fantasy movie to date wonder woman alita these were fantasic films with female leads so no this is not a vote against a female hero this is against a bad movie that retcons a beloved franchise in the worst way
May 12 2019,positive,drags in a few places but overall found it funny and entertaining
May 12 2019,negative,its one if those maybe if i watch it again at home ill like it honestly though i doubt i ever will brees preformance is underwhelming and falls flat the script could have been written by a high school student in a drama class who is just looking to get a c grade to possibly pass the class but ends up failing 
May 12 2019,neutral,finally saw it and wow every youtuber was correct and all this people in the industrymediaand other outlet for pushing this female empowerment agenda this couldve have been awesome they should holla at dc for making good likeable female characters with out agendas no more stuff like this for me every following marvel from this point on will be research nick and cranny
May 11 2019,negative,brie larson is the exact opposite of likable the jokes are unfunny the visual effects are fine if they just didnt cast brie larson and had someone else direct it it would be a way better movie which yeah those are pretty big changes to make but hey at least it wouldnt suck nearly as much as this
May 11 2019,neutral,it was meh at best not bad but not that great either
May 11 2019,negative,a pretty boring movie feels much worse the amazing wonder woman
May 11 2019,positive,interesting character but the movie wasnt one of the better marvel stories
May 11 2019,positive,not bad not as amazing as captain america iron man blank panther ant man origin story
May 11 2019,positive,diverged from what they could have done but all around a good movie 
May 11 2019,negative,one of the blandest most uninspiring and pointless marvel movies the lack of main charater development and over done plotline cannot be saved even by nick fury this movie is a huge bruise on marvel movied and is not needed to be watched in order to see endgame this movie doesnt know what it wants to be but the audience sure knows it doesnt want this movie for the first female lead in a super hero movie in a while i was deeply let down by the faux feminism bad acting of part of brie larson overall cringe if i never see this movie again it will be a blessing
May 11 2019,positive,good film and a solid entry into the mcu with a nice twist in the plot i have to admit the cgi on fury was amazing better than alita
May 11 2019,positive,charismatische schauspielerin story fã 14r das marveluniversum ein wenig zu platt
May 11 2019,positive,i think brie larson was really dry and hard to root for in this movie which is weird since she has so much more personality in other movies that shes done the writing was good but lacked real development
May 11 2019,positive,great comedy and plot building
May 11 2019,positive,while not perfect an utterly enjoyable film that women will relate to
May 11 2019,negative,brie larson tries to hard to be funny all comedy in the movie falls short action is always good with marvel movies but comedy and plot falls short of even good
May 11 2019,positive,one of my favorite mcu films so far
May 11 2019,negative,pretty bad all around the mission was to creat a light speed engine but marvel needed light speed to get to earth to begin with really thats the plot line and bring larson has no personality so boring if not for the cat it would get 0 stars
May 11 2019,negative,the whole movie was just a social justice metoo political statement  just make a movie that everyone can enjoy instead of trying to make some grand statement
May 11 2019,negative,boring movie and brie larson
May 11 2019,positive,great film with monkey and an insight into ronin
May 11 2019,positive,this movie had a lot of bad buzz right before i went into the theaters and honestly after watching the film for myself i think people just overreacted its really not that bad i didnt hate brie larson shes a fantastic actress but i mainly blame the writers for writing her character a bit bland although i do get what the writers were trying to do and i think larson nailed the performance the writers were asking for samuel l jackson as a young nick fury was amazing definitely the highlight of the film for me ben mendelssohn as the villain was of course great and props to the writers for really making a good villain this time which i really hope sticks with the mcu going forward also a lot of 90s references since it takes place in 1995 the movie is definitely a very fun action superhero movie if you dont like that then you wont like the movie but if you do then youll probably like it i guess it depends what youre looking for to come out of this film this film its just for pure entertainment and fun its not the best or worst of the mcu films its somewhere in the middle for me if i were ranking it but i still think its a good time in the theaters
May 11 2019,positive,i thought this movie had some bad a scenes that made the movie entertaining marvel put a lot of effort in this i truly think this is one of my top 10s for mcu movies b
May 11 2019,positive,it has some fantastic visuals and clever humour and brie larson fit the role as captain marvel well however its story at times felt a little lifeless and needed that extra punch
May 11 2019,negative,wasnt a fan it was action packed but something was missing from the acting its hard for me to articulate captain marvel is the bland oatmeal of all the marvel movies seriously the best i can describe it lol the funny scenes were awkward to watch bc there was just no chemistry with the actors still worth a watch but dont go w high expectations 
May 11 2019,neutral,it has been a while since i slept in a movie im really disappointed with the performance of the oscarwinning actress brie larson i hope the next movie will be better for the strongest character in the mcu
May 10 2019,positive,other than a stan lee filled opening marvel logo the film starts out slow and takes awhile to get going as the film progresses you begin to embrace brie larsons comedic and brash portrayal of a tough woman who isnt afraid to challenge men everywhere on any planet carol danvers and jacksons nick fury combine to give you a quick witted and hilarious relationship of marvel characters reminiscent of thor and hulk in ragnarok as they say behind every strong man is an even stronger woman and in the case of captain marvel thanos better watch his back an extra appreciation for the nostalgia if you were alive in the 90s
May 10 2019,positive,its good but only good great main actors and good plot but i just could not care less about captain marvel shes so boring same problem as early thor shes just so overpowered its hard to feel anything hoping they give her some more baggage in the future
May 10 2019,positive,decent movie didnt know much about captain marvel before this
May 10 2019,positive,good characters okay story brie larson was okay in this movie not the best i might watch it again someday
May 10 2019,positive,woman power love bries unapologetic strength
May 10 2019,negative,bland protagonist sprinkles of feminism and contradicts how fury got his eye hurt
May 10 2019,negative,this would have been a lot more enjoyable without all the hollywood agenda being forced behind it i felt insulted did not enjoy it at all
May 10 2019,positive,solid flick very comic book and i mean that in a good way liked brie larsen as cm and solid performances by the other various actors
May 10 2019,positive,excellent movie that champions women and gifted individuals
May 10 2019,positive,no words can describe how empowering this movie is for girls and women
May 10 2019,positive,not a bad film at all plenty to tie it into the other marvel films and all actors did a good job with their characters  plus some impressive cgi to make samuel l jackson look young again overall however the movie doesnt have very many standout moments that wow you quite like some of the other famous marvel movie still worth seeing in theaters for all you marvel fans but if you arent a fan of comic movies id wait for a redbox rental
May 10 2019,positive,this movie doesnt have a heavy amount of feminism that everyone is making it ou to have but brie larson gives an ok performance and samuel l jackson gives in arrest performance overall its a good movie with a surprising villain and a couple of references that pleased me
May 10 2019,positive,another origin story that mixes 90s nostalgia is it breaking new ground no but it was incredibly fun
May 10 2019,negative,the movie was okay going into this i really wanted to like it and i was very hyped up then it started and i was confused that confusion carries far throughout the movie i know that she carol danvers was confused too and going through inner conflict as result of her amnesia the only problem i had with using that reasoning though was that we couldnt see the inner conflict in her face he told her to stop letting her emotions get the best of her but the only emotion i ever really saw in the beginning was annoyance boredom and frustration even when she woke up from her nightmare or lost control of her emotions in the fight i couldnt see any emotion it got better near the end with maria and her kid that along with carol and furys banter were pretty much the only times i saw real emotion in the film i know there was controversy around this film for the fact that shes not smiling and im totally cool with that theres no reason for her to do so but i had been looking for much more real emotion and inner conflict going into this movie in the ads it shows captain marvel get up after falling down multiple times i wanted to see the motivation behind that determination what motivated her i wanted to learn more about the carol before the amnesia i feel that way she could become much more relatable and when im asking for emotion thats not just me telling her to smile more thats not what im after my favourite character in the mcu its tony stark in all 3 iron man movies i tend to care and remember his personal struggle and conflicts more than i care about the villains he shows it on his face very well openly for us all to see it makes him the most relatable of all the avengers to me for that reason alone all im asking is for brie larson who is a great actress as seen in other films to allow more of that   vulnerability to get through i know she is supposed to be the strongest avenger and all but you get stronger by working through stuff by keeping going even when it looks bad by doing the whole being knocked down and getting backed up with all your inner conflict as well i believe she couldve shown this more and was given a script where this was possible i truly hope that for any other movies she might do she does so with more emotion all in all its a ok movie not necessarily the best but not the definite worst its below my standards for a marvel movie but its ok
May 10 2019,negative,honestly the buildup was so overated and everyone expected so much from her as her movie was launched a month before endgame the entire movie was a disaster and looking back at it now she wasnt even that important in end game   a forgettable movie for sure
May 10 2019,negative,storyline really weak character development lacking overall unimpressive for the strongest avenger
May 10 2019,positive,great addition to the mcu danvers is tough kind and the kind of superhero my daughters can be excited about and look up to men and women have amazing strengths to offer one another and share together but that doesnt mean we cant have amazing women and role models like carol danvers to show us how tough and powerful women can be these are messages i want my daughters to see on screen you can be strong you dont have to let toxic people define you you dont have to submit to men especially when those men are dismissive manipulative or abusive
May 10 2019,positive,lacking in the action department however a good story filled with fun along the way ben mendelson is once again fantastic
May 10 2019,negative,brie larson is officially the worst marvel casting of all time she isnt a believable actress on any level she constantly strikes superhero poses in the exact same fashion as my 3 year old everything else about this movie was very enjoyable
May 10 2019,negative,brie was horrible no personality a cadaver would have been more enjoyable on screen i liked the supporting cast but brie was an awful leading character this has truly been a disappointing movie wonder how much it cost disney ro convince reviewers to lie to us
May 10 2019,negative,captain marvel is boring and filled with more plot holes than a sweiz scheese
May 9 2019,negative,i think the cat was the most intriguing character in the whole film and deserves its own film franchise  in addition  the skrulls are evil so are the kree but the skrulls are definitely not refugees they are monsters
May 9 2019,negative,possibly the worst thing ive seen in my life and ive seen some messed up stuff
May 9 2019,negative,horrible movie watch it online dont waste your money
May 9 2019,negative,the film sucked thats all 
May 9 2019,neutral,samel l jackson and goose are the best part
May 9 2019,positive,really good origin story before the premiere of endgame do not watch endgame without seeing this she is basically an infinity stone
May 9 2019,neutral,was ok but with price of movies these days id wait for dvd  some stupid parts but whatever its a comic book movie  the tempo of the movie left some dead spots and i wish the lead was better  not worth 12
May 9 2019,negative,force feeding agenda tried to get past it but couldnt with the terrible lead actress very flat and id say one dimensional but that would be saying she has any at all how do some people make it
May 9 2019,negative,i heard the hype prior to seeing the movie i am a big fan of brie larson i loved her in scott pilgrim she is a great singer also so i was looking for a wonder woman film with a powerful female lead and i got something unexpected brie larson was not a good fit for this powerful lead role i though she was boring in the first half of the movie she is not a convincing super hero i enjoy jude law but even he could not help her performance i was glad to see nick fury also but his performance did not help brie either i love the mcu but this film was a disappointment however there is a bright spot my kids loved it they also love spongebob and fart jokes but they loved captain marvel keep in mind that they do not understand the art of crafting a backstory or plot holes or continuity or linking storyarcs or real talent my kids cheered and i cheered with them to fit in but this movie in my opinion does not fit in well in the mcu i think that the lead could have been better cast and the fight scenes suffered because of it this movie is no wonder woman and should not be mentioned in the same category two thumbs down for captain marvel
May 9 2019,negative,what did i just watch
May 9 2019,negative,cgi was decent but the story and acting was blah not sure what the point of the other mcu characters is with captain marvel being a god with he ability to do everything
May 9 2019,positive,true this is not the best mcu film but its not that bad i think brie larson is not bad but nick fury and the cat goose steals the show
May 9 2019,negative,one of the worst marvel movies there is no character development and the character isnt likable at all just a poor effort hopefully the next phase doesnt follow this path
May 9 2019,positive,captain marvel just became a feminist icon very good movie simple narrative but well constructed since the strong personality of brie larsons character sets the whole movie in motion
May 9 2019,negative,a poorly written movie that was completely miscast brie larson delivered a hollow performance in this one  captain marvel has historically been a boring twodimensional character and this film did nothing to make her more interesting something i was hoping it might do  with so many awesome and powerful female superheroes in marvel comics this movie feels unnecessary and was completely unfulfilling
May 9 2019,positive,i genuinely enjoyed this movie i wont go into huge detail but i was entertained and look forward to seeing more in the future
May 9 2019,positive,loved the character development it felt like top gun at times great story watching it unfold was even better
May 8 2019,positive,this movie was fantastic it had a warm story and the women were badass
May 8 2019,neutral,so out of the marvel movies ive seen this isnt in my top 5 its passable and it was fun enough the best part about it for me was the back to the futureish sequence of outdated product placement ooh blockbuster ooh radio shack remember when radio shack was a thing remember even further back before radio shack started to suck  but getting something of the ghostbusters kind of pr treatment kicked my enjoyment down a notch or so     im sorry you just cant dismiss all criticism as bigotry thats a jerk move and everyone who did so was a jerk demonizing people to that degree just because they were unhappy with this incarnation of the character is seriously lowclass     i will add that it was also not even my favorite captain marvel movie released this year that would be shazam
May 8 2019,negative,unlike most mcu movies this was just not enjoyable captain marvel kept being told not to let her emotions get the best of her yet she seemed completely emotionless at all times looking more like ai than human the movie was also completely predictable as it was easy to tell from the first 10 minutes that the skulls were the good guys and her team was the bad guys nick fury the cat and coulson were really the only thing enjoyable about this movie the jokes were above par for marvel jokes and brie larson just seems to be able to make all of the scenes she is in very cringe and not enjoyable to watch felt like a total let down and am hoping they make a scarlet witch movie as i love her and think she is much better than captain marvel
May 8 2019,positive,captain marvel is a sharp and eye candy film which boasts plenty of action and a great origin story for the new arrival captain marvel
May 8 2019,negative,brie larson was a selfabsorbed block of wood through the duration of the movie dont know if it was brie or the writers i just hope they fix it in the next one captain marvel is such an iconic and powerful character i really want to see her do well sam jackson as nick fury was wonderful especially with his interactions with ben mendolsson
May 8 2019,negative,not good at all save your money on this one
May 8 2019,negative,it has to be the worst marvel movie i have ever seen brie larson is a terrible and unlikable actor she never had to over come much in iron man he was beaten until with the help of pepper he was able to succeed he learned from his loss and thats what heros are supposed to do spiderman did it black panther did it the guardians did it etc absolutely zero character development and not fun to watch at all maybe make a movie about someone we want to see a movie about not someone whos comics never even make a profit and need to be rebooted constantly i am very excited for black widow however as long as it doesnt turn into an extremely forced movement movie that just makes their whole intended message seen like a huge joke
May 8 2019,positive,didnt think it was gonna be good but theres just something about this movie that gives me this feeling that makes me feel happy and idk definitely going to see this movie at least three more times on disney 
May 8 2019,negative,what is up with this actress it is painful each time she comes on screen the attitude and persona that she is going for is so unlikeable i hope they change the actress or sadly make this the last captain marvel series because she is so bad  having said that even if you take her out of the movie as most people on this site agrees with me its still a weak movie i would not recommend this movie to see
May 8 2019,neutral,character does not come off as charismatic effects good story is good but usually the characters are more charismatic and nice in the marvel movies it is easy to see through the acting of captain marvel it makes me feel like im not even watching a movie but great production
May 8 2019,positive,flat story lineright up there with tho the dark worldyeah not that good faithful fan here but not happy with the product offered up this time around alita battle angel a much better movie
May 8 2019,positive,very enjoyable and great story
May 8 2019,positive,three stars for visuals acting and editing the story has its strenghts and effect just the lead charakter seems a bit onedimensional so shes just born with that im strongercharacter mostly strength narrowly weakness wonder remorse or personal relation to aspiration and motive feels a bit generic id call it the supermantrap
May 8 2019,negative,high quality production and support cast but main character falls flat in terms of believability or character development all of the problems of a superman character causing her to be really boring and someone the watcher doesnt resonate to this movie was supposed to be showing a strong female character fighting against misogyny but her strength isnt earned and her struggles are forced too many stories trying to be juggled at the same time worst of all subsequent watches of other movies in the franchise no longer hold up from a timeline perspective due to careless mistakes some intentional for a cheap laugh arguably the worst mcu movie watch it for some great acting from samuel l jackson and akira ackbar and some impressive deaging
May 8 2019,negative,bland plot without serious character hero development
May 8 2019,negative,worst movie of the mcu by far
May 8 2019,negative,larson has less emotional range than wilson from castaway the movie had a lot of potential with most of the cast having great performances but a lead that cant act ruins it
May 8 2019,positive,it was a solid movie expected it to not be good but it answered a lot of mcu qusetions and pretty good twist with the skrolls
May 8 2019,positive,wow that was really good hit me right in the feels as i watched with my girls 
May 8 2019,negative,i hate marvel now it was sooo bad  bad acting just plain stupid
May 8 2019,negative,five stars for the cat and patch windu minus 4 for the main character with no personality weakness or likability 
May 8 2019,positive,great entertaining movie
May 8 2019,negative,is not the biggest thing
May 8 2019,neutral,mehwas a bit bland
May 7 2019,negative,i was excited to see this i loved gal gadots wonder woman and the strength she brought to the role so as more of a marvel fan i was really hoping to see something i could really encourage my two daughters to emulate i was disappointed the movie wasnt bad but it was bleh i found myself wanting to like brie larsens character but she never developed into the relatable hero the movie was had great moments and comical scenes i loved samuel jacksons cat interactions  but captain marvels confidence came across more as arrogance and i find that unattractive in a woman or a man
May 7 2019,negative,boring movie  i thought with all the hype that it would at least be interesting
May 7 2019,negative,found myself not caring about captain marvel character she lacks personality i have a hard time feeling any emotional connection to her
May 7 2019,negative,veeeery slow boring bad acting better off renting when the movie has a fifty percent discount very meh and bland
May 7 2019,negative,amazing effects a wonderful actress and an awesome plot all shouldve made this movie great unfortunately the main character becomes an absolute mary sue and comes off as a total dillhole it only gets worse in endgame
May 7 2019,positive,a bit formulaic for my taste but had some good action scenes cdw
May 7 2019,positive,a very average actionsuperhero movie with good action scenes forgettable plot and generic hero and villains
May 7 2019,negative,shame i paid money for this
May 7 2019,positive,another solid entry into the marvel cinematic universe it feels like it should have came out 8 years ago however
May 7 2019,negative,i was so excited to watch this movie but wow did it disappoint the actress being so smug didnt help dont bother watching as for me will be skipping the next captain marvels pass
May 7 2019,negative,the worst marvel movie
May 7 2019,negative,i will be honest i went and saw this movie twice i really wanted to get a full understanding of what it was the movie had to offer the second time i saw it i could take my hype and emotion out of the equation what i concluded was that this movie was mediocre at best larsons performance was dismal the writing was atrocious and the directing was nothing special the cgi wasnt half bad but if thats the highlight of the movie than you surly will be in for a disappointment the sjw agenda they were force feeding down your throat when watching this movie really put me off from giving this movie a better review if people want to make our childhood superheros into movies but what to add some new age flare to it i am fine with that but this movie executed on it poorly if they wanted to make a movie more sjw friendly to us normys they should have taken some notes from spiderman homecoming that movie felt a lot more organic when it came to addressing some of these issue and i absolutely loved it when you find out at the end of the movie that michelle is mj i was genuinely excited and happy i was glad she would be playing that iconic character opposite to peter parker it felt great because you got to know the character and create that sorta of emotional attachment to her before tying her to someone iconic and hold dear to our hearts also her chemistry with tom holland was really great you could feel it through the screen captain marvel missed that completely larson had little emotion and she failed on delivering it even at the end when she found out about the kree being the baddies and the skrull being hunted the only reason i dont give this move 1 star or lower is because i actually like the skrull twist and ben mendelsohn  samual l jackson gave great performances this movie imo ranks at the bottom of the mcu i wouldnt saw its as bad as thor the dark world but i honestly didnt think it was better than iron man 2 and that is saying something this movie felt like a phase 1 movie and honestly that is unacceptable after 11 years and all these other great movies like black panther winter solider ragnarok that came before it
May 7 2019,positive,the movie was went out off roll didnt follow the comics well like the scrolls always the bad guys and it didnt sprain probably how she got her powers it just only showed how she got powers and at the end she said shes going to help them it dont take that long to help them get a new planet
May 7 2019,negative,i didnt think it was possible to make a movie worst than the new ghostbusters well i was dead wrong
May 7 2019,negative,the cat was the best part i had no clue what was going on
May 7 2019,negative,arguably one of the worst origin stories that marvel has put out in the lsy 15 years not too excited about bree larson leading the mcu in the foreseeable future   â¹ï
May 7 2019,negative,cool visuals and action but completely lacks depth and character development wanted to like this one but it doesnt come close to the other mcu films also i get enough political messaging in every day life i can do without it when trying to enjoy a super hero movie 
May 7 2019,negative,horrible brie larson has the emotional acting range of a sea cucumber
May 7 2019,positive,shes a total badass
May 7 2019,positive,its good but not great smart but not brilliant get my drift it just misses on a lot levels so its ho hum
May 7 2019,negative,woke narrative forced down your throat
May 6 2019,negative,absolute garbage worst marvel movie to date
May 6 2019,negative,not a super exciting movie or character also pretty goofy looking not aquaman bad but definitely the worst character in marvel
May 6 2019,negative,disappointment there were some good points but mostly disappointing
May 6 2019,negative,does this mean that marvel became arrogant character is charmless and i dont know why fury and ronan showed up delivering message about  feminism fail hero origin movie fail entertaining movie fail in every way wonder woman is 100 times better
May 6 2019,negative,bad script poor acting the worse marvel picture ever waste of time and you dont need to wach it to enjoy avengers endgame fortunately
May 6 2019,negative,the movie seriously wanted for a villain that could challenge cm without that you never really felt worried for her which made for a boring action movie to be honest
May 6 2019,negative,25 is generous brie larson was painfully disappointing
May 6 2019,negative,it was confusing because it had no background information it was too long and too boring
May 6 2019,negative,worst marvelmovie produced the last decades
May 6 2019,positive,i dont hate this movie i found it entertaining but i dont love it
May 6 2019,negative,dont waste your money just see shazam instead
May 6 2019,neutral,the movie would have been amazing if brie larsons acting wasnt so hollow im not sure whether that is her fault or the directors
May 6 2019,negative,there is absolutely no reason why she should want to fight there is also no moment in this move where she shows an ounce of personality other than in pictures my hope is that she finds a reason for fighting and a personality worth showing to a paying audience over phase 4 and 5 of the mcu
May 6 2019,negative,it started off good but marvel couldve done a better job at casting someone better wonder women did an awesome job in portraying women however in this movie i felt like i wasnt really invited to join
May 6 2019,negative,not terribly inspiring
May 6 2019,negative,the movie simply did not do enough to endear the audience to carol danvers yes the character get terrible treatment from some men in the movie  but whats her personal stake in this whats her personal motivation the arc is flat the acting is flat and the ultimate payoff is that captain marvel just gets  stronger oki guess id rather sit and talk with wonder woman black widow or scarlet witch because i got to know them as amazing characters carol would probably just glare at me and zap the bartender for no good reason
May 6 2019,positive,one of the best marvel comic hero live action movies ive ever seen brie larson was amazing as carol danvers the 1990s captain marvell in the series she was a air force pilot in that timeline of the series loved the 90s theme in the movie and the soundtrack
May 6 2019,negative,i love the marvel movies but this one is total dogshit    the worst marvel movie of the 200319 crop    terrbile lead character   terrible story  wooden uncharismatic lead actor      if they wanted a strong female lead in the back catalogue then marvel should have expanded the black widow character using hawkeyeronan as a side kick  there is plenty of source material for this using the black widow and punisher story lines
May 6 2019,positive,great movie saw it twice
May 6 2019,positive,i went to watch the movie without seeing anything of the internet i found it very entertaining and felt powerful with her its really nice to see a woman being a hero sometimes  i started thinking about marvels heroines and i remembered the black widow  but on second thought she does not have her own film shes always making small appearances in the movies of the other heroes  i was sad to know that everyone was criticizing the film when it gave me a good feeling about overcoming that being human is to raise a thousand times and more
May 6 2019,neutral,blah not the typical witty marvel ive come to know and love 
May 6 2019,positive,the acting and the characters were amazing with the a little sneak peak of how endgame will look like
May 6 2019,positive,such a great movie with an incredible underlying message about enemies that arent really enemies ie kids in cages and a hero cat ties into avengers end game well so glad i saw it 
May 6 2019,negative,the movie has no plot ans she was stupid over power  there was no growth for a marvel character i like
May 6 2019,neutral,the heroine wasnt properly challenged and came off as a regular mary sue
May 6 2019,positive,made better because of endgame but a little lacklustre on its own probably the most interesting thing about it is that it establishes the skrull vs kree war    bree larson does her best to make captain marvel an interesting character as does the plot however the problem is that cm is a kind of inherently boring character shes way overpowered and that makes her invulnerable    not to worry superman is also invulnerable but hes still vulnerable because he has people mainly everybody on earth    so what makes cm vulnerable    at this time very little but thats because the plot of this movie is intentionally low stakes so theres little of consequence happening    so here she just makes friends and enemies all of whom largely survived the outcome
May 6 2019,negative,an underwhelming and mediocre movie with a bland protagonist bland cinematography and a generic plot the only thing good in this movie was the cat brie larsons portrayal of captain marvel is underwhelming and leaves very little to be desired
May 5 2019,negative,it was marvels version of green lantern very boring and relied too heavily on cgi it was the movie we needed to see before engame came out so it served its purpose at that samuel l jackson and goose made this movie enjoyable
May 5 2019,negative,sorry not a fan of captain marvel
May 5 2019,positive,this is proof we are destined to have a female president that is a super hero and i think its going to be my niece
May 5 2019,positive,overall i enjoyed the heck out of this from the costumes to the soundtracks and the flow between acts if i had one complaint it would be the lack of actual character development but with keeping carol in space it doesnt matter honestly with the people she left on earth im curious what they do next with her she is by all accounts one of the strongest in the mcu so how do they challenge her
May 5 2019,neutral,so for a movie on captain marvels origins and a woman hero as the main character i wanted more excitement more action and just more of everything they couldve done so much more with this script captain marvel for the 34 of this movie is a regular woman finding her way and suddenly in the last 15 mins she has a revelation wth and definitely does not compare to how awesome she is in endgame couldve been a better bridge 
May 5 2019,positive,tells her story well  ties into future avengers
May 5 2019,negative,the worst hero movie ever green lantern was better
May 5 2019,positive,a worthy edition to the mcu the film served its purpose of setting up some backdrop for endgame as well as set up future films
May 5 2019,negative,even vision was shown to have more of a heart than this characterization of captain marvel    i will put her story at the same level as fantastic four 2015 worse than chris evans fantastic four    younger viewers tend to see her as miss marvel  old viewers were expecting a male character    disney really messed up this story    the only scene worth watching is the 1st post credit scene
May 5 2019,positive,its ok movie but enjoyed it
May 5 2019,positive,captain marvel actor was wack
May 5 2019,negative,thor dark world was complete trash hands down the most boring and unwatchable mcu film even that trash hulk movie was better and yet somehow captain marvel was worse than thor dark world also captain marvel was pointless in endgame
May 5 2019,negative,while the action sequences were enjoyable the movie itself was full of bland dialogue larson and laws character had little to no chemistry and bening seemed so disconnected with the film overall this movie felt rushed to lead up to the final avengers movie leaving a sense of dullness and major eye rolling
May 5 2019,positive,not great not bad 
May 5 2019,neutral,setting the politics aside its not bad in the traditional sense but its definitely not good either
May 5 2019,negative,its an obvious downgrade in the mcu i was expecting an action packed intelligent well written clever movie that helped me get more hyped for endgame yet all i got was a crappy movie that did almost nothing right the main lead is wrong the message is wrong the scrolls look like their costumes were made in the 80s just an overall disappointing movie
May 5 2019,negative,complete trash terrible jokes boringslow story   half ass effort for a origin story
May 5 2019,positive,its not the best movie in the marvel cinematic universe but still very good not bad at all
May 5 2019,neutral,loved the cg origin mythos and power of captain marvel brie larson was just unlikeable and lacked charm or compassion when compared to others like ripley from alien alice from resident evil heroes like scarlet witch black widow xena warrior princess buffy et al 
May 5 2019,positive,this was acceptable
May 5 2019,negative,the worts marvel movie the same face all the time brie larson the cat made best performance nick fury ok and the cat
May 5 2019,negative,as a comics reader and marvel fan i hope that disney goes bankrupt for what they have done
May 5 2019,positive,another captain america movie only with a different gender playing the lead role there was plenty of everything but misses the mark in almost every aspect at times the movie felt as if it was just made for the sake of being made its passable as a okay movie at best in sri lanka the hype was low for the movie and now i know whyï 12 12 12 12
May 5 2019,negative,cgi and over power doesnt make a good film it was like marvel version of justice league she could just fly through whatever she wants to destory there wasnt any display of fight iq or heart something you see in captain america or iron man just a girl who won the over power lottery without any character depth
May 5 2019,neutral,if you want to see a quality marvel movie i wouldnt recommend captain marvel i found the acting from the whole cast to be on point but the story is not memorable at all and too many useless characters were brought in for no reason lots of lost potential in this movie 
May 5 2019,negative,super disappointed with this movie i went in super excited and left feeling like i completely wasted my time the dialog was so lame 
May 5 2019,positive,it has a good story line im kinda partial to it because of 90s nostalgia too not marvels top 10 but a good movie
May 5 2019,positive,it was a great movie i really enjoyed it im glad marvel has changed the origin story formula after dr strange it started to become a bit stale
May 5 2019,positive,its supposed to be how all this started
May 4 2019,positive,a solid marvel its no captain america but it ranks above dr strange larson didnt really lean into being a blockbuster marvel star tho seemed like she didnt want to diminish her oscarlevel craft by being genuinely entertaining still great tho
May 4 2019,positive,as a huge marvel fan i was so disappointed in this one  perhaps expectations were too high but they lacked humor and i felt she didnt connect to me as that character or with the film or the other actors in   general  i hope they get better i really want to like this character but i compared to wonder woman this female super hero movie missed the mark
May 4 2019,negative,worst movie by marvel yet i thought we were over these bland formulaic movies it seems the studio cared more about pushing an agenda over making a great movie
May 4 2019,positive,great movie captain marvel has a bright future
May 4 2019,neutral,dont like captain marvel character
May 4 2019,neutral,i would say the movie is just ok and nothing really to write home about by no means is it in the same caliber as other marvel movies
May 4 2019,positive,so powerful and funny a hero that we can feel and identified with and brie larson is just so good as carol danvers worth every minute of it
May 4 2019,positive,though underwhelming in execution this film still retains marvels charm and competence overall
May 4 2019,negative,the worst marvel movie ever
May 4 2019,positive,i wasnt sure what to expect of this film another superhero film but i enjoyed it immensely it doesnt take itself too seriously theres some great action moments and i enjoyed the characters the first seen on earth cracked me up
May 4 2019,neutral,heres the thing with captain marvel carol denvers is a strong woman with a really strong character dominant behavior way too powerful brie larson doesnt portray that tupe of character dont get me wrong shes a great actress but not for this role it doesnt feel like carol denvers at all
May 4 2019,negative,pretty disappointed with captain marvel as a hero  i loved multiple other aspects of this film but i found the protagonist somewhat dull and the plot confusing  i really hope they dont bring back captain marvel or at least brie larson because ive never seen any of her other movies but i really dont think her acting was on par with literally any of the other mcu actors  the film really felt confusing because marvel jumped right on board with all of this new information that she was told by people she didnt know well at all  i could not relate at all to this character and her immediate belief of what anyone says and i found her to be too obviously overpowered   it really felt like captain was separate from her powers and it was just generally uncomfortable to watch  i am all for some strong female super heroes but only if it is well planned out  i understand wanting more diversity in the heroes but i really think these characters need to make sense and not just feel like an invasion to a wonderful franchise that it feels like ive grown up watching  i really do hope that marvel either scraps the idea of this character being the new face of the franchise or finds a better person to fill the role
May 4 2019,negative,shoehorned into endgame
May 4 2019,positive,captain marvel suffers from a very weak opening and a few weak spots in cgi but the film overall succeeds in good performances likable characters a few clever twists and some other effects that are very impressive    not one of marvels best but an overall decent film
May 4 2019,negative,story tried to be clever and seems a rushed movie before avenger
May 4 2019,negative,only reason to watch this is that it is a marvel movie the character is not likable and as a comic fan this is not an interesting character i get that they need a female lead but black widow and scarlet witch are far more likable comics and characters i feel like i wasted money
May 4 2019,negative,brie larsons oscar chops didnt shine through in this potrayal of marvels captain marvel bad acting and poor plot and action terrible comedy does everything wrong only redeeming factor is nick fury slj
May 4 2019,negative,a for effort but b for boring
May 4 2019,positive,a very powerful avengerlove herfantastic movie
May 4 2019,negative,a waste of the 199 it was on sale for
May 4 2019,positive,this movie is incredible it has its faults but is incredible
May 4 2019,negative,the cgi skills were fantasic from a cinematic standpoint i was astounded by the backgrounds and costumes   for me the story left much to be desired it seemed to be leading us through a predictable story with a weak main character and a supporting cast doing their damnest to keep viewers engaged   while carol danvers looked the part i found myself holding onto the characters around her for the drive to stay in my seat i wanted to see fury and coulson grow into the versions of themselves we know and the bond they have already made me very reminiscent of avengers her pilot friend maria was a delight i was so engaged in her what she had to say and i thought that moment where monica picked out captain marvels colour scheme was great it was the most human carol was in the entire film she isnt at all relatable i didnt find myself idenifying with her at all in fact i was far more invested in nick furys reveal as a cat lover and as such any struggle carol had i didnt care for she is unlikable at best and a waste of screen time at worst monica piloting spaceships and helping skrulls totally prof wendy and her cat goose homing skrull refugees awesome carol flying through space and being the single thing that makes an entire armada fuck off nah its interesting sure but has she earned that   not a single marvel hero before has had the capabilities before to do that with the possible exception of the gotg who are a team not an individual   captain marvel is too overpowered to even our suspended disbelief with marvel films at current she is unnecessary though if i had been given ms marvel a muslim highschooler with a much more attractive personality i would have a different opinion    in short dont see this film even to complete phrase 3 the other avengers animosity to her in engame highlights how little she deserves this film
May 4 2019,positive,it is good but not great the supporting characters save the film this movie lacks the fun of previous marvel films its a decent start but i hope they have more fun with the next installment
May 4 2019,negative,meh not nearly as good as wonder woman not even close characters lacked any humanity nick furys role was just pathetic the only reason to see this is if you must have all the background you dont to see endgame but it really was a halfhearted effort by writers and actors
May 4 2019,negative,as far as a marvel film its passable but barely lack of personality from the lead role and no significant tension existed did a lot more telling than showing when it came to why the lead was a hero and expected the audience to just accept those as if they were established facts
May 4 2019,negative,the film does not have much appeal captain marvel is too strong compared to the rest her personality is also reflected too rigid lack of jokes to ease the tension for the audience anyway the effect of the film is also polished the fight scenes are beautifully expressedif you want to understand about the mcu you should see view only for the purpose of entertainment you should choose a different movie
May 4 2019,negative,bre wasnt the reason this movie suckedthe script was the reason
May 4 2019,positive,i enjoyed captain marvel i did not take the controversy surrounding brie larson into account when watching this and i feel that is unfair to punish this film due to that although it does bug me when people unnecessarily drag politics into movies but i truly shut any opinions on this subject when i was sitting in the screening i felt this movie was a weaker feature compared to most mcu films but it still had enough action and humour to have a good time watching brie larson is fine as captain marvel but i do agree with others that her performance at times is flat and she appear to show no emotion at times in this movie even though character states she shows too much i do think larson is a good actor and will do well with this character in the future sam jackson is great once again as nick fury and the cg to make him younger was phenomenal and was unnoticeable most of the time i did really enjoy this movie and fell it is another well done movie in this much beloved franchise
May 4 2019,negative,i really hate this movie it was so boring and it made me fall asleep it wasnt even funny
May 4 2019,positive,enjoyed this movie more than i thought i would 
May 4 2019,positive,one of the best movies they have done
May 3 2019,negative,the movie is alright the reason for one star is simply the rushed feeling for the character after infinity war the character is barely developed beyond the basic feminist ideals and they created such an overpowered character that there is no point in worrying about threats because ultimately she is written too powerful 
May 3 2019,negative,wishing another actor played captain marvel brie larson has rbf 247
May 3 2019,positive,really good movie with lots of action and good character development i especially like that we get to see more of nick furys origin story captain marvel is a very likable character and i hope to see her in several more movies
May 3 2019,negative,fell asleep 10 minutes in and slept like a baby for a good 20 minutes woke up and didnt seem to matter story was meh acting felt forced
May 3 2019,negative,capitalising on the oppression of women this movie doesnt mind stealing your money
May 3 2019,positive,definetly one of the best marvel movies ever loved every bit great action dialogues acting humor  you dont wanna miss this
May 3 2019,negative,was so excited to see this movie and it did not live up to the hype it is a little boring and drags on not enough action 
May 3 2019,negative,the movie mainly suffers from a drawn out plot which rushed once the ending neared some of the acting felt mediocre as a positive highlight however it doesnt come as surprising that the visuals effects are incredible
May 3 2019,negative,larson was very dull through the movie its hard to cheer on a hero who seems so disinterested in the whole time black widows movie will be better
May 3 2019,negative,i cant believe hollywood is even trying anymore they must be writing these movies as they go its awful
May 3 2019,negative,another boring origina story if you saw green lantern you seen this movie only this one has an overdose of girl power the movie forced feed 90 nostalgia with a horrible soundtrack from that era dont know how they managed that but they did dont waste your time
May 3 2019,positive,brie larson is a welcome addition 2 the mcu but girl power not withstanding the film is a must c 4 fans of the mcu captain marvel is a game changer from earth 2 the universe not unlike guardians of the galaxy which is where the mcu save black panther n dr strange is headed
May 3 2019,positive,i really liked captain marvel its by no means a perfect movie but it was entertaining jackson and larson had pretty good on screen chemistry and the story lined up better than i thought it would in the context of the mcu
May 3 2019,positive,brilliant paced action movie
May 3 2019,positive,not as good as it could of been but still good
May 3 2019,positive,having come before endgame trying to do a origin story is very ambitious but captain marvel shines on most opportunities its given a decent cast provides solid performances and a first standalone female protagonist for the mcu surely excited most waiting what we were left with was a halfdecent rendition of what we probably should have got after the epic conclusion to the saga
May 3 2019,negative,an average movie below average marvel movie zero charter development to op
May 3 2019,negative,were with shield  what    also i tought the chitauri was the first time aliens invaded earth  and what about furys eye  when he became director of shield he still had his eye that was waaay after captain marvel timeline    there is also a lot of other wrong things in this movie the writers are just lame    movie sucks a lot of plot holes  looks like the people who made this film didnt even care to watch the other films from marvel
May 3 2019,positive,im amazed how people judged bries acting just froma trailer this goes to show that humans are too judgemental    i watched the film twice and to begin with i was a neutral viewer aint a fan of brie larson at all and naturally i became a fan of hers after the film    to be fair it isnt easy to be a womanled hero on the big screen but brie pulled it off she brought out the character exceptionally well and she made the effort to interact with actual airforce pilots and reading up comics on captain marvel to immerse herself into the character she took up this film to promote awareness on gender equality and show to young girls that they too can lead on a big screen     yes a film is a film and its meant to be for entertainment but given this global platform isnt it more meaningful to make an impact for a better and fairer world in this already existing sexist misogynistic culture a picture speaks a thousand words much more a film    everyone of us here may or may not have a daughter in future and if we do im sure you would want your daughter to feel that shes equal to her male peers and that gender shouldnt matter
May 3 2019,negative,bad storylune antogonist character too weak
May 3 2019,positive,loved this movie captain marvel is such a great character this movie is great at showing you dont need to be overly feminine to be a valid woman
May 3 2019,negative,just a mary sue beating up everyone and everything
May 3 2019,positive,all round great film bit of a slow burner but shows us a well rounded cast especially for larson and jackson as a comedy action team nicely shot and decent story     only downside is the fact they downplay a super strong female character whose meant to dominate in this film i know directors were keeping the good stuff for end game and captain marvel 2 but would have been nice to seen a fully realised hero not held back
May 3 2019,positive,i dont see why everyone hates this movie its not great but its not awful its just like any other marvel movie solid story humor and action can fall flat though 
May 3 2019,negative,boring overhyped and most of all forced 
May 3 2019,negative,sucked bad  not into manufactured fake movies not part of mcu
May 3 2019,neutral,another meh marvel movie
May 3 2019,positive,got shivers all through out the movie
May 3 2019,positive,well written and acted with strong lead performance by larson and a plot that wasnt as contrived as some of the other super hero filmswell shot and directed girl power rules 04242019
May 3 2019,negative,an unnecessary addition to the avengers who uses undeserved smugness and bravado to beat up spaceships
May 3 2019,positive,the biggest highlight of the film is its dynamic relationship between carol danvers and nick fury 
May 2 2019,positive,a little slow at some points but overall it was actually pretty decent
May 2 2019,negative,brie larson cannot act and her omnipresent smirk gets old quickly    hopefully the mcu will give her the ed norton treatment before she destroys the good work done before her involvement
May 2 2019,negative,i was excited to see this as i heard good things about it  it was pretty boring i just couldnt wait for it to get over i wasted my money wouldnt see another marvel  also didnt like  who they cast as marvel either
May 2 2019,negative,the movie is very plain and follows the slandered marvel movie format however i must say that this movie is very lack luster and adds absolute no suspense or any thing new to its predictors
May 2 2019,positive,captain marvel is bad ass and the movie is super 90s samuel jackson is great in it
May 2 2019,negative,this was totally unnecessary some may see it as vital part of mcu continuity but for me you can safely skip this movie and still catch up with the overall storyline
May 2 2019,positive,probably my least favorite marvel movie it was entertaining just didnt feel the same vibe i usually get with marvel movies but after seeing her in endgame i am really starting to love this character im excited to see what they have in store for her in the future
May 2 2019,positive,this movie was well done it definitely seems like and is a storyline that helps tie in the other mcu movies leading up to endgame
May 2 2019,positive,this movie is pretty average and brie larsons acting is just pretty bad
May 2 2019,negative,i am huge marvel movie fan and would be happy if i never saw thus movie again
May 2 2019,positive,i was so excited for a female led marvel superhero film and ive enjoyed brie larson in other movies but in my opinion shes completely miscast in this her performance is flat and one dimensional and she lacks the charisma needed to embody a superhero 
May 2 2019,positive,loved the movie saw it a couple of times 
May 2 2019,negative,this was a swing and a miss samuel l jackson delivers a charming and funny performance ben mendelssohn is also great but by and large the jokes fell flat guardians nailed an era feeling in a way this film failed to do with the 90s perhaps marvel will figure out this character with time thor got progressively better so maybe this will i think brie larsen is a good actress but this character didnt quite click for me if you are trying to watch all marvel films before endgame id say you can skip the hulk and this movie
May 2 2019,positive,excellent being true to who you are on the inside story no matter how often you are pushed down held back or told you had to be something different loved the spirit of the movie oh and it was hilarious to boot
May 2 2019,positive,fun heartfelt and exciting brie larson was an excellent choice for captain marvel
May 2 2019,negative,it was slow didnt do much for me to move the marvel universe forward bries actings isnt well the supporting actors held this movie together
May 2 2019,positive,im all for empowering women and burning down the patriarchy but not with shoehorned political messages like this wonder woman showed us what it was trying to say captain marvel just preached
May 2 2019,positive,classic superhero origin story with likeable characters funny moments and an awesome 90s soundtrack the actors are all quite good from series mainstay samuel jackson to newcomers ben mendelssohn and brie larsen but they simply arent given much to do i briefly fell asleep during the first third and had to finish watching it on a second viewing aside from one notable and interesting plot twist it sticks to the marvel formula
May 2 2019,negative,boring movie with boring lead
May 2 2019,positive,my daughter gets to grow up in a world with movies like this
May 2 2019,negative,a shit show on fire  way to crowbar in a character nobody had every cared about at any point  how many different times have they tried to reboot the comic only to have it fail miserably  shit story to begin with save yourself the money and download this illegally please lol  then dont watch it just seed it
May 2 2019,negative,the worst marvel movie even worse than the incredible hulk without any plot and just to give a femenism message the thing is that is not well given
May 2 2019,negative,trying to hard to make girls power full should have focus more on carter and brie larson is a treble actress
May 2 2019,negative,all i can say is that the cat stole the show 
May 2 2019,positive,good movie but the ending doesnt show progress the fact that she has to cheat to win a fight doesnt really  shows that she hasnt learned anything
May 2 2019,negative,overrated  disney is seriously forcing this everyones throat
May 2 2019,negative,its not that great plot is weak main actress is bad
May 2 2019,positive,a fresh character for mcu the movie was overall good with some marvel origins the cat was a good catch to the movie keeping it going plot was good by keeping some excitement for last by making the good guys bad good movie
May 2 2019,positive,good family film to watch furys character was a bit poor in this movie i still dont understand how she becomes so powerful but she played the role very well and looks great too pc in our movies isnt good
May 2 2019,positive,felt rushed was very predictable kind of generic super hero origen story this movie should have happened in phase one where it would have fit in more still fun though just ultimately forgettable
May 2 2019,positive,i dont understand why this has been receiving such mixed reviews from fans i personally loved how they introduced carol danvers into the mcu and helped further expand the universe that we already knew was bigger than just earth its by no means a masterpiece there are some issues with it such as the uneven timing and convoluted narrative however the plot twist regarding the kree and the skrulls more than makes up for that 
May 2 2019,positive,i love all the other caracters better the females too  if you make a too op caracter give herhim an edge make the caracter comicly over the top or make him a really bad person with a gold of hearth if steve rogers dont like bullies no matter where they come from then he should battle with her xd
May 2 2019,positive,not much stands out here to rave about after what seems like a lifetime of marvel superhero films weve seen pretty much everything here in the other standalone films but with better directing and visuals brie larson is the reason to see it if anything i think her character is pretty onedimensional but shes still a treasure to watch no matter how surfaced of a role shes playing getting to see furys kittytime is also a big highlight from this its pretty much an obligatory viewing solely to prepare for avengers endgame but i dont see it on any top 10 superhero list in this realm
May 2 2019,positive,i put this movie off due to the user reviews sorry i did that it was completely entertaining those not liking may have been misogynistic or had ridiculous standards for a comic book movie it was a lot of fun
May 2 2019,negative,what a mary sue character she doesnt have that feel of a super hero she just a woman who thought she got verbally abused by male pilots and pushed around at training camp   if youre so strong then do it like one punch man hes the strongest hero but there are many down sides to him show those sides but noooo not captain marvel she just the most boring super hero character
May 2 2019,positive,good for an introductory movie
May 2 2019,negative,very boring only reason it got a whole star is because there was some parts that made me chuckle a bit
May 2 2019,positive,it is a very nice and entertaining movie 
May 1 2019,positive,fastpace and funny 
May 1 2019,neutral,captain marvel doesnt have a good character arc she was shoehorned into the mcu
May 1 2019,positive,2nd favorite movie next to endgame 
May 1 2019,negative,i must be missing a point i cant find a place on the timeline  for captain marvel apparently its 6 years after 1989 which gives us 1995 so captain america was the first avenger before the avengers even exist according to captain marvel plus the tesseract locationpossetion wont add up if we follow the timeline from captain america the first avenger 1942 to captain marvel 1995 so many questions so many unanswered questions
May 1 2019,negative,a movie only to pass the time nothing special or remarkable about it
May 1 2019,positive,great movie i have watched it multiple times would watch it again
May 1 2019,negative,it was an ok movie measuring it with the scale mcu has set in a decade  totally changed the all authoritative and visionary character of nick fury  and kind of same vibe as the superman had a super hero that is more powerful then everyone else
May 1 2019,positive,it was a decent movie with a ton of action
May 1 2019,negative,extremely passable movie with a hint of political correctness and telling people to be easily offended by simple comments half a star is generous
May 1 2019,negative,this is without a doubt the worst movie in the mcu franchise it is nothing more than obvious propaganda whats worse though is that it doesnt even have decent writing or direction to disguise said propaganda i would rate this zero stars if i could
May 1 2019,positive,amazing movie the story line ties into other marvel movies
May 1 2019,neutral,after so many other cleverly written smartly comedic  incredibly entertaining marvel movies this was a major letdown i was expecting to laugh  tear up  be engrossed in a smart story with great special effects the special effects were pretty good
May 1 2019,neutral,its a fine introduction to the character but the movie is below par
May 1 2019,positive,great movie and great actress
May 1 2019,positive,i thought captain marvel was brilliant movie you couldnt of picked a better actress than brie larson as captain marvel its like scarlett johansson as black widow just cant ask for better actress as them but overall all bad ass movie before going to see end game u all should watch this movie first thing as captain marvel going play a big role in endgame
May 1 2019,positive,definitely enjoyable and a great addition to the mcu
May 1 2019,negative,really boring with no true storytelling accomplished
May 1 2019,positive,honestly really enjoyed this movie i loved the dynamic between carol and fury it was fun and they were cute friends and i loved the cat
May 1 2019,negative,it wasnt completly horrible but it could not compete with other movies in the same genre wonder woman was way better and im not a huge fan of dc it felt very slow and i cant say i ever felt like i actually cared about the characters or what was going on in the movie at all it lacked emotion and therefore any kind of emotional reaction from me  only watched it because i was hoping for some clues to avengers endgame
May 1 2019,negative,i didnt watch the movie i watched the abridged version i regret it ever since why couldnt they just keep her as ms marvel and have her own story her story was novas  story
May 1 2019,negative,acting was lacking from the lead
May 1 2019,positive,this was a very fun movie
May 1 2019,neutral,for a marvel movie i was disappointed it was hard for me to relate to her not enough backstory either she didnt even seem upset or regretful when she found out she was on the wrong side it was actually boring on a few spots
May 1 2019,positive,only reason why i like this film is because it was the start of the avengers and to nick fury the action scene is really good brie did a really good job in portraying her character
May 1 2019,negative,two stars for the graphics only
May 1 2019,negative,captain marvel has many issues and the issues do not lie in creating a perfect female who the audience is unable to relate to youre too emotional is said to marvel over and over again but the truth is she didnt show any emotion whatsoever the only time the movie shined is when positive female emotion was pushed to the forefront and allowed to shine other than that marvel attempted to be one of the guys when she shouldnt be a quick witted hero archetype like every super hero and action hero she had the potential to be more but wasnt we love characters like captain america spiderman and iron man because we see them go through real struggles and mistakes at the beginning marvel is already one of the most powerful person on her team her only struggle is memory loss and when thats overcome she becomes so powerful it isnt interesting no one wants to watch lebron play 1 on 1 against a 5 year old what we needed was more feminine moments to shine through the film just wasnt a good
May 1 2019,negative,waste of time and money
May 1 2019,positive,i wantet popcon kino with op hero i got popcorn kino with op hero
May 1 2019,negative,uninspired extremely boring captain marvel has absolutely no personality
May 1 2019,negative,for a genre superheroes that has shown they can be different wacky fun or serious this movie truly feels like just another one the bunch it fails at character development and creates too many incongruencies with ite shared universe canon furthermore it feels like it was just made to make it not because the char was important or interesting but purely purely to make money out of a very empowered group of people and this group of people blinded by the imagery and spectacle do not realize that the cause they fight for is misrepresented in this film this people get caught in the hype and the explosions not realizing how empty and negative the film actually is to them and others the movies counterpart wonder woman had many flaws but it succeded in telling a much more compelling story and giving off a much more positive message than cpt marvel if i were to say group of people watch wonder woman instead of cpt marvel do not endorse a character and movie that will cause you and your cause harm
May 1 2019,positive,this movie was hyped to much
May 1 2019,neutral,the movie is set in very interesting period of time and thats the only reason i finished this movie  this movie is filled with unfitting humour that ruines the moments and main heroines role is unrelatable and unlikeable
May 1 2019,positive,captain marvel is not in the top tier of marvel movies it has its quirky moments and is a very empowering movie but bu the end of the movie i felt   dissatisfied with the hero 355 for a marvel movie not the best but its still a decent movie half a star was added for the best character in the movie the god himself phillip j coulson
May 1 2019,negative,high expectations brought about a bit of a let down fun in most parts but underwhelming predictable and empty relative to other marvel films
May 1 2019,positive,good movie worth the money 
May 1 2019,positive,captain marvel is a good movie the kind of movie that you go to watch in order to spend some quality time i found the narrative very simple which is why i cannot give a better rating    nice movie to watch when you want to log out of the real world for a little
May 1 2019,negative,in my opioinion acting was no better than average and plot was sophmoric
May 1 2019,negative,very bland and poor character development
May 1 2019,negative,this movie is too shallow what is the main character struggle the action is mediocre the jokes are lame just an overall disappointment
May 1 2019,positive,whilst a perfectly serviceable if formulaic marvel movie its definitely one of the lesser entries in the series
May 1 2019,positive,i loved the movie the tone was consistent throughout the writing was good it hit all of the right story beats brie larson is a great actress despite her lack of stage presence in celebrity interviews the interactions between characters and the development was right on track the only small complaint i had was that her hair somehow floats perfectly in space and stays curled like after a saloon visit no matter what but hey hollywood magic right honestly the trepidation i had going in was unnecessary and i felt that it was a very entertaining and good stand alone movie
May 1 2019,negative,what more could i say
May 1 2019,positive,i thought this was a well done albeit late to the party origin story if youre able to view it as an individual story rather than ask where she was in earlier movies youll do well well acted well shot and well written  definitely worth a look many of the other poor reviews misogynism is alive and well 
Apr 30 2019,negative,no spark and almost no fun this film falls flat and leaves the watcher unsatisfied
Apr 30 2019,neutral,i wasnt terrible but by no means at all was it a good movie
Apr 30 2019,positive,original film of captain marvel shows the humanity from the carol denvers make him confused about anything and after she know who she is she become unstopabble  good film   
Apr 30 2019,negative,sooo i went into this with an open mind and let me be the first to tell you that it sucked as much as everyone said it would bree lawson is about as exciting to watch as paint drying
Apr 30 2019,neutral,what i expected at the very least is a solid entry in my favorite superhero franchise with a fairly decent story but the movie and the script in particular really has some serious issues a first act that is nearly unwatchable incoherent mess thats littered with an unbelievable poorlyedited scenes major pacing issues a blatantly generic origin story shamelessly stolen and also underdeveloped themes and plotlines from other movies a glaring lack of a fixed tone unremarkable and sometimes even incomprehensible action sequences expositionheavy dialogue flimsy characterization to name but a few    let alone tons of absurd and cringeworthy stuff paying homage to the 90s by showing slow loading processes and notworking web pages a pandering to diversity through the movies socalled messages in a most heavyhanded and superficial way outdated cgi some of the corniest and cheesiest lines etc    as much as i love this franchise the humor in mcu usually doesnt work for me as it does for many people but i cant remember not chuckling even once during every one of these movies in captain marvel though i swear that i didnt even smile for one time    also i hate to say it but brie larson is really stonefaced here i just want to let you know that her oscarwinning performance in room is one of my alltime favorite performances by an actress    what i liked    the deaged samuel l jacksons nick fury is incredibly impressive  goose the cat is just a scenestealer  i didnt expect the plottwist to be honest i wasnt invested in the story in even the slightest degree though  the first act is stupidly chaotic and fastpaced that didnt bore me for a second so thats a plus i guess  the second act is interesting at some points and its when the story begins to find its footing  its not a boring movie overall in fact its quite enjoyable except for the absurdly overlong third act that almost made me want to skip and fast forward till i get to the very end      overall captain marvel is a soulless and bland scifiaction movie and an undeniably secondtier superhero flick that doesnt deserve to be among most of the installments in an otherwise marvel franchise    510
Apr 30 2019,neutral,was no where near as good as expected wonder woman was much better
Apr 30 2019,positive,i was entertained through the entire movie and that is all i ever ask when i go to the theatre
Apr 30 2019,positive,so its a alright movie just a very boring character
Apr 30 2019,negative,i see the movie and i dont see what the russos brothers say and the filme is so forced her power
Apr 30 2019,negative,extremely disappointing
Apr 30 2019,neutral,it was a pretty good movie dragged at first but finished with a bang a very powerful feminist movie
Apr 30 2019,positive,nice addition to the marvel franchise underrated as much as black panther was overrated dont let the political nut jobs fool you
Apr 30 2019,neutral,the filmmakers think that in order to make someone look strong you need to make them emotionless and i just dont agree
Apr 30 2019,negative,totally unnecessary this character was boring and one dimensional 
Apr 30 2019,positive,the movies plot is reasonable the effects are impressive and i found only a fraction of it to be even slightly unenjoyable
Apr 30 2019,positive,this movie was amazing
Apr 30 2019,positive,so much funnier than i expected she was strong flawed funny sassy emotional  everything i wanted her to be great action interesting plot loved it
Apr 30 2019,negative,it wasnt exactly the best
Apr 30 2019,negative,the cat and samuel jackson carried the movie to two stars
Apr 30 2019,negative,it was the worst marvel film i ever saw   the main actress is terribly bad on her role even if the concept is good but at no moment i felt tension drama or any good emotions exepting a sensation of superiority im the best and you are trash  dont waste your money tomatoes lie to you
Apr 30 2019,negative,an embarrassment to the marvel franchise
Apr 30 2019,positive,better than expected
Apr 30 2019,positive,doing this for info 101
Apr 30 2019,negative,nope why is this movie even a thing
Apr 30 2019,positive,overhyped mcu is in trouble
Apr 30 2019,positive,good as a movie bad as a comic book movie the usual disney style they changed captain marvels origin they changed skrull not serious like the comics too much cheesy silly stuffs
Apr 30 2019,negative,not very entertaining possibly the worst in the mcu seemed too cartoony with a week back story and lack of a true villain
Apr 30 2019,positive,captain marvel sets up a snarky btchy hero that takes sht from no one however this also makes her feel paper thin yeah shes powerful but her motivation and emotional scale lacks which is too bad for such a talented actor such as brie larsen the story and effects are otherwise all great with some weird moments here and there but the movie works as an origin story lets hope carol has more to offer after endgame which her character was also way underutilized in 
Apr 30 2019,positive,funny great story line and she was badass
Apr 30 2019,negative,the movie had soo much potential but became a canvas of political and sjw hits instead 
Apr 30 2019,negative,the character has no character brie has nothing to work with and this movie is really the beginning of the end for marvel ironman had to work and fall captain marvel starts the movie beating the big bad villain and the arc essentially boils down to realizing just how great she is but this would have been better illustrated if we see her failing earlier on because she does not have confidence just overall really messy and i feel bad for the backlash brie had to take for this character
Apr 30 2019,positive,it was better than expected
Apr 30 2019,negative,its an ok movie up until the last 20 mins when it takes a serious nosedive poor writting with plot holes and essentially no character development
Apr 30 2019,negative,a filler of film and easily forgettable captain marvel doesnt do much to stand out and it cant be helped by larsons stoic performance and questionable choices that ruin a lot of mystery behind some mcu secrets with a clear agenda here it would unwise for marvel to look to carol danvers to take the mcu forward after endgame
Apr 30 2019,negative,marvel has fallen into the dc superman trap they created the perfect character and as a result there was no development and no interest
Apr 30 2019,negative,this is a really bad movie the script meaning of the film and the incredible form to kill some characters the way explain things are so forced it is not necessary to see this movie  if the do a second one pls just do and script that talk by it self  and pls dont mess it up
Apr 30 2019,negative,the movie has some entertainment value and sam jackson does a good job to try and make brie larsen somewhat tolerable for me i could never believe that danverslarsen could ever win a fight against any opponent within the first 30 min she looked as if she had never run before in her life
Apr 30 2019,negative,literally the most average superhero movie ever  copied and pasted from iron man but while rdj is extremely likeable fun and flawed brie larson is a basic mary sue who is not entertaining at all
Apr 30 2019,negative,mehmarvell made a bad choice
Apr 30 2019,negative,if captaian marvel was a man the critique rating would be a 75 at best even with the citrusy disney agency this is a clear example of marvel show horning in a last minute mary sue just so end game could be more diverse next time focus on the actual talent of actors rather than theirs sex 
Apr 30 2019,negative,characterization could have been better so much potential
Apr 30 2019,negative,the character is boring and the only thing special about her is having more power than most heroes 
Apr 30 2019,positive,it was fun and exciting i liked the twist and was impressed how they made fight scenes with such a powerful character still feel punchy     only critics is was the music didnt always feel in line with mood of the scenes  and minor spoiler    fury didnt do much in the movie despite having a lot of screen time a little bit of bummer but didnt take away  from the story to much to me
Apr 30 2019,negative,just didnt enjoy it as i have with all the other marvel movies
Apr 30 2019,positive,i dont normally rate movies but i felt the need to saynsomething here dont let politics stop you from enjoying a good marvel movie and no im not just a marvel fanboy i didnt like black panther thor darkworld ironman 2 or 3 but this one is good
Apr 30 2019,neutral,fairly entertaining movie with great visuals they didnt do the character of carol denvers justice very stiff performance by brie larson unfortunatly no emotional investment in the character after watching the movie character didnt struggle at all during the movie all in all it is in the lower end of marvel movies in my opinion
Apr 29 2019,negative,nothing but feminist propaganda and a messy script the trolls were right all along
Apr 29 2019,negative,best part of the movie is the alien cat and he need his origin movie
Apr 29 2019,neutral,it was an okay movie with some minor   flaws
Apr 29 2019,negative,definitely the runt of the litter wish they would have casted a good actress brie was boring and unlikeable this movie was totally rushed 
Apr 29 2019,positive,captain marvel definitely shows women impowerment computer animation is beyond amazing great story line second best marvel film of the year
Apr 29 2019,negative,brie larson cant act herself out of a cardboard box
Apr 29 2019,neutral,captain marvel was a good entry in the marvel movie mythoshowever that is all it was just good in now way was there any effort to raise the thrill or challenge the ever curious denizens of minds it was just another marvel movie that wasnt bad
Apr 29 2019,positive,answered some of the questions i had
Apr 29 2019,negative,cgi and fighting scenes are v cool samuel and the cat r amazing but i saw no character development for captain marvel def have seen better portraits of heroines
Apr 29 2019,positive,best origin story marvel movie to date finally got a kickass movie with a kickass superhero who checks all the boxes and truly represents the best of a strong female character all on the big screen
Apr 29 2019,negative,movie was alright nothing special and i personally felt the writing was not very strong as they did not appear to understand how to write a heros journey she was strong in the beginning strong throughout to the end and never appeared to have any trouble handling any issues
Apr 29 2019,positive,it was pretty good nuff said
Apr 29 2019,negative,one of the worst marvel film since f4
Apr 29 2019,negative,just another disney rip off movie people go see it because they tie in avengers ill had it to disney they know how to sucker people in to giving them money  dc needs to get its act together because a change of pace is in order i think
Apr 29 2019,positive,this was my favorite marvel movie to date i loved the story the action visual effects and overall representation of women in this movie it had sweet moments funnyemotional and action pack sceens that didnt disappoint i will be buying this one when it comes out
Apr 29 2019,positive,only reason i watched end game havent seen other avenger movies loved the comedic timings and subtle jabs at the male dominated franchise strong advocator much needed fresh air
Apr 29 2019,negative,well the movie was rushed and really lacked originality like the other movies it felt like it tried to recreate something like guardians of the galaxies and a find yourself movie
Apr 29 2019,negative,one of the worst marvel movies brie is completely unlikable saw the film because i thought it was important to the overall arc of phase 13 but in hindsight this film was unnecessary there is one thing to have a character arc that shows a character growing and overcoming a challenge in their life its quite another to just have a film about how the evil white man has kept a woman down just because shes a woman skip this film
Apr 29 2019,negative,generally okay plot is extremely basic and fails to to enrich the mcu focussing mainly on the 1970s aspect of the storyline samuel jackson is this movies biggest redeeming quality the main character is also needlessly overpowered creating a lack of tension at any point in the film the final battle actually had me surprised as i felt like the movie had more to tell prior to its ending one of the few misses in the mcu
Apr 29 2019,positive,this was one of the best mcu movies i have seen in years  the story structure pacing plotting humor and action were superb  the fx and cgi  must be seen on the big screen  amazing all around
Apr 29 2019,positive,great movie all i expected it to be and more
Apr 29 2019,positive,a feelgood superhero movie with a witty female lead reminiscent of the original buffy
Apr 29 2019,negative,just a cringy movie
Apr 29 2019,positive,thought it was good and better than expected nice humor entertaining 90s nostalgia not too bad a bit superman
Apr 29 2019,positive,finally a woman solo movie  in mcu 
Apr 29 2019,negative,boring wishing a skipped this marvel almost fell asleep while watching it
Apr 29 2019,positive,interesting but nothing innovative
Apr 29 2019,negative,this movie just lacked any kind of interesting storyline to follow that wasnt nick fury related the emotionless acting and tacky dialogue made some check their phones to see how much longer until the end high expectations disappointing results
Apr 29 2019,positive,loved the bad ass female super hero and really wanted to love this movie but it was missing something
Apr 29 2019,negative,this is a prime example of a tell not show plot  there is tons of exposition telling us how great of a person carol is but she really does not get a chance to show that greatness  her powers are scaled far to high considering that she is able to destroy a vessel with one hit that an entire planetary defense force of an advanced civilization could only slow down for a few moments  lazy writing that will result with ongoing issues for the mcu
Apr 29 2019,positive,captain marvel delivers an amazing origin story of the marvel cinematic universe first female solo film brie larson portrayed the title character so well i hope to see more of captain marvel throughout the franchise along with more female solo films walt disneymarvel studios it looks like you did it again outstanding job 78
Apr 29 2019,negative,the half star is for the cat and jude law there is nothing else introduced to the mcu thats worth mentioning  this movie is straight up ish
Apr 29 2019,positive,this is a movie that gives you a good time you can tell it was made just so when you watch avengers endgame you dont ask who she is take this movie with a grain of salt
Apr 29 2019,positive,a solid effort but it could have been a lot better too much message and not enough story if they had given carol danvers some flaws she had to overcome she could have been a great hero but as it is shes little more than a mary sue and isnt even referred to as captain marvel at any point in the film im afraid marvels best bet at this point would be to make a brotherhood of evil mutants movie culminating in the climactic battle between rogue and danvers on the golden gate bridge and having rogue permanently absorb carols powers and pysche like she did in the comics they could then rebuild carol danvers from the ground up and have her become binary in a sequel then captain marvel again brie deserves a chance to play a version of carol danvers that has something she needs to overcome with real effort
Apr 29 2019,negative,movie suuuuuuuucked horrible story line this movie does nothing for the mcu
Apr 29 2019,positive,excellent film a tremendous addition to the marvel cinematic universe  neatly tying in some familiar faces and events from previous marvel films while firmly carving out its own niche in the universe captain marvel does not disappoint on any level  tight story heart pounding action and excellent character development  a must see
Apr 29 2019,positive,great cast comic relief in the right places some unanswered questions watch it on the big screen
Apr 29 2019,neutral,it was just average nothing too special about it wasnt abysmal but compared to much standards was one of the lower rankings im not a troll for people who think that captain marvel can only receive positive reviews
Apr 29 2019,positive,whilst this is good enough to satisfy fans of the marvel universe it will not live long in the memory like so many of its predecessors worth seeing nonetheless   top tip those familiar with the franchise will know the feeling of weighing up whether to sit through extensive credits for the teasers the first one at the start of the credits is worth seeing the one at the end of the credits really isnt
Apr 29 2019,negative,this couldve been good felt like a basic follow these points take no risk i dont really care about these characters modern disneymarvel flick other than that it wasnt bad but i really didnt gain anything from watching it much reminiscent of that green lantern movie
Apr 29 2019,positive,some holes however great movie
Apr 29 2019,positive,this movie was better than expected  yes brie larson was a bit dry but for what the story was it was good  hopefully in future captain marvel movies she will be able to develop the character a lot more  the mcu does really good with character developement and hopefully that streak will continue
Apr 29 2019,positive,it was actually a lot better than i expected it to be i loved it
Apr 29 2019,positive,it was an okay marvel film i think i dont like the character for the same reason i have never been a superman fan characters without flaws and weaknesses are not compelling at least with thor when he was cocky he was also a buffoon carol danvers is a cocky know it all but sam jackson was awesome and the supporting cast was amazing
Apr 29 2019,positive,i enjoyed the orgin story of captain marvel it hit all the points it needed to with mix of comedy and action it a great addition to the mcu
Apr 29 2019,negative,stale boring wooden acting from brie worst mcu movie to date wonder woman did female empowerment right 
Apr 29 2019,positive,this movie is awesome and underrated a lot  also captain marvel have            captain america s courage             iron man s humour        and thor s power
Apr 29 2019,negative,way overrated wooden performance no emotional connection to main character poor storyline my least favorite marvel movie to date if i wasnt under the impression it was necessary to see before endgame i wouldnt have sat through it
Apr 29 2019,positive,i really liked the move and i think that brie larson is perfect for the role
Apr 29 2019,positive,very goodthe special effectseverything 
Apr 29 2019,positive,i liked this movie more than i thought i would it kept me entertained and answered some questions 
Apr 29 2019,negative,really was hit and miss on the plot line  and the main character really came across as unlikeable and bland  would not recommend
Apr 29 2019,negative,went to see this after avengers end game as didnt know who cm was rather wish i hadnt as i thought this one of the worst marvel films ive seen incredible to say but my mind ended up wondering during the film im usually totally focused on a marvel film but this one is slow and the characters quite wooden even nick fury seems quite dull special effects were great but the story line didnt do it for me
Apr 29 2019,positive,marvel perfected its approach towards a woman superhero by hiring an actual feminist i still cant believe people hate it without even watching it its perfectly scripted and directed and never lets you get bored brie larson has done an amazing job in bringing the character to life once you watch the movie you know that no one else couldve represented the character better and this is what mcu is proficient in samuel l jackson didnt have this much standalone time since the first avengers and the winter soldier movie and this time he has more screen time than any other mcu movie ever and thats just appetite couldnt really imagine any actor to share the same screen with him and equally shine but brie did the movie is an absolute must watch go treat yourselves
Apr 29 2019,positive,was a good movie just after infinity war just wasnt good enough for a marvel movie 
Apr 29 2019,negative,the movie was sadly very unsatisfactory it lacked backstory and any kind of character development it was filled with stupid and nonsense decision making from both sides action scenes have been almost exactly the same for the last 10 movies so theres that only good thing about this was the deageing of samuel l jackson
Apr 28 2019,positive,great movie fun and empowering for women and girls of all ages brie larson is awesome  lots of twists that throw you for a loop each time great sound track bravo to a superhero who is beautiful sexy compassionate yet tough as nails   captain marvel rules
Apr 28 2019,positive,captain marvel is a superheroine whos big power comes from her spunky attitude that comes from a woman who doesnt let men tell her what to do better than expected 
Apr 28 2019,negative,this movie was the utmost disspointing movie ive ever watched i went in the theaters with high hopes for this since it was the last marvel movie we see until endgame which captain marvel was gonna play a major part i so i wanted to learn more about her too understand endgame but i truly wrong
Apr 28 2019,negative,i went into this movie like i do with the expectations of hero learning and striving to be better and grow as a superhero i didnt get that plus shes incredibly overpowered its so unbalanced i will give props to her costar and especially the cat but it was really meh
Apr 28 2019,negative,poorly executed im a huge marvel universe fan and this was a huge disappointment
Apr 28 2019,negative,this movie is a bunch of none sense its not a bad plot there is no plot brie larson cannot act either and i feel bad for the other actors who had to be in it with her i really hope marvel is nt actually letting her direct
Apr 28 2019,negative,completely destroys the actual character by having bri larson act it out an captain marvel was a man
Apr 28 2019,positive,underrated movie maybe not the best marvel but definitely better than spider man black panther any iron man or hulk and maybe even the 2nd avengers fun to watch and they did a good job with her origins and shield
Apr 28 2019,negative,worst marvel movie ever and terrible actress and script
Apr 28 2019,positive,it was good but they could have made the story a little better especially with nick furrys eye situation 
Apr 28 2019,positive,such an amazing movie loved the story line
Apr 28 2019,negative,i desperately tried to avoid the bad pr around this movie i tried to give it a chance but even samuel l jackson couldnt save this movie the cat was cute the effects were gorgeous but i was bored to tears by the halfway point and to be honest alot of the negative hype was welldeserved the flashbacks were cringe worthy and the dialogue was stilted at best
Apr 28 2019,positive,calm down people there isnt anything wrong with this movie not nearly as bad as most of you claim it to be just okay calm the fuck down
Apr 28 2019,positive,this was a pretty good movie despite all the fear i had going in after trying my best not to get mixed up in the political fight happening outside of the movie overall enjoyed it like all the mcu movies
Apr 28 2019,negative,very disappointing for a marvel movie i just could not connect with any of the characters i wanted desperately to be swept away into the life of another character but the story was weak and there was just no believable motivation for the why  i found captain marvel to be a very one  dimensional and i liked the character less and less the more time she was on screen     if i were to describe the move in one word  flat
Apr 28 2019,positive,strong female superhero  enjoyed
Apr 28 2019,negative,this was a very good movie that i honestly enjoyed watching if it werent for brie larson she was very boring and the whole scene about her blasting her former mentor with her powers compleatly dissagreed with the common marvel concept of not needing your powers to be a good hero this is displayed in countless films and is even the main point of many films like iron man 13 spiderman homecoming black panther and thor ragnarok instead brie larsons arrogant and stoic character displayed the message that one should use ones abilities as a crutch to get things done i have no problem with anyone else in the cast and loved the amazing cgi efects but the first thing i thought of when the movie was over was wow brie larson was horrible in this  i generally like brie larson in her films but i dont think she was the right choice for the lead and it costed marvel a chance to establish a strong female lead now all they have is an arrogant one i hope this review doesnt get taken down like the rest of them
Apr 28 2019,positive,brie larson felt a bit stiff in sone scenes the directors did make a nice attempt at making this an action packed film but they could gave have focused more in the action scenes
Apr 28 2019,negative,it was ok not the worst marvel movie talking about you ironman 3 but not the best either
Apr 28 2019,positive,i loved this movie after not being too impressed by the clicheness of wonder woman but still crying during the first battle scene after finally seeing a female main character kick ass on the field i wasnt trying to get my hopes up but hot damn i loved this movie the chemistry she and samuel l jackson share is infectious and i enjoyed getting to know them through their relationship with each other the soundtrack was incredible her back story was incredible and i play just a girl 100 times in the few days after viewing thanks brie for being a badass irl and onscreen
Apr 28 2019,positive,no matter how much the incel right wants to believe otherwise hating a movie cant stop it from being good
Apr 28 2019,positive,a great story of human empowerment it is not constrained to lifting up a single gender and avoids preaching the movie is quite simply a fun ride and deserves its own time in the spotlight even if overshadowed by the climatic endgame
Apr 28 2019,neutral,visually the film pops and the creative workmanship is this movies saving grace  the script however is the most insipid and banal of plots  most uninspired story line in the mcu brei larson was the wrong fit for the character and so her delivery is flat with nearly every line throughout  the closer to the end you get the more predictable the outcome  i went into it totally behind this newest member of the mcu but leaving i wondered how the character could be killed off
Apr 28 2019,positive,captain marvel serves as a great introduction to a character who will  likely emerge as a crucial player in the mcus next decade  while early on the amnesic vibe of danvers hurts brie larsons performance it was necessary for the development of her character  additionally ben mendolhson and sam jackson are exceptional and the take on the kreeskrull conflict genuinely surprised me in a very good way  an overall solid addition to the mcu
Apr 28 2019,negative,not good had to make myself sit through it very predictable
Apr 28 2019,negative,disappointed in this one was excited to see it but doesnt measure up against other marvel movies  would recommend seeing only to know the character for endgame
Apr 28 2019,negative,following a questionable casting for the protagonist i went in to the cinema with apprehension suffice to say this film has fallen short of the mark we come to expect from marvel studios the plot was flat and monotonous where larson amongst other cast members provided a stoic performance however i recognise that the fictional kree species is very much akin to this  most if not all of the humour that is often intertwined in a russo brothers film throughout was provided by samuel l jackson further from this the film fails to draw much of any emotion from me as i find myself waiting for it to end and pondering how a politically relevant motive can be used to milk the cash cow oh right this is how  overall perhaps this film is a testament to the tried and tested format the russo brothers employ 
Apr 28 2019,negative,brie larsons attitude as captain marvel ruins the compleet experience
Apr 28 2019,positive,great film had lots of twists and turns throughout the movie which kept it exciting right through what a film definitely would recommend to go and see  
Apr 28 2019,negative,it was somewhat entertaining but shes not a very good actress probably the worst marvel movie in the mcu
Apr 28 2019,positive,it was pretty good had a nice twist and the acting was nice id only watch in theaters if youre a big marvel fan though since it wasnt super epic or engaging    brie larsons acting was good but her dialogue was so cringey but my parents thought she was funny so i guess im okay with it    overall not the best movie ive ever seen but its nice
Apr 28 2019,positive,good movie but definitely not one of the better marvel movies regardless of all the advertising hype
Apr 28 2019,negative,sjw trashid give it zero if i could
Apr 28 2019,positive,really the only reason this film is needed is for the back story on captian marvel but it all together is a good movie
Apr 28 2019,negative,a white male who didnt appreciate the racist commentsand the movie is not a big thing its a meh movie wich is better seen in the couch and then move on with your day
Apr 28 2019,positive,slow beginning but makes up for it later
Apr 28 2019,positive,slightly less than mediocre
Apr 28 2019,negative,signed up on rotten tomatoes just so that i can express my disappointment with this movie and anger for wasting both time and money on this     the story has no depth and bries acting was flat and terrible she reminded me an arrogant person looking down on everyone else around her rather than a superhero if you are looking for women empowerment rewatch wonder woman or the 1970s aliens like others have already suggested    this is the first super hero movie where i was secreting wishing that the superhero will lose and vanish so that captain marvel wouldnt appear in end game
Apr 28 2019,negative,zero character development odd story line felt a bit shoehorned in not the worst but could have been 10xs better
Apr 28 2019,positive,great storyline with an excellent cast
Apr 28 2019,positive,i just went and watched this movie and i really liked it then i saw some of the comments on here and i really cant believe what im reading half a star zero stars what on earth were these people watching i know the movie wasnt perfect it was far from it but some of these reviews are just a joke and it is plainly obvious that many of the reviewers dislike brie larson the person not the actor    rotten tomatoes is fast becoming a site for people to use when theyve got an axe to grind rather than give a movie review
Apr 28 2019,positive,did not like how they portrayed the skrulls or nick furycompletely watereddown and essentially depowered they are supposed to be so badass in the comics and nick fury is a total force in every other movie except this one otherwise the movie was ok
Apr 28 2019,positive,i felt like captain marvel couldve been casted a little better this isnt a horrible mcu movie its average at best falls somewhere between thor the dark world and captain america the winter soldier average
Apr 28 2019,negative,ruin nick fury and highly miscast as captain marvelonly ben mendelson was gd
Apr 28 2019,positive,loved it girl power 
Apr 28 2019,neutral,bland just slightly more so than avengers endgame yet that somehow gets a whopping 90
Apr 28 2019,negative,bad story there is very small yet meaningless thriller scenes happened but still not original and feel very cringy  and it kinda look bad   i get it this movie is about the female power nothing more  political reasons
Apr 28 2019,negative,this movie had everything but good acting and a storyline painfully slow throughout even with all the super hero cgi both me and my 12 year old daughter were severely disappointed
Apr 28 2019,positive,i just love the sass d this lady kicks ass takes names and gives no apologies and doesnt have to find herself through a significant other  how refreshing no wonder the misogynistic antisociety little rat packs collectively caught fire 
Apr 28 2019,negative,captain marvel doesnt bring anything new to the table
Apr 28 2019,negative,make or female lead if your main character is smug prideful and unrelatable then its not going to be fun the movie dragged on too 
Apr 28 2019,positive,im so sick of negative nancy debbie downer hateful fanboys this movie though it didnt floor me was a great flick and worthy of its place amongst the rest of the mcu enjoyable thats whats you come to the movies for to enjoy yourself and have fun 
Apr 28 2019,positive,i liked this movie better than end game
Apr 28 2019,positive,i thought it was better than reviews suggested 
Apr 28 2019,positive,continuing the marvel hit strong this movie fits perfectly at the end of this phase and opens the next the storyline is a bit messy at first but it corrects right away full of great action and twists it ties perfectly to whats coming b
Apr 28 2019,negative,a lot of action so thats a plus character development was horrible no personality no struggle no weaknesses no humor very poor attempts no individuality im sure marvel will work out the many kinks they may have to recast the role or give brie larson more freedom to bring make the character her own
Apr 28 2019,neutral,poor choice for lead actressnot sure whos worse larson or the chick from transforners who absolutely cant actfilm was good but could have been so much more marvel cant lose but this one was the poorest of the story arc universeit did not have to be
Apr 28 2019,positive,i dont know why this movie is getting such bad reviews id give it like an 85  
Apr 28 2019,positive,great movie with an empowering message 
Apr 28 2019,positive,looks like the next set of marvel movies are in good hands
Apr 28 2019,positive,unless you hate women you will love this movie 
Apr 28 2019,negative,very mediocre movie plot was lame and foreseeable dialogues were weak especially the performance of the main protagnoist captain marvel aka brie larson the stars of the show were clearly nick fury aka samuel l jackson  yonrogg aka jude law its a shame really big budget and good special effects and the way they made samuel l jackson young again very good the movie could have been a solid superhero action movie with a rating of 5 out of 10 if it wasnt for marvel i expect more i expect to go out of the movie and feel thrill and awesomeness nothing of that sort happened on the contrary i was disappointed
Apr 27 2019,negative,this heaping pile of crap hits every nasty little trope on its way down  to dullsville full of mind numbing ideology and preachy self congratulation captain marvel falls flat brie larson isnt given the chance to do anything but just woodenly stare vapidly in every situation  except for nick fury and the cat who provide some humor this is a joyless foray into how to bury a movie underneath the weight of virtue signalling directors
Apr 27 2019,positive,loved it i dont know what the boo birds are talking about girl power 
Apr 27 2019,negative,captain marvel is one of the most disspointing mcu movies to date brie larson does a horriboe job as captain marvel showing no emotion when delivering her lines the movie is boring unimaginative and a waste of money i do have to give some credit to samuel l jackson as nick fury as he provided some semblance of entertainment in an otherwise bland cgi fest
Apr 27 2019,negative,i dont like the main character
Apr 27 2019,negative,basically poor plot that is almost saved by good actors but the plot holes and hints of sexism nothing super obvious but i kept getting this wired vibe kept me out of it
Apr 27 2019,neutral,it was okay but for some reason just wasnt that into it i dont think they did a good job making captain marvel likable all the other avengers we love and care about pretty quickly whereas if captain marvel died eh who cares the way she gets her powers isnt very grand and then suddenly shes just the most powerful superhero just didnt care much for it some humor but not a lot 
Apr 27 2019,negative,they really did many things wrong with this film captain marvel was not the real star here nick fury is and they even made nick fury a joke with the eye loss by a cat scratch really disappointed its comparable to thor the dark world
Apr 27 2019,negative,boring predictable plot just a cash grab skip this movie and save your money for endgame
Apr 27 2019,neutral,it was alright i think they should have went with a different actress this one just isnt that likable to me
Apr 27 2019,neutral,its obvious the cinematic vision for this film was women empowerment but the over corrected in the end it was just boring and annoying the whole thing was over sensationalized and the main character just ruined it for me she is awful i cant imagine paying to see here in any film ever
Apr 27 2019,negative,disappointing i love all the marvel movies not sure but possibly casting played a roll in it just didnt feel it 
Apr 27 2019,negative,movie was terrible actress was bland wouldnt recommend to watch
Apr 27 2019,negative,you can miss 34 of the movie they try to pull meaningful  moments but dont  hit any and who need any male superheroes you have captain marvel its star wars 8 if you liked that bad movie you will like this bad movie i want my money and time back
Apr 27 2019,positive,a good mix of action drama and comedy based on all of the bad press and internet trolling i expected a train wreck of a movie however i was pleasantly surprised
Apr 27 2019,negative,very disapointed in this movie horrible
Apr 27 2019,negative,the most come question about captain marvel is do i need to see it for endgame
Apr 27 2019,positive,i loved this movie the best movie woo 
Apr 27 2019,positive,so good i loved her humor and how she had to stop letting a man control her and feel her feelings kind of like elsa haha plus kitty 3
Apr 27 2019,positive,even with the heavy handed narrative in the beginning once the story begins to take shape there is fun to be had
Apr 27 2019,positive,this is a super fun movie i dont understand those who are saying is a bad movie 
Apr 27 2019,negative,too political it should be entertaining story but it showed the narrative and the worst side of men not everyone is perfect but seems like there is an agenda to this movie she is an awesome character but they truly made this movie political nick fury is awesome and the new character development
Apr 27 2019,negative,i fell asleep due to brie larsons dull acting performance
Apr 27 2019,negative,the only thing carol danvers had going for her in the comics is that rogue stole her powers and personality i believe the same thing happens to brie she came across as bland and unlikeable worst marvel movie its like electra or hulk bad
Apr 27 2019,positive,this movie was alright the movie tried to be funny but the comedy was kind of so so the plot was pretty great as well and it was entertaining
Apr 27 2019,positive,it was really good im not buying the complaints ive heard 
Apr 27 2019,negative,boring with an annoying lead  made nick furrys eye into a joke
Apr 27 2019,positive,loved it so glad we watched it before end game
Apr 27 2019,positive,wasnt one of the best mcu movies but it is still an enjoyable watch love the pairing of captain marvel and nick fury the story itself was just ok but the chemistry between those two made the film for me
Apr 27 2019,positive,well done origin story for both cm and nick fury  he was great and i really liked her too  she has a good sense of humor
Apr 27 2019,negative,incredibly dull and boring probably one of the most predictable movies ive ever seen the movie should be renamed captain cliche
Apr 27 2019,negative,very unimpressive marvel had a good run
Apr 27 2019,negative,the only funny character in the movie is the cat brie never look like a heroe only a mad teenager
Apr 27 2019,negative,terrible acting and captain marvel is one of the most forced superhero characters ive ever seen
Apr 27 2019,negative,the movie was ok nothing special i mean there was nothing in the movie that made me want to see it again
Apr 27 2019,positive,marvel delivers its first female centric superhero film with captain marvel a prequel to the avengers series  after escaping capture by the skrull a kree soldier named vers gets stranded on earth where she discovers that the skrull are searching for something and during her investigation she unearths a past that she never knew about  brie larson gives a decent performance though shes clearly doing an imitation of a tony starklike character which there are already too many of in the mcu and the supporting cast is pretty strong featuring samuel l jackson jude law and djimon hounsou  unfortunately the script is rather poor as it desperately tries to avoid telling an origin story while also ham fistedly forces one in at the same time  but the actionscenes and fight sequences are fun and exciting and theres some lighthearted comedy that works really well particularly the stan lee cameo  also the soundtrack is incredibly welldone using 90s music to set the tone and time period  despite some flaws captain marvel is yet another solidly entertaining popcorn film from marvel
Apr 27 2019,negative,fell asleep twice during this movie i dont know if its the hero or the actress but the character is not like able
Apr 27 2019,negative,meh we just watched it thinking we had to before endgame nope  want our 2 hours back it was mostly boring please oh please dont make this angry chip on the shoulder character swoop in and save the day that would end this franchise for us
Apr 27 2019,negative,the movie doesnt strive to be anything more than average brie larson lacks the charisma and attitude of a good superhero
Apr 27 2019,positive,very good movie entertaining and action good job marvel and please i donât understand how many people says only bad comments what a lot of hatters and offended fanboys
Apr 27 2019,negative,how many times is rotten tomatos going to delete my reveiw a once trusted site has become a complete joke due to one terrible movie
Apr 27 2019,positive,this movie is awesome it really does resemble the diversity of girls can be stronger  biggerbetter
Apr 27 2019,negative,bad casting bad acting bad script and doesnt belong in the marvel universe 
Apr 27 2019,positive,good not great  i think she will grow on viewers
Apr 27 2019,negative,worst mcu film so far the character of carol danvers has been horribly played by brie larson
Apr 27 2019,positive,i wont pretend to be properly familiar with the comic book version but i have really enjoyed this movie far more than i expected actually
Apr 27 2019,negative,the messaging is heavy handed and offputting enough worse than that was it wasnt even attached to a decent movie the special effects were cartoonish at times especially the scenes in space  the peak action scenes in the movie then the character development scenes were incredibly boring and unoriginal fill in the blanks and whatever one sentence explanation you can conceive for carol danvers background as a character works and is almost certainly more interesting than the movies delivery the acting of the lead actress is on par with a bad high school actor playing a perpetually angry person samuel l jacksons acting was fine but his character nick fury was wrecked in this film buffoonish old cat lady ronin was wrecked shield was wrecked the source material was heavily disrespected logical consistency was a nonfactor the dialogue ranged from empty to cringeworthy the title character isnt even qualified to have the name captain marvel at no point is she even referred to by this name worst of all at no point is the character qualified as heroic she shows no relatable moral conviction or growth its a bad movie and had it hadnt been backed by the same people institutions and money that backed this garbage if critics were honest even if they were fanatically politically aligned with the messaging of this film theyd tell you it was utter garbage any competent person giving this film better than 3 stars is being dishonest even as a matter of taste theres no way this film deserves high ratings only the support of experienced veteran actors make this boring cringefest watchable one time through only respect for the other people i went to the movie with and the rest of the audience kept me from walking out or taking a nap half way through skip it if you havent seen it if you have im sorry you were subjected to this
Apr 27 2019,neutral,a movie that suppsed to be feminist but ended up being stupid
Apr 27 2019,negative,sorry  just not worth the effort to review 
Apr 27 2019,neutral,out of all my mcu film viewings i would rank this somewhere near the middle or lower on the list a decent film but far from the best mcu origin film
Apr 27 2019,negative,the worst marvel movie i have seen in years its like they wanted the hero to be so unlikable
Apr 27 2019,positive,worth seeing but not part of the discussion as far as top marvel movies  does a decent job of establishing the captain marvel character and setting up endgame  larson is outperformed by most if not all of the supporting cast
Apr 27 2019,negative,a mundaine acting on the main character part a transparent attempt at playing empowering women by creating an unbelievable marry sue it just feels fake to the core compared to other mcu female characters and actresses that play them captain marvel is just boring and seems more like a children cartoon i didnt like it
Apr 27 2019,positive,enjoyed captain marvel but also realize some of it is a vignette  of the the times it was set in bieng of that generation i may be a bit biased
Apr 27 2019,positive,was expecting more thank god for the last 15 minutes so we can get a glimpse of what shes made of
Apr 27 2019,negative,she really did a bad job at acting story was meh
Apr 27 2019,positive,awesome and entertaining
Apr 27 2019,positive,an interesting movie with very undisneyish political messages some might not like it but i think it hits a mark
Apr 27 2019,negative,really nice special effects and great tie ins to the mcu but it didnt feel as good as the other marvel movies
Apr 27 2019,negative,the whole movie is just a feminist support campaign
Apr 27 2019,positive,loved this movie ladies kick ass brings a tear to your eye
Apr 27 2019,negative,the worst marvel movie by far actress cannot act ruined the skrulls as they are no longer decent villains to be used apparently just a representation for immigrants by virtue signallers super carol is never in any danger ever and doesnt have to overcome any obstacles and can do anything  very boring cat is soooo stupid naming avengers after her very disrespectful to fans same for nick furys eye forced politics ruined this movie shoiuld recast with a more charismatic actress and leave out the forced virtue signals
Apr 27 2019,negative,plot and dialogue was horrendous 
Apr 27 2019,neutral,very much a summer pop corn movie  some very nice nods to the time period early 90s some nice work by the leads sam jackson larson and law and a few nods to some of the comics  monica rambeau but some very unfaithful to the core comic materials in other elements of the story telling which there were no need to change and actually detract from the story  definitely worth checking out in the theater for the visuals fights and some of the work from the leads but a disjointed storyline keeps it from being more than it could be  forced story telling and forcing plot points seem to be creeping into marvel movies of late  this is another example of what could have been a great move that was just okay
Apr 27 2019,neutral,very different from the original miss marvel and captain marvel a man captain marvel is vastly overpowered just to make her stand out thus making her boring    this film was saved by the cat
Apr 26 2019,negative,everything is good in this movie except actress brie larson   as carol danvers  captain marvel
Apr 26 2019,positive,the movie was well done and i enjoyed the storyline i was unsure about taking my six year old to see the movie thankfully it was not too graphic violent and had very few curse words i was pleasantly surprised and recommend this film
Apr 26 2019,positive,finally for the first time ever marvel made me feel invested in one of their films this is what representation does  it empowers all of us the highest praise to this beautiful film
Apr 26 2019,positive,the reviews from the audience here are so artificial
Apr 26 2019,negative,ok could be better 
Apr 26 2019,positive,the best films produced by marveldisney are not choral but with a single protagonist even with a couple dozen screenwriters their attempt to interlock multiple plots is disastrous yet the moviegoers prefer infinitely more the chaos of a story that seems to pass through a swarm of black holes because by now they understand the epicity as a hypertrophic quantitative bulimia captain marvel was a dip back to the 90s always better late than ever told the beginning of the whole saga had an excellent soundtrack many stereotypes but not as in the 3 hours of avengers endgame with defeat discouragement rebirth of hope a new recruitment heroic deaths interchangeable catchphrases etc  mauro lanari
Apr 26 2019,negative,destroyed my favorite childhood superhero in a few hours  the story was weak
Apr 26 2019,negative,hellboy was better and hellboy wasnt that good dont waste your time here marvel threw this in last minute in preparation for endgame but it fails miserably
Apr 26 2019,positive,this was the lone marvel movie that i went into with low expectationsand i should have never doubted larsen and jackson unlike wonder woman they didnt let the machisma get in the way of the movie 81
Apr 26 2019,neutral,this movie wasnt bad but it wasnt great either it definitely didnt live up to the hype marvel was putting out
Apr 26 2019,positive,loved this movie nice to see strong female superheroes
Apr 26 2019,positive,a decent film that lacks in solid performance and a so so script not the best mcu film but definitely not the worst i expected more of the first female led mcu title
Apr 26 2019,positive,a delightful movie with a great message for everyone especially girls a bit on the modest and mellow side for marvel but i found it entertaining and took a group of young girls who felt like a superhero after 
Apr 26 2019,positive,very good movie entertaining and super fun
Apr 26 2019,positive,great movie perfectly sets up the character for future movies a feminism theme was definitely present but it wasnt shoved down your throat a great addition to the legendary mcu still sad it makes secret invasion almost impossible
Apr 26 2019,positive,good but not a great movie
Apr 26 2019,positive,it was a descent movie but i dont think brie larson was good for the role of captain marvel
Apr 26 2019,negative,absolutely the worst marvel movie yet including movies like spawn and daredevil    brie larson is emotionally flat boring and seems to have no personality other than smug indifference her character isnt much better haha   i know thats petty to say but larson and the director couldnt even seem to separate the two there are scenes in the movie the you should smile more one comes to mind that act as a childish take that to internet trolls way to  devote precious screentime to focus on people that you insist are losers who couldnt get under your skin no matter what    its a shame because i actually very much enjoy the character of carol danvers but she isnt wellrepresented in this film     the cinematography isnt nearly as good as in movies like antman or black panther the soundtrack is subpar the fight choreography feels like every enemy is just halfheartedly throwing a punch or two while they patiently wait for larson to obliterate them the pacing is awful they throw away a potential impactful character moment by having furys eye lost in such a stupid way    larsons character has no weakness so we arent invested when she succeeds in anything even less so than other heroes in movies she never grows as a person her actions just change on a dime she doesnt go off to save the universe because she feels like its her duty to or because she sees that every life matters or even because she wants to destroy anything that would cause great harm  she does things in this movie because the screenwriters demanded it i cannot sympathize with an emotionallyabsent goddess who trumps even the most powerful mcu characters without anything more than a raised eyebrow the dcu has the same problem with superman which is why im disappointed that marvel couldnt see the issue     lets have female characters for our daughters to look up to im all for that lets have them look up to natasha romanoff or gamora women who have done wrong in the past and feel absolutely awful about it but had to work towards expressing their emotions in a healthy way instead of repressing them  lets have them look up to shuri a genius in every regard who doesnt let that stop her from forging a loving natural relationship with her family who doesnt let that stop her from just being a kid without having to take up a stiff mature mantle  lets have them look up to peggy carter who founded shield to bring the avengers together in the first place  lets have them look up to valkyrie storm wasp pepper potts mantis nebula rogue    but captain marvel has nothing young girls even could look up to let alone anything they should
Apr 26 2019,positive,meh i get the distinct feeling marvel is trying to shoehorn captain marvel in to a position of importance for phase 5 or whatever the next batch is  the little twists designed to up her importance actually demean parts of previous movies that were pretty solid and important  for a marvel origin this one doesnt hit nearly the number of right beats the rest of them did
Apr 26 2019,negative,unlikeable main character zero character development and a bad acteress with zero charisma
Apr 26 2019,positive,decent movie but when judged against other mcu movies it us middle of the road
Apr 26 2019,positive,delightful fun and even somewhat logical
Apr 26 2019,positive,honestly i went to this movie with the lowest expectations so many people saying it was going to be too political and that brie larson couldnt act where did they get that from but it was really good and really fun silly marvel movie of course its a work of art or anything but its fun
Apr 26 2019,positive,just like black panther too much hype behind the movie expected more
Apr 26 2019,positive,very cool  i cant wait to see what they do with this character  great start
Apr 26 2019,negative,not worth the hype not at all i fell asleep 
Apr 26 2019,neutral,it was ok it felt emotionally dry especially with past relationships and she felt awkwardly confident for only having 6 years of memory
Apr 26 2019,positive,awesome but her character is so arrogant 
Apr 26 2019,neutral,not really impressed by this one poor execution for marvel and compared with its dc equivalent ww its not good enough a shame i went to the cinema to be impressed and the movie was a big lack buster
Apr 26 2019,positive,in the comic books captain marvel is a guy from trailers to the whole movie it had that vibe of giving power to women
Apr 26 2019,negative,so cringeworthy  i really cant believe this has 78 tomatometer  i would say it was more of a mid or high 40 movie  totally missed the mark
Apr 26 2019,negative,an ok movie not that great if you are a long time mcu fan
Apr 26 2019,negative,over hyped and stale
Apr 26 2019,positive,great movie i enjoyed it a lot and the humour is very good brie plays captain marvel very well though the story telling and unfolding is interesting but in the end it all connects and one would appreciate all the whys being answered this is one of my fave marvel heroes origin stories aside from captain america
Apr 26 2019,neutral,not really feeling this one ben mendelsohn though was a surprising one also larson and jacksons buddy cop relationship is entertaining
Apr 26 2019,neutral,it was okay nothing special worth seeing once maybe again when it comes out on sky or whatever but thats about it
Apr 26 2019,negative,this movie is a shit
Apr 26 2019,negative,only worth seeing for nick fury
Apr 26 2019,positive,while i found captain marvel to be a decent entry into the marvel universe as a woman captain marvel was pure joy  this was not a story of a weak woman who found her strength this is a story of a strong woman who found the best way to channel her strength
Apr 26 2019,positive,the heroine that my childhood needed
Apr 26 2019,positive,good film not a great film   skrulls had potential for much more not just in this movie but the next 10 years of marvel movies   larsons performance was good slightly emotionless at times   story was decent but predictable
Apr 26 2019,negative,captain marvel fails in almost every salient way the title character is completely unlikable because shes an arrogant jerk and the story of how she got her powers isnt compelling all but one attempt at humor in the movie falls completely flat the big twist in the movie isnt even a twist if youve seen guardians of the galaxy or know anything about the kree there is no tension in the movie because captain marvel is totally invincible she really is superman is superman was an unlikable jerk worst marvel movie since the hulk
Apr 26 2019,positive,i thought the movie was decent  there were quite a few pandering feminism rules stereotypical moments i wasnt a huge fan of  the movie had some pretty good humor  jackson was very good as always  larson was ok as captain marvel but they could have cast someone much more charismatic in the role  there is nothing ground breaking in the movie the plot was pretty generic but overall it was a decent popcorn flick
Apr 26 2019,positive,great funny and amazing
Apr 26 2019,neutral,im actually a fan of mcu movies but captain marvel was just okay in my eyes the story is very tough and the 124 game time felt longer than they actually are furthermore brie larson does not play the role in my eyes or play it authentically and she is the main character  captain marvel only samuel l jackson as nick fury and jude law could convince in my opinion and bring a bit of life to the actual movie and to brie larson as captain marvel  gal gadot as a wonderwoman has better convinced than a strong and leading woman in a movie compared to brie larson  i hope kevin feige makes a recast for the role of captain marvel it is supposed to take over the role of a more sympathetic and charismatic woman than brie larson to represent the mcu in the coming years
Apr 26 2019,positive,loved it great action and super storyline for future films
Apr 26 2019,negative,wtf even was this movie
Apr 26 2019,neutral,below average superhero movie
Apr 26 2019,negative,sadly one of the weakest entries in the mcu  while talos nick fury and other characters are perfectly fine brie larsons carol danvers doesnt feel like a real character while the kree tell her that shes too emotional we can barely see any emotions outside of tiny smirks a funny scream and 2 hours of mean strong female character face the movie thinks to do something great by giving us marvels first female leadhero  but seems to completely forget all the awesome women that already exist in the mcu we dont need captain marvel screaming heck yeah women can be heroes too when we already have the likes of scarlet witch black widow gamora or even okoye and mantis that all proved to be a hero in their own ways while still being likable characters the movie itself feels lackluster there is no character development for any of the main cast outside of carols tremendous powerups that destroy any feeling of tension because we already know that carol could end every fight instantly
Apr 26 2019,positive,amazing as empowering as wonder woman great performances by every cast member perfect set up for endgame shame on all the women hating trolls enter the 21st century you misogynists 
Apr 26 2019,positive,while this movie hits all the beats to immerse you in the 90s the character work is not as strong expectations were too high to tackle the backstories to villains and heroes weve previously seen it is less on larson and more on the script of the movie it was a herculean task but ultimately it hits expectations and does not exceed
Apr 26 2019,neutral,at least it was better than black panther
Apr 26 2019,positive,a lot of fun no idea why users rated it low i really enjoyed it
Apr 26 2019,negative,the only interesting characters in this movie were side characters no character progression throughout the entire movie
Apr 26 2019,positive,forgettable and dull
Apr 26 2019,neutral,this movie is good apart from the lead i dont mean the actor i mean the character shes bland and dont have that much character and when she dose its forced
Apr 26 2019,positive,great flick really enjoyed it brie was great
Apr 26 2019,positive,i believe that captain marvel was an ok movie yes there was some parts of the movie where its confusing however overall this movie has the marvel taste
Apr 26 2019,neutral,this movie simply had no conflict for me  i never had any doubt whatsoever that any challenge faced by the hero would be overcome within a matter of minutes    also nothing was a surprise  we were going into her past through memories with her but we already knew her backstory from the trailers  overall really just a dull movie  ill give props to the supporting cast they were all especially great except jude law who was so clearly a villain from his dialogue i wanted to sigh  the visuals were enjoyable and theres potential here just really did not shine through
Apr 26 2019,positive,dont get me wrong the movie is generic no wow moments and omg ones however it is great this is a generic origin story that is told very well if this had come before the super hero craze this movie was hailed because it is made well
Apr 26 2019,negative,worst marvel movie didnt think it could underperforme thor ii
Apr 26 2019,neutral,not bad could be better
Apr 26 2019,neutral,leaves some to be desired in the action department but a nice addition to the mcu
Apr 26 2019,negative,sadly it would have been much better if i hadnt been so bored by the main character whoever she is i hope no one casts her for anything else real talent would have changed this movie dont get me wrong there is real talent in here just not that girl that plays captain marvel
Apr 26 2019,negative,she is just a terrible actor uh i feel dirty after watching this trash 
Apr 26 2019,negative,found the movie slow and not very interesting seen all the marvel movies the last 10 years and this was the first one that i regretted watching should have made a black widow origins movie
Apr 26 2019,negative,captain marvel is about as three dimensional of a character as paper mario but with significantly less charm watch the sometimes hot tempered sometimes confused  assured sometimes sarcastic sometimes sad weird amalgam of all marvel superheroes complete her story arc of going from random space lady to carol in over two hours spend 16 at your local theater to find out what i just told you in 5 minute or less for free skip it save the money female superheroes deserve better than this boo disney boo you can do better i know you can
Apr 26 2019,positive,i am a man and i enjoyed this movie    despite all the crap going on with the actor  i watched it before i saw the media issues
Apr 26 2019,positive,tbh id probably give it a 4 but its audience score is unduly low due to a certain hate campaign targeted at larson because of her openness on political discussion and could you believe comic book men would be sexist never lmao whatever but yeah im a womanboooo and this movie clicked with me more than any previous marvel film her powers being restrained by jude law combined with her history as marginalized pilot give her and the audience ample reason to feel frustrated both seem to be a representation of how women are treated by societyyes even america and i absolutely adored every single minute of that relatability that i have largely found missing in the mcus female characters im so grateful that she along with chadwick boseman will be the mascot for the upcoming years of the mcu i feel largely optimistic for the future of the mcu considering the gorgeous groundwork this and endgame give for her considering how much more compelling every single of her avenger forefathers later films made them rdjs story arc only came into its own post ultron hemsworths character retcon made thor 100x more compelling to follow and evans stoic captain america only became endearing once we realized that he would never back down from a fight im so so excited to see where captain marvel now freed of her metaphorical and literal shackles will go
Apr 26 2019,negative,captain marvel is the most boring marvel character so far
Apr 26 2019,negative,this character should not be in this current version of the mcu she has been shoe horned into the univers i thought this was a terrible movie and they did a disservice to the rest of the mcu and nick fury i will not watch another movie with this character as the lead     bad movie
Apr 26 2019,negative,the beginning of the end for marvel all good things come to an end 
Apr 26 2019,positive,soso movie without packing the usual laughs oohs and ahhs of previous marvel movies marvel did not really show how this girl can defeat thanos
Apr 25 2019,neutral,captain marvel more boring than i expected   1 hr 58 mins   25 mins of action and cgi effects   45 mins trying to tell an origin story  48 mins of speeches
Apr 25 2019,positive,typical mcu movie clearly better than wonder woman and enjoyable overall unfortunately some of the plot is revealed if youve already seen other marvel movies if you havent where have you been for the last decade but i guess thats expected in a prequel
Apr 25 2019,negative,needed more phil also didnt care at all for the main character she never had a redemption moment to humble her snarky attitude this is my least favorite mcu film too bad youll probably need to know who she is for endgame or else id say skip it
Apr 25 2019,neutral,infinity war set the bar this doesnt even come close
Apr 25 2019,positive,its nice movie though for a marvel movie i expected more the action scene is good just for some reason i seem to be not convinced with the character of captain marvel emotion impact is not as high as other marvel movies
Apr 25 2019,negative,bland acting feels like she has no emotions and such a stale face and her views are border line insane
Apr 25 2019,negative,i personally didnt like the movie when i watched it for the first time i thought brie larson looked pretty bored and stuff i get that she is brainwashed and stuff but i saw no good acting in the movie i think she was trying to hard to be a good actor for a big movie that would make a good difference within her acting career
Apr 25 2019,positive,i loved the movie i dont understand all the vitriol out there superb movie and great performances from brie larson samuel jackson jude law and not forgetting the fabulous goose ignore the haters its great
Apr 25 2019,negative,bad overall storytelling  enough with the mary sue characters
Apr 25 2019,negative,worst marvel movie in a while 
Apr 25 2019,negative,not sure what to say about this movie  as far as a mcu movie its similar in appearance  a lot of modern movies are overcgd and this one was no different  the story was mediocre at best and i honestly thought that brie larson didnt really fit the role
Apr 25 2019,positive,solid movie i wanted to love carol but she lacked something i cant put my finger on 
Apr 25 2019,neutral,brie larson in scott pilgrim awesome  brie larson in captain marvel substantially less than awesome  so everything about the movie was good with the exception of  the captain marvel character unfortunately
Apr 25 2019,positive,this is the kind of movie that every single little girl should watch the emotion you a woman have seeing a woman leading a super hero movie i just cant describe
Apr 25 2019,negative,i wanted to like it i just didnt
Apr 25 2019,neutral,well the movie only has a lot of nostalgia and answers for many questions maybe stupids like furys eye after hulk the worst movie in this mcu
Apr 25 2019,neutral,ant man which was one of the least climactic films for the marvel universe just edged out beating this movie in story this gave a little backstory to the character however i felt the plot twist was sub par and of course ronin had no real rolethe added woohoo sound effects were unnecessary and detracted from the ending scenes it was by no means as bad as the dcu movies but far from thor or captain america
Apr 25 2019,positive,for a movie it is mediocre at best for a marvel movie it is pretty disappointing
Apr 25 2019,negative,movie made no sense captain plot device that know what shes needs to when she needs to to move the plot along
Apr 25 2019,positive,dont know what is wrong with the haters solid film for the franchise
Apr 25 2019,negative,entertaining and fun at times but there was a few points where i felt the acting wasnt  up to scratch next minute shes cracking a joke while being serious and next minute its all up in the air     i enjoyed it but i wish there should been more emotions shown in the film
Apr 25 2019,negative,the movie was alright not great but alright i really liked the side characters they really made the movie but captain mavel was just a mary sue that was just there she didnt lead the movie at all the acting of brie larson was really subpar but thats what you get when you hire a rookie actress as was the writing for her character
Apr 25 2019,negative,the only arc in this movie is her power there is zero character development   if this movie featured pokemon captain marvel would be a snorlax
Apr 25 2019,positive,captain marvel is a surprisingly good movie it is good to now the past about mcu but still there is a major problem about cpt marvel this movie cant give captain marvels personality or emotions it should have been an origin story so when we watched this movie and after thinking about what could captain marvel do in situation like this we should give the answer and yet we cant
Apr 25 2019,negative,sam jackson was good brie larson was emotionless cinematography was cut strangely during action scenes cgi looked weird and rushed
Apr 25 2019,negative,zero character development or growth poor service to the skrull overall a very meh and boring flick
Apr 25 2019,positive,i enjoyed it it was a really good movie at face value
Apr 25 2019,negative,the plot is scattered lazily written unsatisfying ending and no direction in directing larsons performance was done well but nothing seemed to click fun movie for when your bored 310
Apr 25 2019,positive,good plot even though the twist was a little predicable brie larson delivered a captain marvel character that is fun and quippy  casting sam l jackson as a younger version of himself was a bold move but it was believable and paid off
Apr 25 2019,positive,captain marvel was an amazing action packed superhero movie it was way better than i ever expected it to be and i would watch it again
Apr 25 2019,negative,absolutely terrible brie larson did a terrible job
Apr 25 2019,negative,okay a little cooler than expected but still bad
Apr 25 2019,negative,this feels like a very lazy film  incredibly predictable plot character development is non existent full of plot holes  and boring script  brie did this film no favours for the character with an emotional range slightly below what id expect from a primary school play
Apr 25 2019,negative,tacky to much of a political agenda miss the classical marvel origin story with this one acting was not good characters werent true to the comics they messed with our marvel in this one  will try to forget this movie as part of my favorite series ever
Apr 25 2019,neutral,not one of marvels best movies but it has its moments but this line heroesnoble warrior heroes its just horrible geez im sure she is a good actress but she just doesnt fit the role i would have liked to see a black widow movie instead
Apr 25 2019,positive,music too loud and not supporting story lots of dialogue unintelligible
Apr 25 2019,neutral,movie making as pure product captain marvel has no inner life of its own a seriously half baked superhero origin and some of the cheapest tackiest lamest universe tieins in marvels history this is the ultimate example of what the studio does worst make join the dots to other movies leaving the individual films with no sense of showmanship or identity a piecemeal tepid feeling the movie comes alive for about half hour when brie larson and a pointlessly digitally deaged sam jackson the man looks exactly the same now as he did 25 years ago why bother team up in a fun buddy movie scenario then it delves into one of the worst examples of marvels over the top computer game cgi smash up finale where everything becomes too weightless and chaotic to care about whats going on it also has one of the weakest scripts from the movies to date even occasionally having awkward dead space where there should be a witty quip there are not one but two instances where sam jackson and some lady react in the exact same wordless dumbfounded way to the reveal of what a cgi alien cat monster can do and once again we have the underwritten villain problem that has plagued the studio iam glad marvel has finally taken the baton from dc and given the superhero lead to a woman one of the few things dc has over them but man i wish it had been a better film than this vanilla nothing of a movie dull cheap looking meandering and poorly paced and brie larson deserves better too
Apr 25 2019,negative,dont waste your money this isnt even worth a dollar rental when it comes out on dvd there was zero character development terrible writing and it wasnt put together very well at all         the story starts out with brie larson waking up on a strange alien planet i say brie larson because they dont make it clear who this character is granted she is supposed to have amnesia amnesia plot lines need to die seriously lazy writing then she wakes up jude law and they fight because she cant sleep ok whatever about 20 minutes in you realize i think theyre all calling her veersâ i guess thats her name i am going to skip ahead because i realize i want to relive this crap movie as little as humanly possible        she crashes on earth and runs into nick fury there are some fun moments with the 2 of them i think if they could have done a lot more of their team up this was one of the better plot points who doesnt want to see more young spy nick fury        they decided to tell this story out of order many movies have done this before but its tricky character development typically happens in the beginning of a story once you know who a character is you can sympathize with them care for them root for them and worry when theyre in peril now that that is established you can get to the action when you start action first who cares if someone gets shot i found myself getting more interested when her story and background unfolded unfortunately it was too late and we were already an hour into the movie this movie has many flaws but if it were told chronologically it would be far better        they put together a great cast and that was about it this was just a bad movie there has been a lot of criticism on lack of humor it isnt like there werent jokes there just werent any good jokes i can honestly think of 1 maybe 2 where i laughed out loud and there were plenty more sprinkled throughout but no one was laughing the third act was really dark not in tone but in lighting this is supposed to be the climax but i cant see anything because someone turned the lights out there was a lot of what i call first draft writing lines ideas and jokes that sound like anyone could think of when your average theater goer can guess what the character is going to say next thats first draft writing        overall this movie felt lazy and rushed and looking back this movie doesnt add anything new it was a placeholder before endgame and it made momeny youre not missing anything if you skip it just watch one of the trailers and youre all caught up
Apr 25 2019,positive,awesome movie with an interesting backstory and carol danvers is simply badass screw the internet trolls
Apr 25 2019,neutral,the plot of the movie just too simple not mcu kinda movie without nick fury this movie will be just flat no fun and humor at all
Apr 25 2019,negative,carol danvers is not in any way a growing charakter in this movie jokes are a main reason why the story telling is not working
Apr 25 2019,positive,this film was entirely a different origins film which i thoroughly enjoyed hopefully you did too
Apr 25 2019,positive,captain marvel introduces a heroine much different than all the others weve seen before she doesnt need a love interest she doesnt need to be nice she is flawed it delivered a lot of comedy and packs a punch in the action department excited for a possible sequel
Apr 25 2019,negative,the effects and all were as astounding as any other marvel movie but the story and choice of actress is terrible all in all its not a movie i would buy or rewatch
Apr 25 2019,negative,probably some of the worst acting ive ever seen the best part of the movie was a cat
Apr 25 2019,neutral,perfectly average superhero movie samuel l jackson nick fury shines in this movie playing off the stoic brie larson carol danverscaptain marvel perfectly engagement falls short whenever captain marvel is alone on the screen unfortunably and despite some genuinely good moments spread throughout the large majority of the movie is unfortunately forgettable  not a masterpiece but worth watching with a friend or two
Apr 25 2019,positive,dont get the low reviews
Apr 25 2019,positive,been reading the comic book for years went back and read the original run from the 70s     some points i want to recognize  the character had her memory wiped multiple times in the books and each time carol was on a journey of self discovery often times sprinkled with pain of loss kelly deconics run being no different for which a large part of the movie was based on     each and every time initially carol was kinda flat an empty shell of rage no she didnt smile much either xd that was the point though as she regained what she lost as her knowledge of self return i watched as carol blossomed into a full gambit of emotions and fullness of character     in the movie the kree are trying to suppress exactly who she is a hot head strong willed a tad impatient and prefers to punch her way out of situations who else does this oversimplified version of the character sound like tony stark without the drinking and the quips its a fair comparison who else though captain america i can hear the groans now but im comparing their stubbornness only really and maybe the punching      so if carol is a psedo copy of stark at least emotionally whats the problem brie larson is a feminist and female comics have been a boys club a long time dont let those opininated women in here to wreck our fun ect theres a singular problem that has been convientently forgotten carol danvers is a feminist to the character is a feminist under jay jonah jameson she was the chief editor of woman magazine its interesting for me to watch the fight in the books come to life in the real world with the same backward arguments she won in the books and i think she will win at the box office as well keep being you brie larson you are the true embodiment of carol
Apr 25 2019,positive,i feel that captain marvel was a good movie not as an action movie but as a good story it answered questions few were asking this is the weakest film i think so far
Apr 25 2019,positive,the movie is good and interesting carol is a nice character and built very well i like brie as cap marvel and she did a great job the truth is that if this movie was an origin story of a male heron there wouldnt be as many bad reviews as there are in the net posted by some aholes higher faster further
Apr 25 2019,negative,i guess they rushed the movie so hard that they forgot to actually put some good plot in it disappointed with the play of the actors and when marvel is going to use actually origin soundtracks syncing hit 9000s songs wont help movie imho
Apr 25 2019,negative,worse than iron man 3
Apr 25 2019,positive,i thought it was a great movie
Apr 25 2019,positive,a must see leading up to avengers end game 
Apr 25 2019,positive,this film despite what a lot of people say is really a lot of fun sadly there are a lot of cliches and the story is a bit boring
Apr 25 2019,negative,i hope this is not the future of marvel
Apr 25 2019,positive,it was a solid movie it had its comicbook references the flerken monica rambeau the most notable among them the acting for carol danvers played by brie larson threw me off a little but yeah solid film
Apr 25 2019,negative,shes a boring character samuel l jackson is the best part of this movie
Apr 24 2019,neutral,i felt like this movie was all rising action and no climax i literally did not realize it was the end of the movie until the credits hit there is no conclusion    they throw away their first antagonists and even their main antagonists like they dont matter and some of what i think was supposed to be empowering comes off as forced    captain marvel is overpowered by the end of the movie which feels completely unearned but theres a scene they set up for a fight in which she cant her powers which would show that she doesnt need them that could have saved it but they throw it away for another empowering message about not needing to prove anything they shove it in your face too    well the movie didnt prove to me that her powers arent totally deus ex machina also it would have been the climax that i feel we didnt really get    also nick fury was poorly used if you look at the plot structure you could remove him and the story would be the same he does nothing important and is only an observer    this movie feel really pointless  like its just another tick on marvels list the main character is unineresting and the plot is weak    most importantly it had lots of potential and it seems to dodge every awesome opportunity it can
Apr 24 2019,negative,no character development basic characters and no shown outlines to what the main character can do just becomes stronger whenever its needed with no explanaition
Apr 24 2019,positive,simply amazing have managed to make marvels first heroine film subtle fun dusty and accessible to everyone simply incredible
Apr 24 2019,negative,lacked  the comedy and wit you usually expect from a marvel movie  felt like a dc movie  i can say its definitely not my favorite marvel movie 
Apr 24 2019,negative,78 positive critic review on this film makes me question the integrity of rotten tomatoes  this film felt like a last minute hack job by an already overwhelmed production studio that decided they needed an origin story  the film gives us a hollow android of a superhero for whom we have no sympathy or emotion  the film adds nothing to the marvel universe
Apr 24 2019,negative,its fun in parts but fails on a whole because shes lacking in character development 
Apr 24 2019,positive,it is good although there isnt really an antagonist love the blockbuster scene though
Apr 24 2019,positive,i enjoyed it though i was confused with the timeline
Apr 24 2019,positive,a good introduction to captain marvel but the cat stole every scene
Apr 24 2019,negative,this movie makes me worried about endgame whats the point of every one if captain marvel can just come in and beat thanos alone
Apr 24 2019,negative,worst movie in the mcu by far the story was predictable and uninteresting brie larsons performance was bland which sucks because say what you will about her as a person she is an excellent actress and she just wasnt an interesting character also this movie draaaaaaags it should be 20 minutes shorter than it is i give this film a star for the stan lee tribute at the beginning as well as the endgame midcredits scene
Apr 24 2019,negative,i went to see the movie without reading any of the reviews im a big fan of marvel comics so i was looking forward to this movie unfortunately despite some good parts to the movie i could not get past what felt like an underlying attack and discriminatory comments about men i almost walked out early into the movie sometimes a movie makes subtle jabs at certain groups but in this case it seemed like an attack on males in general im not sure why it was incorporated into the movie in the way that it was it did not seem to focus on empowering women as it did putting down men     the reason for the one star is that i cannot get past the blatant ness of the attacks therefore the good in the movie has been lost knowing what i know now i would not watch it again i did like brie larson in the role though she seemed great for the part
Apr 24 2019,positive,incredible must watch
Apr 24 2019,positive,marvel studios does it again great story love the 90s throwback a
Apr 24 2019,positive,while i mostly feel just tired and bored with most marvel movies with perhaps the exception of thor ragnarok captain marvel managed to keep me engaged this new cap is fun and it was interesting seeing her story unravel it was fun seeing a less jaded nick fury and visit the 90s brie larson had great chemistry with samuel l jackson and it made me wish for more captain marvel romps through the 90s  sure this is another origin film but it feels fresh in a way marvel hasnt felt in awhile it made me excited about the mcu for the first time in a long time sure i loved tr but i didnt care what came after with captain marvel i really do care about endgame
Apr 24 2019,negative,marvel needs to take a lesson from dc on how to make a strong female lead role if samuel l jackson wasnt in it i would have just turned it off
Apr 24 2019,positive,you all are depressed and delusional if you think this movie is bad it is a great film for those are looking for a great time at the theatre and are a marvel fan my absolute favourite part is the tribute to the great stan the man lee fits in great with the marvel cinematic universe
Apr 24 2019,negative,i didnt find it as interesting or fun to watch as guardians of the galaxy compared to any other marvel movie id put this just above thor 2 just go watch black panther or captain america or any other marvel movie youll be better off
Apr 24 2019,negative,meh does a disservice to women im glad the representation exists but girls deserve a better role model than this there is value in discipline for everyone there was too much pandering to stereotypes that somehow manage to water down the destructive malicious influence that sexism has in society im saying it was half ass it would have worked if they put the whole ass into it alita was a great no compromises girl power story wonder woman was a beautiful display of the unique nobility poise and versatility possible in femininity but im sad to see that the character of carol danvers is reckless infantile and unstable if you cant be a hero without power then you arent a hero with that power and you dont deserve that power either
Apr 24 2019,negative,captain marvel as a movie isnt awful but it is for a marvel movie no character development honestly captain marvel with her bland character and backstory is the main reason the movie doesnt work for me the supporting cast however was pretty good
Apr 24 2019,positive,honestly really good introductory film for marvel much better imo than black panther which i didnt care for definitely worth seeing but im not one of those people that cared what was said off the set good overall film
Apr 24 2019,positive,this movie proves brie larson was the right choice to play captain marvel but also shows that she was a great flop portraying carol danvers
Apr 24 2019,neutral,it was an okay film literally meh it passed the time
Apr 24 2019,negative,decent plot leading to end game but poor acting and cgi
Apr 24 2019,negative,this movie is just boring only the cat is cool
Apr 24 2019,neutral,not a fan of this genre of movies was tolerable but caught myself checking the time quite often out of boredom
Apr 24 2019,positive,a fun time for people of all ages and stunning visual effects the acting is on point not the best marvel movie but definitely not the worst
Apr 24 2019,positive,lots of fun cat was epic
Apr 24 2019,positive,enjoyed the whole film
Apr 24 2019,positive,ok movie but too many cheesy lines 
Apr 24 2019,negative,very bland movie main character doesnt really have that powerful growing moment story was boring actions scenes are few and far in between overall definitely on the bottom of the mcu roster
Apr 24 2019,negative,this whole movie was meh at best
Apr 24 2019,positive,the reall hero is goose
Apr 24 2019,negative,not worthy of a marvel film boring plot holes and bland main character its a nope
Apr 24 2019,positive,i believe that if marvell was played by a guy it would have been better because then carol would have gotten her powers a better way
Apr 24 2019,positive,awesome effects ok movie  mainly watched in order to be up to date before endgame
Apr 24 2019,negative,it lacks conflict and its utterly forced and pretencious
Apr 24 2019,positive,good movie but something was missing but i dont know whatin any event i had fun and i dont need every movie i see to change my lifei liked it so thats a win for me 
Apr 24 2019,negative,samuel l jackson was good larson just didnt do it for me at all
Apr 24 2019,negative,awful worst of the mcu franchise yet film was just plain boring 90s shoved down our throats and brie is ghastly in her performance fabricated plot in how everyone told her she cant do something is just shallow and over played its ironic how entitled the character comes across given the actress playing her
Apr 24 2019,positive,a marvel film focused more on action than character arcs but has solid performances and stunning cgi
Apr 24 2019,positive,completely amazing my absolute favourite marvel cinematic universe movie 1000010 would watch again 10000 times i love captain marvel and goose and ronanall 02 seconds of his screen time enraptured me and aaaauugh i wanna see it again
Apr 24 2019,positive,i have watched this movie a myriad of times and i just cant express how much i love it trailers certainly did not do this movie any favors if you have a daughter granddaughter showing them this movie is a must thank you larson and marvel for giving us young women the kind of ravishing film we have been craving for so long
Apr 24 2019,negative,wooden heroine too overpowered no weaknesses preachy this movie looks to grab the title of worst super hero movie from green lantern are we really sure this is actually a marvel movie
Apr 24 2019,positive,this was an awesome must see movie
Apr 24 2019,negative,i went with high expectations unaware of any of the drama that was surrounding the film but i couldnt agree more brie larson is just boring and impossible to sympathize with i enjoyed samuel l jackson and some other cast members but this is thor 2 level of boredom but this time all can be point due to the miscast of brie larson i presume
Apr 24 2019,positive,dont listen to the haters this is a great movie
Apr 24 2019,positive,seeing a woman superhero kick ass and take names is always a plus in my book i thought it was an awesome movie
Apr 24 2019,positive,upper end of the avengers series  this was very good im possibly biased as anything with ben mendelsohn is generally excellent brie larson as captain marvel was a great choice
Apr 24 2019,negative,boring dialogue tuned out 20 minutes in  it was hard to follow the plot after that point  lame jokes too for a marvel movie
Apr 24 2019,positive,all are wrong is a great movie
Apr 24 2019,positive,amazing movie of brie larson
Apr 24 2019,positive,90 of the people here are most likely insecure men who hate the idea of a movie with a woman as the main character she is 100 the most powerful avenger and this has been possibly my favourite movie of the mcu still waiting on endgame of course you will enjoy this movie if you truly love the mcu
Apr 24 2019,neutral,captain marvel is not a good movie its just an okay movie although brie larson and samuel l jackson did an awesome performance as carol danvers and nick fury respectively the story by itself lacks a lot of what makes marvel stories good  theres not much character development and a moment where you understand why captain marvel is a heroe
Apr 24 2019,positive,a great kicking off point for captain marvel brie larson is great playing the powerful with a certain playfulness and joy the secondary characters could have been developed further the threat from jude laws character never really reached the heights that it could have done but the kreeskrull storyline was good the set pieces were handled well but the film really excelled when brie larson  was just getting on with acting her danversmarvel character the dynamic between larson and samuel l jackson was also nicely handled with a feel of a buddy cop duo from the off and the supporting cast all delivered what they needed to to provide captain marvel with support emotional investment and humour a good start that i am sure the franchise can build on
Apr 24 2019,positive,i cannot understand all the hatred and bad reviews this was a solid mcu addition the pacing was solid and to tiein with the other mcu moviesendgame they did a solid job of character developmentmanagement ignore the haters and basic misogyny seen in poor reviews this is a very solid offering
Apr 24 2019,negative,was the worse marvel movie
Apr 24 2019,positive,the movie itself deserves about 80 ratings on the fan endratings i can understand if long term fans are upset that its nothing like the comics i personally dont care overall movie was great 
Apr 24 2019,neutral,a cliche nothing special movie way overhyped
Apr 24 2019,negative,i was terribly let down by this movie the pacing was off the villain was unclear and shes supposedly in the midst of a war but youd never decipher that within the lack of cast members nick fury saves this movie entirely captain marvels character is so overpowering that it really makes no sense and it makes it almost impossible for her to fit in the mcu they really should have taken their time with this movie it was clearly rushed and the lack of focus tears you away from the plot a hero is only as strong as the villain that rivals them there are no rivals theres no super kick ass fight at the end she glows up and destroys some ships and thats practically all the movie had to offer 
Apr 24 2019,negative,i wanted to like this movie i really did the effects where phenomenal the acting was sub par and the story was awful i normally love marvel but  some how they messed it up related i already said this on a different account but rotten tomatoes deleted my comment so now i have to say it again
Apr 24 2019,positive,i thought it was a fun action movie i didnt know what to expect loved it in every sense
Apr 24 2019,positive,the only reason for my going to see a superhero movie is entertainment  captain marvel delivers precisely that from beginning to end im not going to analyze it im not going to be ensnared in a pointless debate about about a movie based on a comic book captain marvel is fun and i did not regret buying a ticket to see it in a theatre
Apr 24 2019,negative,this movie felt rushed it was like they were in a hurry to get captain marvels story told so people would understand who she is in endgame it might surprise many to know brie larson shot endgame before filming captain marvel
Apr 24 2019,positive,one of the better marvel cinematic movies to exist especially for a solo hereo and one of the few origin stories that isnt the usual marvel cookie cutter story the dialogue between characters isnt stale or obviously trying to move a plot forward but really shines between larson and jackson in its playfulness contrasting humanity wel with the others that exist in the marvel universe and helping build the theme for the movie overall it fit well into an established universe without shovelling exposition towards the audience but at times fell into the old trap of trying to answer questions no one wanted answered making those scenes feel incredibly forced and taking away from what made those things cool in the first place im looking forward to what comes next for brie larsons captain marvel and marvel in general after endgame
Apr 24 2019,neutral,the movie was alright not bad but not good just in the middle there are some good parts in the movie i like but most of the movie felt meh
Apr 24 2019,negative,boring film just to introduce the caracter will not watch enggame because of this crap
Apr 24 2019,positive,much better than i anticipated
Apr 24 2019,positive,it was okay definitely not as bad as people say
Apr 24 2019,negative,am i crazy or was this movie boring compared to the rest of the mcu movies captain marvel does not excite like most other characters no real flare im mad because i had high hopes 
Apr 24 2019,positive,it was an entertaining movie captain marvel shows the typical humor of a marvel cinematic universe movie it is also refreshing to see a mcu movie that has a female lead if you are an avid fan and would love a laidback time after avengers infinity war then this movie is for you but if you are expecting a highstakes actionpacked movie that is geared towards hardcore fight scenes i advice you to think deeply before watching this or not
Apr 24 2019,negative,after some truly fantastic movies in the mcu captain marvel tries and fails at almost everything compared to its bretherin
Apr 24 2019,neutral,meh that describes its best everything about the film is just alright nothing spectacular but nothing bad either there was no moment where there was any real expectation i gave it a 25 rather than at least a 3 because i find it insulting how they treated nick fury and especially how fury  in the movie  came up with the word avengers its an insulting retcon
Apr 24 2019,positive,not as huge as other mcu films but still a brilliant origins story larson kicks ass in it and i cant wait to see what she brings to endgame
Apr 24 2019,negative,not my favorite cheesy and the main character said like 5 words 
Apr 24 2019,positive,captain marvel is similar to a lot of mcu origin movies but the fun cosmic elements mixed with the 90s action movie tone makes for a fun time at the movies the biggest thing it gave me however is an interest in the character and where they will take her next
Apr 24 2019,positive,it was way better than i expected the hate around this movie is crazy 
Apr 24 2019,negative,theres a good movie to be found here but its hidden behind larson samuel jackson ben mendelsohn and lashana lynch were very enjoyable much more so than the main character
Apr 23 2019,positive,we really liked the story of this movie it was quite entertaining 
Apr 23 2019,negative,just bad acting all around and messed up how the avengers got together nick at the end types avenger initiative but he says in avenger one that he put it together because of the plot of thors movie
Apr 23 2019,negative,this movie tries to hard to add captain marvel into the avengers storyline lashana lynch and ben mendelsohn however were awesome
Apr 23 2019,negative,of all the marvel movies made this one was my least favorite 90s nostalgia felt more like pandering and a lifeless sneering leading lady role did not help a disjointed joke of a superhero movie even nick furys mysterious past became a cheap joke i usually leave mcu movies inspired and gushing about comic history this one i felt sad and letdown at least it had a charismatic cat
Apr 23 2019,positive,beautifully done brie is a great actress sam jackson in awesome as always is spectacular i loved the music just a girl by no doubt and id never thought id see a courtney love song featured in a disney movie but here we are
Apr 23 2019,positive,i thought it was really good i dont understand all the hate i went into the movie expecting it to be horrible and kind of hating this character but after watching the movie i really enjoyed it changed my opinion completely
Apr 23 2019,positive,amazing unexpected 
Apr 23 2019,neutral,good but nothing amazing
Apr 23 2019,negative,not as bad as thor the dark world but close
Apr 23 2019,positive,i havent watched many of these but i loved this one it seems like im in the minority 
Apr 23 2019,negative,i hated the tone of making it seem like men put women down i will not be seeing this with my niece as it give her the impression men will try to put her down and make her feel incompetent the movie also seemed kinda off or rushed i did not feel a connect to this film as i did with the last 5 6 movies
Apr 23 2019,negative,didnt like brie larson as the actress for the main character lack in targeting humor and a lot of awkward points in the movie that kept me scratching my head wondering what was going on i wouldnt see a part 2 captain marvel 
Apr 23 2019,negative,all over the place until the climax brought it all together nicely 3 and 12 stars until the end  honestly the ending took it down down down until im at 1 star   spoiler  it was just stupid at the end to be honest she became way overpowered and that completely ruined any potential the story had   like come on  she has no moral code no power limitations no dilemmas that give a hero their heroic quality  the actress did a great job playing the part but the character was not as wellwritten as she couldve been lots of potential wasted  imagine superman without a moral code overpowered notheroic no point in cheering because you know theyll win and its too easy
Apr 23 2019,positive,good introduction for captain marvel
Apr 23 2019,neutral,the movie had a decent plot samuel jackson was fun one of my favorite actors but brie larson wasnt a very good actress 
Apr 23 2019,positive,a confusing and trite opening 15 minutes that is unmistakably trying to be confusing after that this movie soars upon the shoulders of larson jackson and the amazing annette bening unlike other superhero movies ive seen it just builds and builds and builds and really delivers
Apr 23 2019,positive,great movie solid origin story
Apr 23 2019,negative,two stars for the great acting performed by the cat goosesave your time and money worst origin story since i can remember no connection to any of the charactersjust sad
Apr 23 2019,neutral,the plot in this movie seems to be broken by some other narrative the movie seems to be pushing personally it doesnt bother me at all as long as it doesnt affect the plot too much in this case it doesi dont feel a connection to a character whose only hurdle is overcoming her own memory and other than that is too strong for any of the villains within the given play i dont feel a connection to a character whose only hurdle is overcoming her own memory and other than that she is too strong for any of the villains within the given plot finally i like to give an example of how a plot needs a villain that is as strong or stronger than the protagonist the harry potter series has a very interesting plot despite it being used many times and cinema because harry faces int finally i like to give an example of how a plot needs a villain that is as strong or stronger than the protagonist the harry potter series has a very interesting plot despite it being used many times and cinema because harry faces insurmountable odds and tries to win for his friends regardless this is what makes a hero
Apr 23 2019,negative,stop deleting the reviews
Apr 23 2019,negative,as a longtime marvel fan i remember the original green uniformed marvell of the marvel comics who graduated to the marvell of the blue suit     severely disappointed in this story acting and overall tone not what i expected
Apr 23 2019,positive,itâs a very wonderful movie you should see it with other eyes not the haters
Apr 23 2019,negative,what could have been an good movie ended up being a total waste this movie needed better writers and it shows
Apr 23 2019,neutral,definitely not marvels best but not their worst either good humor and performances save an otherwise pretty mediocre movie brie larson gives a good performance but her character arc and development leaves something to be desired
Apr 23 2019,positive,felt compelled to write my first rt review given the unjust 56 popcorn rating this is a good marvel origins flick the bar is set high and quite simply captain m stands up and stacks up brie larson is charismatic and oh so cool you find yourself rooting for her more than most marvel heroes captain marvels humanity is perhaps her most engaging trait one which keeps you fastened by her side as she discovers who she is and what she is fighting for watch without fear 2 hours later you will be yearning for more
Apr 23 2019,negative,what a horrible film boring and brie larsons acting left much to be desired so flat no emotion predictable goose is the only thing that makes the film remotely enjoyable
Apr 23 2019,positive,i quite liked the movie i am happy to see marvel continues to push the envelop with gender and race 
Apr 23 2019,positive,loved it enjoyed every minute
Apr 23 2019,positive,solid however the plot was bleak at times and the lack of more screen time should have been a priority
Apr 23 2019,negative,second worst mcu film iron man 2 wins that title brie larson was a terrible casting decision she lacks presence and any emotional depth in the film the overall plot derails halfway through the film and attempts to throw some curveballs that do not land and lead to a very unsatisfying climax characters are introduced in a way that assumes we have some kind of emotional ties to them with little explanation of why they matter very disappointing movie and to make matters worse brie is slated to lead the mcu moving forward 
Apr 23 2019,negative,couldnt get into it
Apr 23 2019,neutral,the film has a mostly great cast and i really loved the skrulls however brie larsons acting drastically lowered the quality of the movie she seemed to be completely emotionless and her performance left much to be desired think hayden christianson in the star wars prequels
Apr 23 2019,negative,you can skip this one  just another origin story with no real substance its a one time watch def no replay value here
Apr 23 2019,positive,totally underated amazing
Apr 23 2019,negative,while samuel l jackson provides some much needed personality to this film brie larson cant help but feel emotionless and uninteresting throughout the entire experience captain marvel suffers the same way man of steel did the titular character being unforgivably boring and overpowered to the point that the stakes in the film dont matter perhaps larson will bring pack some more punch in the upcoming avengers endgame but as it stands captain marvel as a character is yet another bog standard mary sue stuck in a bog standard origin story my recommendation see this film once for context but only buy it if you are a diehard marvel fan looking for a complete collection
Apr 23 2019,neutral,just ok  too complicated and frenetic 
Apr 23 2019,negative,an inconsistent plot horrible story telling and a political agenda plague this movie down    like many if your watching captain marvel you like super hero movies with this many around its easy to be over saturated by them all so you need to be clever to stand out and be worthy of praise     many of the main story beats do not make sense once the full plot has been revealed there are too many moments where you stop and think to yourself well that doesnt make sense because of such and such    all of carol danvers story arc is explained through secondary characters instead of being shown how she became an ace pilot or how she was an awesome friend were just told this and shoved along     spoilers  i wont go into too much detail about the major issues other than this one as im fearful of the future movies  danvers by the end of the movie basically becomes a god with no real development just other than you go girl she basically becomes an unstable object in terms of writing which is awesome when earned but this is overpowered to the point where she can easily beat thanos like the next movie is just gonna be 5 mins long  i can go into so much more detail if necessary just ask    in summary    this movie is neither clever or worthy of praise i dare say many of the film critics who reviewed this with a positive score were more fearful to be called out by brie larson again they gave it an extra star or two
Apr 23 2019,negative,actress not charismatic att all
Apr 23 2019,positive,i loved it very relatable moments that i think many women  have experienced  her relationship with her bestfriend and the daughter is absolutely beautiful her and nick make a great team the movie has a good balance of serious and humorous moments loved the twist with the skrulls and was heartwarming you could really see how much she changed and found herself throughout the movie cant wait to see carol in endgame my absolute favorite quote from this movie is when carol says i have nothing to prove to you thats something that i can relate to a lot
Apr 23 2019,negative,boring movie its pretty hard to follow do to some pacing issues marvels worst movie by far
Apr 23 2019,positive,this was a good movie i loved the 90s references but also loved that it wasnt too much in your face i knew nothing about captain marvel going into the story so i didnt have the mournful comic moments that some other reviewers have had it was a good movie with a good story i really liked brie larson i thought she did great in the role and her and sam jackson together are always great on screen i really enjoyed the villains in this movie and thought overall it held up against the other marvel films great addition
Apr 23 2019,negative,10 years of buildup ruined in a single movie
Apr 23 2019,positive,really really liked it different kind of origin story which was a nice way to do itnot a perfect movie by any means as more could have been done in the 1st 13rd of the movie developing her and ohter charactersbut the 2nd half kicks serious ass and makes up for the 1st 3rd
Apr 23 2019,positive,a struggle to sit through the cat made the movie   this was a necessary film to lead into avengers end game the movie opened the door to many unknown possibilities that are not properly explained
Apr 23 2019,positive,passable in terms of its quality as a movie but completely fails in the character development department it also tends to retcon certain aspects that theyve built up for years in the other marvel movies not horrible but i would never rush to go see it again still i had a better time watching this than black panther
Apr 23 2019,positive,an interesting concept and a few cool visuals however felt like a chore to watch as it was so dull and prolonged
Apr 23 2019,positive,a very fun film with a lot of twists and definitely helps to get you excited for avengers endgame all of the actors are amazing but goose the cat really steals the show
Apr 23 2019,negative,it was just meh waste of time
Apr 23 2019,positive,had allot of fun would have liked her to get a movie sooner so they would have had a chance to tell more of her story before the end game really recommend it
Apr 23 2019,positive,it was funny action pack and had an interesting message on women condition of being held back by a system i see all the marvels movies with my wife and she just watches them to have a fun activity with me but for captain marvel she had a lot to say on how carols journey resonated with her thanks you guys to give my wife and little girls around the world a hero in their image already powerful brilliant and full of suave
Apr 23 2019,positive,honestly i loved it in general it was a pretty good addition to the infinity saga
Apr 23 2019,negative,horrible pacing boring and preachy
Apr 23 2019,negative,i think that if character is invincible and can not be killed and has no weaknesses there is nothing to see i went and saw it but i think that mcu finished pooring and nothing to root for
Apr 23 2019,positive,good movie i am very young and came into the theater expecting an action packed movie i wasnt expecting an emotional storyline like this i watched it again and respected it for what it is an origin story brie larson and samuel l jackson did a wonderful job providing characters that i care about though it does fall short on action it has emotionally powerful scenes overall a good empowering marvel movie good job
Apr 23 2019,positive,excellent set up film reminiscent the first outting of the big 3 but with more experience barring some noticeable digidoubles and a few unnecessary retcons this is a much watch for any action fan
Apr 23 2019,positive,i was a nice solid superhero movie im not sure why i wasnt more excited by it i know she had character development but maybe there was a lack of character growth i need to watch it again maybe my expectations were too high and i expected more of a wonder woman level story 
Apr 23 2019,positive,yup i loved it my daughters loved it there is nothing to not like must watch
Apr 23 2019,negative,worst mcu film by far the film comes across as very uninteresting and boring brie larson cannot act or smile the feminist led film failed this garbage brings shame upon the mcu it doesnt even hold up or come close to the mcu standard 
Apr 23 2019,positive,not quite at the level of other marvel movies
Apr 23 2019,negative,perhaps one of the most meh films in the mcu no fault to larson as an actress but poor scripting really not looking forward to a sequel unless its a different director
Apr 22 2019,negative,meh hate that there was no arc i found myself actually rooting for the bad guys to at least make it hard on captain marvel but nope i also hate her deadpan delivery through the whole movie also made the sarcastic jokes fall flat i really hope she doesnt ruin endgame 
Apr 22 2019,positive,i loved this movie full stop be sure to see both the midcredit and postcredit scenes
Apr 22 2019,positive,this movie is amazingly done brie larson did a very good job bringing captain marvel to life very epic and very satisfying
Apr 22 2019,positive,it doesnt appeal pretty much any new superheroe genre but rather the opposite even with a female lead
Apr 22 2019,negative,brie has no depth felt surface not a whole lot of character development effects were neat but felt like it could have been more budget seemed a bit low maybe she gets a personality in endgame outside of the film brie does not seem to jive with marvel as an entity or the people in it
Apr 22 2019,negative,it wasnt the worst movie ever but it really wasnt good why is nobody bothered by the faster than light drive they are clearly already going faster than light
Apr 22 2019,positive,brie larson did a fantastic job as captain marvel but the story was filled with lazy writing and huge plot holes this is what happens when marvel gets lazy and tries to squeeze in an extra character at the last minute 
Apr 22 2019,negative,im usually a serious lover of the marvel franchise and i went into this film with an open mind however all of the supposed humor fell flat and every interaction with brie felt like it was forced like she couldnt be bothered to deal with these peasants that needed her help  i am all for women empowerment but this felt less like women empowerment and more like ooh look i am more powerful than you deal with it  to me i believe they should have gotten carols character together in the comics before they decided to make an entire move about her  it could have been much better if they had fleshed out a solid base line for her  you want a movie with a strong female lead  go watch the 1979 alien films or wonderwoman like everyone says  those will probably treat you better than this movie that seems like its only riding on the coattails of modern day social issues and not truly trying to make a statement other than brie larson is a queen
Apr 22 2019,positive,my whole family loves this movie awesome from start to finish
Apr 22 2019,neutral,a mediocre entry into the renowned marvel franchise    the story follows carol danvers as she becomes one of the universes most powerful heroes when earth is caught in the middle of a galactic war between two alien races set in the 1990s captain marvel is an allnew adventure from a previously unseen period in the history of the marvel cinematic universe    looks theres a lot of unnecessary hate on this film i remember the initial trailer being ridiculed online by fans although i stayed unfazed when it came to the release people were saying wow what a terrible film thats fine however they said its terrible because of the woman lead brie larson etc they werent disliking it for the right reasons in my opinion my problems with this film lie completely out of that    first off i think brie larson is a fantastic actress shes done so many good things but for some reason i dont feel like her performance as captain marvel is very natural i dont know if thats due to the fact that theres a lot of writers who touched this screenplay the duel directors or other reasons but i didnt buy her as the marvel that could also be due to the fact that the character itself was never really consistent in her attitude or her goals nothing against larson neccesarily because shes proven to be a great actress but i wasnt feeling it     the visual effects were actually pretty damn good in this film i mean its a marvel film with a high budget and they take time to flesh out these visuals but it looked great the deaging was the most impressive thing to me as you really couldnt tell that they did that in post production     the story itself is what fell apart for me i wasnt really invested in this story and while it had an interesting concept with a great twist it felt very empty there wasnt an emotional weight to this character and again it just felt like the film was all over the place i mean granted this film isnt bad but its just mediocre in my opinion     in the end i thought captain marvel was just eh its not bad and im hoping to see her character develop a bit more in the newest avengers it releases in 3 days im so excited but in the end you can probably skip this film
Apr 22 2019,negative,the movie is slow boring and doesnt have any memorial scene  brie larson doesnt interpretate a good captain marvel and despite this being an important movie forma the mcu its not a good movie
Apr 22 2019,negative,the kree were silly and for a race organized by a galactic super ai made terrible decisions as every turn nothing they did had any logic or reason to it    i thought the acting was decent and the chemistry between larson and jackson was great they were let down by the writing rather than weaving a tale where capt marvel was deceived by the kree and tricked into working with them they just gave her amnesia we dont actually know much about her character other than being antigenocide  she didnt have serious moral dilemascharacter failures to grow and endear her to the audience  her growth was just slowly piecing things together and then oh  i totes remember now  the kree are bad guys
Apr 22 2019,negative,very meh thnere is about 9 minutes of this movie that are actually enjoyable too bad not all together if i had to do it again i would save my money and watch thor dark world again thor 2 is sadly better than this pile of shite
Apr 22 2019,neutral,i liked everything in the movie except captain marvel the movies protagonist i found her quite annoying through the majority of the except the end of the movie the character didnt grow she was basically flawless and that leads to an unrelatable character that the audience cant attach to i founde the skrull to be a much better character we see his motivations what drives him to do what he does we can connect to him besides its flaws i still found the movie entertaining
Apr 22 2019,positive,pretty good story and acting from superb cast cant wait for sequel
Apr 22 2019,neutral,enjoyed everything but the smugness
Apr 22 2019,positive,not the worst  but no credibility for a captain marvel ii
Apr 22 2019,neutral,kinda liked the story but brie does not convinced me at all she tries to be funny but clearly does not have humor i do not believe this is the strongest avenger like is being claimed  they should of had chosen another actress to fit this role there are so many more actresses that could of had performed better  this is my honest opinion i do love the franchise and i hope they could improve and decide to name another character the leader as i do not know how would i feel having her as leader nothing against women is more the person
Apr 22 2019,positive,loved it my favourite marvel character finally has her own movie
Apr 22 2019,negative,terrible movie try again marvel 
Apr 22 2019,negative,boring forgettable thank you next 
Apr 22 2019,positive,a couple of moments in the movie were a bit onthenose but overall one of the upperechelon of mcu movies additionally cptmarvel is my 5yo sons favorite avenger now
Apr 22 2019,negative,garbage very jumpy brie larson had a lackluster performance she doesnt have the charisma to carry a film she might be okay in the avengers end game film i honestly wanted my money back still excited for end game though definitely wouldnt waste my time watching this just watch or read the plot highlights somewhere id give it a c
Apr 22 2019,negative,huge mcu fan ive enjoyed most of the marvel movies i cant wait for the avengers endgame i am hoping that captian marvel does good in the show     review    1 captian marvel felt way to politically driven for a comic book movie  2 brie olsens acting was poor my personal view is nothing against her she is a great actress just the wrong person for the role of captian marvel i heard a rumor that shailene woodley was potentially going to star as cm after watching the movie i wish they had reconsidered     3 often times through the film youll cringe dont believe me go watch it
Apr 22 2019,positive,captain plot hole    i like brie larson even if she comes across as condescending in interviews and speeches but the problem was the structuring of this movie there are just points that dont make sense and the whole thing reminds me of a typical modern hollywood film no real dedication to the narrative and character development i really like that they utilized the female version of this comic book hero the problem was they just didnt develop the character of carol danvers better and give the actress more time to make the role hers off script kind of seems like they didnt trust the actress to fully step into the role its a shame because this is one of the lowest audience reviewed mcu films to date i am looking forward to seeing what will happen to this character under a director who can use her better while i am concerned because she seems too overpowered at the end thanos will undoubtedly have something to countermand her level cant wait to see how this changes the team dynamic
Apr 22 2019,negative,i hope they can do better in the next film captain marvel has potential to be a great addition to the marvel universe captain marvel needs some humanity
Apr 22 2019,negative,boring and just a waste of time
Apr 22 2019,negative,it dod not add anything to the mcu she has always been a b character i am hoping she will not be in endgame and if she is i hope it will only a few minutes i am a hige comic book fan and i was very disappointed the movie was a bomb and i would like a refund
Apr 22 2019,positive,went to this movie with low expectations i was not disappointed the friendship between vers and fury seemed so forced the best parts of the movie all included the skrulls and their reactions to goose
Apr 22 2019,positive,its the equivalent of playing a video game that gets too hard half way through so youre forced to turn on god mode
Apr 22 2019,negative,the writers really didnt give us a hero to care about thin backstory stiff and no gravitas in the lead character or yon rogg thank goodness for sam jackson annette benning and ben mendelsohn
Apr 22 2019,positive,honestly it wasnt a bad movie now remember that i said that because im going to go over this movie with a comb okay so this movie starts of okay but nothing really happened and it was a bunch of oh whats this and oh whats that it often times felt extremely boring so much so that i had to go to this movie 3 times before i even remembered what happened at the beginning but the film does this thing were the main character has amnesia but it just doesnt really work with this movie because it honestly didnt affect this movie that movie that much at all okay another thing youll forget about is this weird little thing on the map characters neck that i guess hold all her powers back but it really felt like she could d all the same stuff once it was off so that felt a little pointless oh and i have no idea why the skulls were good guys it not a bad change it really does change these kind of boring characters into a bit more of a interesting type of species but we dont really get much from them so again not really huge at all also the main character has absolutely no emotion at all and it is really bothersome and annoying when the main character has nothing to offer emotionally i can tell you right now the only part youll really like about this film is nick fury he is honestly the only reason this movie is three and a half stars every thing else in this movie was either way to bland like the sub characters or way to emotionless like the main character one last thing alien cat is the best thing ever and i need a figure of it immediately
Apr 22 2019,negative,overall a  really dull movie i expect more from a franchise as big as marvel the story was bland and poorly linked plotholes were present throughout and danvers had no real character arc she learns no lesson and doesnt grow at all shes a cheeky and annoying brat at the start and a cheeky and annoying brat who doesnt need to prove herself to anyone in the end there are so many small ways this could have been improved but nobody seemed to care they concerned themselves more on the politics of this movie thats why wonder woman and alita were leagues better this movie is just there its supposed to be the introduction to a mighty female hero who will be vital in dealing with thanos but they somehow messed it up disappointing really
Apr 22 2019,negative,its ok not really bad but just forgettable
Apr 22 2019,positive,hreat movie just dont spoil any other movies next time
Apr 22 2019,negative,the film may be about women breaking their shackles but the lead actress feels kept in check for much of the picture humor winds up being provided by samuel jacksons nick fury
Apr 22 2019,neutral,standard marvel fare jacksons performance was enjoyable didnt leave me hyped or mad i left underenthused
Apr 22 2019,negative,thin plot amature fight scenes boring special effects wooden acting with no one to care about saw only because of endgame coming up capt marvel prom mises to play a big part in saving the avengers and after seeing this movie that isnt a good thing
Apr 22 2019,positive,an exciting funny and often quite poignant marvel movie reminded me a lot of marvels phase 1 films i have a strong feeling that carol danvers will be one of endgames mvps
Apr 22 2019,negative,the lead was terrible it tries to subvert expectation so much that it does what no one wanted waisting great characters and its just plain boaring what a  show and now were stuck with it i feel like the pitch for this movie and what the draw for the audience was ment to be is purely the fact that its a female led superhero movie for the mcu talk about filling the roll in the worst way possible im all for female superheros but im not gonna pretend this movie was good just so marvel can say they have a good female lead movie was vanilla at best the only reason i wont give it a 0 is because samuel l jackson is so endearing
Apr 22 2019,negative,horrible bad direction and bad protagonist
Apr 22 2019,positive,i love how they mixed old tradition with new concept made the movie better than most i have seen this past year
Apr 22 2019,neutral,captain marvel reveals the mcus current most powerful superhero with a film from the inverse but functional process  by removing the same political crap that has negatively shrouded the film through a butt marketing campaign captain marvel is a cute film but nothing more than others
Apr 22 2019,positive,i thought the brie larson was kind of wooden my favorite parts were with the skrulls who were entertaining but there were too many convenient plot points overall it is a must see as a marvel fan but i cant picture the need to see it a second time
Apr 22 2019,negative,bad acting poor cgi
Apr 22 2019,negative,the movie raised more questions than answers for me there were so many things presented in this movie that were counterintuitive to the mcu in its build up to now i was amazed how her powers went to an astounding level so quickly and effortlessly i guess marvel knows what theyre doing i had to watch this because i didnt want  to miss something i needed to know for endgame
Apr 22 2019,neutral,it was ok it was great to see colson and fury sadly captin marvel was very drab no personallity and no developement i was not expecting it to just be ok being a marvel movie sadly it did not follow the comic history of the characters it really could have been written better
Apr 22 2019,negative,bad casting bad screenplay bad direction   overall single worst movie in mcu  personally wasnt all that interested in captain marvel as a character   this movies origin story didnt add anything  if it werent in the mcu i would not go see this movie  i considered it homework to get through prior to endgame
Apr 22 2019,negative,deviated from the real to much for me
Apr 22 2019,positive,dont miss if youre planning to see endgame we really enjoyed this movie
Apr 21 2019,negative,packed with action bad humor visual thrills and not much else  captain marvel attempts to introduce the mcus greatest hero without developing her backstory or character whilst poorly using a resemblance of the franchises signature formula as a crutch to avoid any real character arcs this poorly written movie prevents actors and actresses from giving us what could have been a truly unique experience choosing instead to poorly alliterate a political message this aside upon my own first viewing i only sighed 5 times that is five more times than any other movie ive seen without giving second thought to the plot characters message or franchise as a whole  this movie was actually relatively enjoyable and even managed to make me chuckle quite a few times however the more i think about the plot and each character in this movie the more i realize that this is quite possibly the most poorly written big title movie ive seen to date the apparent abandonment of any kind of growth for the main character comes across to me as a catastrophe witch is funny because the two best things about this movie were the cat and the skrull character whose name i dont even remember this movie could have been much better in different hands even with the same cast were it a better movie my love for the mcu would never have been tainted if you dont think about anything this movie is okay  about a 3 maybe 35  but if you think about the plot characters any of the other movies or simply unprejudiced logic i unfortunately have to give this movie a 1 the worst part is that this movie makes me not want to see more of the character that is captain marvel it breaks my heart because i truly believe that brie larson could do a decent maybe great job if she was handed the correct material lord knows she did the best with the script laid before her i hope the russo brothers are able to salvage her character enough to keep the franchise from tipping
Apr 21 2019,positive,its watchable character seems to be disconnected
Apr 21 2019,negative,ruins a lot of what is special in the mcu while giving us a hilariously overpowered character that i didnt care for in the slightest
Apr 21 2019,positive,while there are definitely some entertaining moments in captain marvel the film overall feels flat and rehearsed with a cobbledtogether storyline the filmmakers really try to make you care about whats going on by shoehorning in a connection to the mcu but it was difficult to emotionally connect to the plot and characters its not a bad movie it just doesnt bring anything really new to the table
Apr 21 2019,positive,a solid movie not great but pretty good
Apr 21 2019,negative,bad story bad actress
Apr 21 2019,positive,haters gonna hate but this movie is great i thoroughly enjoyed this ferkin film  carol fits nicely into the character family within the mcu and captain marvel is a welcome addition to the cavalcade of heroes
Apr 21 2019,positive,i thought captain marvel was another fantastic marvel movie a must see before endgame
Apr 21 2019,negative,nothing interesting in the movie
Apr 21 2019,positive,a good marvel story i liked the way it explained some early marvel history and fit in with the avengers and the tv series bree larson is very good as the lead character and now she seems like the most powerful character of the whole marvel universe even ahead of thor great set up for avengersend game 
Apr 21 2019,negative,average movie where the antagonist and supporting roles outshined the star of the film
Apr 21 2019,negative,this is a nick fury movie brie is a horrible actor
Apr 21 2019,negative,an interesting concept but captain marvel looks bored the entire movie and wasnt very interesting the best part of the movie about captain marvel was nick fury
Apr 21 2019,positive,pretty good but huge box office is more down to a triumph of marketing particularly in telation to the near releade of endgame
Apr 21 2019,positive,it was a very good movie to see with your parents it keeps the kids engaged and shows that a woman can do anything a man can but it was missing one last thing
Apr 21 2019,positive,people gonna hate for no reason i thought it was an exceptionally strong marvel movie with a strong female lead and the cat was awesome
Apr 21 2019,positive,i enjoyed this more than i thought it would  great cameos and the buddy comedy with samuel l jackson and brie larson is fun  totally worth the price of admission
Apr 21 2019,negative,i didnt like it it was so boring the movie is all over the place no cool fights and no real emotional connection to the audience nothing compared to wonder woman im glad female leads are starting to happen though about time
Apr 21 2019,negative,omg this movie was dead on arrival how can the critics be so blind brie larson was incredibly dull the jokes were moronic and the messages were soooo simplistic really bad
Apr 21 2019,neutral,i get that shes a female super hero but shes just way too overpowered i mean cmon on her first day with the powers she can just fly through a massive spaceship and cut it in half i dont care if shes a female or not thats just fucking lazy she has little character development either the only dynamic change to her character is her finding out that shes from earth other than that theres nothing she starts the movie with her powers and ends the movie still with her powers the movie is a badly written edited and directed superhero flick i hope theyre not setting up captain marvel to be the one to defeat thanos because then whats the point of 10 years of character development for stark cap thor etc just for her to come in out of nowhere and defeat him ugh also horrible move with how fury loses his eye these writers and editors really should never work for another mcu film or series
Apr 21 2019,negative,i never doubted marvel in my life for when it comes to movies that it would be goodbut now it is safe to say that they have failed with this joyless mess in the past 11 years seeing a marvel movie was a great experience that was until this pos hit the screens hopefully rotten tomatoes wont nuke our reviews again
Apr 21 2019,positive,as far a sh movies go much better story and awareness than 90 fanboys are dusted ha ha
Apr 21 2019,positive,an amazing movie and character addition to the mcu regardless of what butt hurt fanboys rate it at  captain marvelbrie larson is possibly the last and greatest chance the marvel heroes will have at defeating thanos in this coming movie version of the final battle endgame  this movie is an excellent origin story of exactly how captain marvel gains her possibly limitless powers and very nicely links characters weve encountered before from other movies ronin played by lee pace makes a surprising cameo and gives us hints to why he eventually becomes the character that the guardians eventually deal with and defeat  other beloved characters are also present from earlierlater time frame films which also give us little hints at the growing complexity of character entanglements and just how some of these characters are all tied together in the mcu  larsons character is an amazing character to me in terms of positive role models for young girls to look up to and before i get flamed by some fanboy or whoever yes i know she is fictional but the heartmoving and emotional portrayal of determination to never give up even if you get knocked down and just because you are a girl doesnt mean that you dont have strength the simple fact that she keeps getting up is a lesson all young women should see and pay attention to  being a father to an amazing daughter i want no need my daughter to see that so she knows that not all superheroes are guys girls can kick ass just as much as guys and in captain marvels situation she can kick ass even more  i highly recommend this movie and if you have a daughter you need to take her to see it  peace out and nuff said
Apr 21 2019,negative,complete trash terrible movie all the way around
Apr 21 2019,neutral,enjoyed the movie i could see the feminine undertones but if you go into this for the mcu story then its fine mind the girl power and enjoy
Apr 21 2019,negative,worst script and bad stunts and the most worst casting ever in marvel cinematic universe
Apr 21 2019,positive,its good not to great the plot is a bit ehh the puns  jokes could have been delivered better but overall it have some ok avarge marval action
Apr 21 2019,neutral,not a bad effort but the character just came off as smug arrogant and not very likable the skrulls were more comical than menacing and the banter usually fell flat
Apr 21 2019,positive,dont let the basement dwelling misogynists slew of one star ratings fool you this movie was exceptional its funny well written and perfectly cast brie larson was amazing though goose really stole the show 
Apr 21 2019,negative,definitely the weakest of the marvel movies thus far i was expecting the drama surrounding the feminist messaging to be overblown and not that big of a deal but the political messaging in this was so obvious that it really did harm the movie making it much less enjoyable brie larson did a terrible job first marvel casting that felt like the person was playing a role instead of being the character 
Apr 21 2019,positive,im reading all these reviews and i have to say i dont agree with half the poo thats being said this wasnt the best marvel movie with the bad jewish jokes but instead took a good approach to raise awareness with the struggles that women go through the idea that women have to prove themselves to men on the daily the idea that women are to emotional therefore is a sign of weakness please watch this movie with your daughters so they can see a glimpse of what most women deal with in a mans world the idea of getting knocked down your whole life and finding the courage to get back up that is the message people
Apr 21 2019,negative,i feel asleep during this movie that just how mediocre it is not only is it predictable and boring but it also has many continuity errors for the mcu within it
Apr 21 2019,positive,a great cast and a story filled to the brim with relevant metaphors captain marvel is a competent action movie with more layers than i was expecting
Apr 20 2019,positive,one of my favorites honestly awesome 
Apr 20 2019,positive,was it the best marvel movie ever heck no but it was still a very entertaining movie sure it was an origin story but it didnt have the cut and paste feel that doctor strange had 
Apr 20 2019,positive,i had been really looking forward to this movie and all the hype it was being given it was about time marvel gave us a female super hero but i was left feeling a bit disappointed  carol danvers herself made me mad in a way her attitude seemed a bit pretentious and wasnt really what i had been hoping for ever since i was a little girl watching the cartoon avengers assemble i loved and looked up to the female super heroes i thought and still do that black widow was the coolest chick now this includes gamora and nebula who i love the female heroes in both marvel and dc movies where always people i looked up to and wanted to be like but with captain marvel i didnt really get that vibe yes she is insanely strong and independent but in some of the interactions she just seemed to talk down to those around her and that just rubbed me the wrong way and really made it hard for me to connect and relate to her in the same way i did with other female heroes     another issue i had with the film was that it contradicted a lot of things that had been said in previous marvel films such as nick fury referring to shield as shield when in iron man they had yet to shorten their name until the end of the movie and the fact that if i am not mistaken in thor and the avengers coulson makes it seem as though thor and loki where the first interactions with aliens they had but this movie directly contradicts that   things like this made it seem as though the movie wasnt as well thought out in my opinion it made it seem as though they where tying to really force the idea that captain marvel was very very important     that being said i did in fact enjoy quite a bit of the story fury was hilarious along with the skrull leader they where the funniestbest parts of the film for me along with goose the cat i liked the references to guardians of the galaxy with ronan before he goes rouge   i believe captain marvel could have been a great movie but for me i felt as though it was bordering just okay
Apr 20 2019,positive,great movie lots of comedy and action 
Apr 20 2019,positive,good movie wouldve liked a little more background on the characters and history of the people 
Apr 20 2019,negative,just watched this so i could get caught up for endgame waste of my time remember in high school english class where they taught us over and over again never tell me how they feel show me as a reader well maybe the writers need to take basic english class again stop being so emotional you need to control your emotions what emotions brie larson was a robot i had to be force fed that she is emotional that she had a rough life growing up that she had this close relationship on earth horrible story telling fury colson and talos were great 
Apr 20 2019,positive,captain marvel was a great movie it is definitely in my top 5 marvel movies
Apr 20 2019,negative,this is by far the worst super hero movie to have come out since man of steel and batman v superman the plot made no sense the character is broken and the fact they had to bend over backwards to fit her into the mcu and messed up some of the carefully constructed over racking plot is disgusting it was a real shame i really wanted to like this movie because i liked carol danvers back when i was reading comic books every week in college hopefully they will fix her in end game and any other movies moving forward
Apr 20 2019,positive,good movie i thought it was a little underwhelming because after infinity war this was the next marvel movie i would wait until you can rent it to watch it but it still was a good movie to see in the theater
Apr 20 2019,positive,it was okay story line wasnt very exciting cinematography was great larson was an okay cast for this role 
Apr 20 2019,negative,this movie isnt horrible but it wasnt great  to me mainly it was due to bries acting  her acting seemed to be just that acting  i didnt get the sense that she was this character  also the cute bantering she kept doing throughout the movie just never landed   not a bad movie but with the hype the movie was given i was disappointed
Apr 20 2019,negative,the visual effects are as always for a marvel movie great i want to forget this movie exist for the mare fact that it retcons key elements on the entire mcu i actually wish this movie was dusted off by thanos bad script bad acting and a sad turn for the mcu
Apr 20 2019,positive,i liked this very much 
Apr 20 2019,negative,no evolution of the character and op
Apr 20 2019,negative,the main character is portrayed in such a way that makes dislike her and this intentional but not planned out well because it makes the big plot twist not as surprising and there is very little struggle in the film
Apr 20 2019,negative,hard to care when they dont struggle against much
Apr 20 2019,negative,about as fun as getting a door slammed in your face
Apr 20 2019,positive,not a fan of some comments brie larson made but come on captain marvel is a solid film in the mcu series somwwhere in the middle of the pack but definitely not rotten like the skewed audience vote suggests
Apr 20 2019,positive,another marvel movie success very entertaining
Apr 20 2019,negative,not bad but feels kind of flat
Apr 20 2019,negative,one of the worst marvel movies i ever seen started out decent then turned in to a lifetime movie in middle backstory was painfully boring i fell asleep at one point im shocked this movie is certified fresh and think thats because negative reviews are being purged and pc reviews by pros who wont admit it sucks
Apr 20 2019,negative,its simply a bad movie and totally unnecessary character to shoehorn into endgame
Apr 20 2019,negative,bad casting terrible story telling and shame on you rottentomatoes for removing that 50000 audience reviews
Apr 20 2019,positive,satisfying origin story well acted paced and very entertaining
Apr 20 2019,negative,this movie was terrible all the scenes that had brie larson dialog were awful    as a big budget mcu movie the action scenes and cgi or decent but story and plot are horrible    the villain in this movie is terribly developed who even is the villain in this movie the skrulls turn out to be victims jude law gets knocked out with a single punch ronan has his entire fleet wiped out in  an instant so i guess it was the supreme intelligence the humor falls flat mainly due to bries terrible delivery all of the retcons to make carol danvers the most important character in the mcu is insulting to anyone that has been invested in the mcu for the last 10 years
Apr 20 2019,positive,not the best not the worst in the marvel lineup brie larson pulls of a good super hero and is very likeable sam jackson is always entertaining although the deaging process was a bit unreal to me the pacing was a little bit off and the humor could be better balanced still captain marvel feels a bit by the numbers albeit still very entertaining if this movie was released before the bar was set by iron man i would probably rate it higher
Apr 20 2019,positive,not bad at all  not the best marvel movie in the mcu but far from the worst  my biggest problem is id like to know more about caroland i understand she has the amnesia angle but she also has the problem thor had in his first 2 movies  powerful but poorly defined in how and largely 1 dimensional  i like where theyre going with it  i loved her misadventures with nick fury and the backstory on shield  i really liked what they did with the kree and the skrulls  id definitely watch another tale of hers but id love for her second movie to be like thors third in terms of quality mcu has less excuse for story growing pains the more they do this and the better they get at it  shes powerful shes badass she doesnt have to prove a damn thing to you and youll be entertained like a movie is supposed to do  watch it and i think youll have a good time
Apr 20 2019,negative,terrible acting by brie 
Apr 20 2019,negative,not a great entry into the mcu  its about as good as thor 2 the dark world  some of the fight scenes were good but the flying action scenes looked as artificial and weightless as superman fighting zod in man of steel  some of the source music in the film is like a bucket of ice water that breaks your immersion  musically they were going for something funartisticlly cohesive like gaurdians of the galaxy but with a 90s alternative rock vibe instead they achieved something similar to suicide squads habit of playing of a song because the director thinks its cool  still if youre a fan of the mcu id recommend you watch it if only so you can say you watched all the marvel movies  however if youre unfamiliar with the mcu this is probably not the film you want to start with
Apr 20 2019,negative,bored the whole movie would have rather watched golf
Apr 20 2019,negative,i feel like the star of this movie brie larson wasnt very good in the role kinda ruined the whole movie for me
Apr 20 2019,negative,the move is below average
Apr 20 2019,negative,overrated forced jokes stupid acting same expressions bad direction boring
Apr 20 2019,negative,feeled like a forced movie into the marvel saga
Apr 20 2019,positive,its perfect
Apr 20 2019,positive,such a great movie its great to see a female lead without a romantic storyline yes its a superhero movie and yes it nods a lot to the 90s but its still a lot fun 
Apr 20 2019,positive,i liked it a lot but could have been better if they had less explaining to do
Apr 20 2019,positive,loved every minute 
Apr 20 2019,positive,good movie enjoyed the not in your face feminist arcs like in the new star wars movies the lead actress was great and slj was a great younger version of himself not scared by the events of the future the exposed political intrigue was a good touch of realism and added more depth to the marvel universe not everything is as black and white cant wait for more 
Apr 19 2019,negative,worst marvel movie ever she just gets strong doesnt do anything doesnt even get to suffer or sacrifice for the win or power
Apr 19 2019,negative,pretty disappointing really heavy handed the memory device was neat but no chemistry between characters too much attention toward laughs and not enough on characters physicality
Apr 19 2019,positive,good action scenes but some dull moments overall not bad 
Apr 19 2019,positive,very interesting movie kind of slow in the beginning but it got a lot better when nick fury showed up it really tied together
Apr 19 2019,neutral,good special effects but the story was confusing and hard to follow at times not marvels best work
Apr 19 2019,neutral,decent movie not up to marvels usual standards in my opinion still we enjoyed it 
Apr 19 2019,neutral,highly predictable as one might expect with no real attempt to lift it toward the other standalone films in the mcu some fairly interesting characterisation of cpt marvel but it is matched with some bizarre choices too meh
Apr 19 2019,positive,i enjoyed this up until the ending where it just became cliche as fck    the heroes stoicism keeps the movie strong and on point  after all she is exmilitary  current alien army or we    even the supposed villain has character finally stories with more depth    but the ending just becomes dumb when she gets ultrapowerful and knows how to use all of her powers instantly  cliche
Apr 19 2019,positive,enjoyed it loved the twist and humor in it great movie
Apr 19 2019,positive,it was entertaining 
Apr 19 2019,negative,the movie was really not that great it was kind of cheesy and comedy didnt seem as good as many others the cgi was ok i guess
Apr 19 2019,neutral,film was average at best title says ms marvel but i felt like it was nick fury part 1
Apr 19 2019,negative,i found the film to be mediocre at best captain marvel herself felt very emotionless which is funny considering how often they tell her she is too emotional and the whole plot is filled with so many holes and contrived conveniences that i couldnt get immersed at all i am not looking forward to seeing her in endgame
Apr 19 2019,positive,this film does a great job of tying together some loose ends of the mcu and establishing where captain marvel has been in the 20 year gap between this film and infinity war very interested to see how captain marvel ties into the plot of endgame
Apr 19 2019,positive,pretty good need the actor to wear jeans more
Apr 19 2019,positive,great movieloved to see whats next in this amazing mcu movie franchise
Apr 19 2019,positive,the movie is a great one as far as origin stories go i see many reasons why incels and white supremacists are spraying saliva claiming its a crap movie but in 2019 theyre the crap of our society 
Apr 19 2019,neutral,its not an abomination like some say but its the most mediocre marvel movie since the last one
Apr 19 2019,negative,the movie wasnt horrible but the lead didnt really stand out larson is bland and emotionless she lacks any motivation to be a hero and doesnt fit well with other heroes
Apr 19 2019,negative,the only reason why this movie did as well as it did was because it was attached to the mcu and right before avengers endgame
Apr 19 2019,positive,this is one of the top origin stories marvel has produced wonderful action and humor throughout would highly recommend for all to see
Apr 19 2019,negative,cheesy and convoluted
Apr 19 2019,positive,absolutely loved it
Apr 19 2019,negative,this film is awful script is cringy and boring plot is nonsensical performances are uninspired at best and most of all it introduces so many inconsistencies into the mcu for no reason at all other than lazy writing or making poor jokes i really dont understand why this happened black widow should have gotten a movie instead  a character already connected to everything we know with a ton of backstory potential this film is a complete waste of time and money
Apr 19 2019,positive,i liked the movie but i have a slight bias against it due to the fact it differs a lot from the comics in terms of powers origins and other things
Apr 19 2019,positive,though this movie doesnt particularly stand out from any other mcu movie it holds its own an produces another interesting story to the universe
Apr 19 2019,positive,while the storyline may be simple in comparison to other origin stories the movie is aided by great casting and lovable characters its also refreshing to finally get a marvel female lead especially with the wit and strength of larson
Apr 19 2019,positive,a very fun and entertaining movie which features great visuals and action in addition to a surprising performance from ben mendlesohn but it lacks a solid character arc for its main hero
Apr 19 2019,positive,although it does not doing anything to hype me up for endgame it does set up a good story with great action and sets up captain marvel in a fun way
Apr 19 2019,positive,not the strongest marvel film but a good introduction to a character that surely gives the avengers a good chance of kicking thanos bum in endgame
Apr 19 2019,negative,i was very disappointed in this movie probably my least favorite marvel movie
Apr 19 2019,positive,it was just an average movie and its quite disappointing i felt as captain marvel was to over powered also the only time i really did smile was win captain marvel and fury were chatting thanks rest was kinda bland
Apr 19 2019,positive,captain marvel was ok not great a decent popcorn flick really the balance of serious and humor seemed forced to me my impression of bries performance was of an actor playing a superhero which hurt my ability to immerse in the story in fact the supporting cast really saved the film for me the star of the show for me was the cat funny how a for legged creature gets the best laugh in the whole movie
Apr 19 2019,positive,actually quite good i enjoyed watching the movie i like its tone and setting
Apr 19 2019,positive,good marvel  funny entertainer and with lot of action cant wait to see the next one
Apr 19 2019,positive,great movie we all loved it
Apr 19 2019,positive,great movie strong start and stands on its own would recommend watching the other marvel movies to get all the tie inn 
Apr 18 2019,positive,captain marvel is a fun superhero film nick fury and goose the cat are the best part of the film the hero is a superman where they feel invincible which makes relating to her hard and a bit cheesy as she tells herself how great she is the story is all over the place with many backflashes this is not one of marvels best but is still a bit of fun 710
Apr 18 2019,positive,was something supposed to happen in this movie i love phil coulson and 90s references but those alone cant sustain a 2hour film
Apr 18 2019,negative,poorly directed weak acting trite story  not up to par with mcu standards at all
Apr 18 2019,positive,literally one of the best marvel movies i have seen dont listen to other peoples bad comments its amazing the plot the story characters acting all awesome cant wait for endgame
Apr 18 2019,positive,i really liked this one fun and nostalgic  made me excited for endgame
Apr 18 2019,negative,it is so full of itself that it doesnt even really fit in with the avenger universe nothing marvelous about it
Apr 18 2019,negative,very disappointing carol never developed throughout the story and she barely struggled at all the tribute to stan lee in the beginning was the only part of this movie that i cared about he deserved better than this movie for the first marvel movie with a female lead it wasnt good as a female myself i dont get anyones hype around this painfully mediocre marvel movie if you want a female superhero to look up to go watch the wonder woman movie which is hundreds of times better a point to dc
Apr 18 2019,negative,spoilers carol had no character development she is just powerful because she has power from one of the stonesthere is no one in the movie that poses a threat to her she just blast everyone around and drags law through the dirt like a cuck the movie cant go 5 minutes with out some reference of feminism as that is exactly what this movie is a feminism movie the only redeemable part of this film is the skrull such a great casting but at the same time they ruined the kreeskrull war elements of the comics the skrull are just refugees to help meet the check list for a feminist flick happy shazam blew this out of the water
Apr 18 2019,positive,talk about girlpower no wonder why she is currently mcus most powerful character to date     im glad that the 90s era was chosen for the story it gives audiences a nostalgic feeling of how it was back then im ecstatic as well how her origin story was developed this is a far cry from her comic origin    my advice go see it now and just like any mcu movie wait until the end for a treat
Apr 18 2019,positive,kinda slow and boring 
Apr 18 2019,negative,this movie is a spit in the face to anyone whos enjoyed the mcu
Apr 18 2019,negative,the movie was predictable and to be honest just a plain yawn fest predictable poorly cast dont watch it
Apr 18 2019,negative,characters  were boring and forgettable   cinematography  had one good shot and the rest of the film was basic  nick fury  made as a joke unintelligent and pointless  captain marvel  no tension felt for her as she is overpowered and emotionless and learns nothing throughout this film and is still the same arrogant character  writing  the writing was dreadful and missed emotional opportunities to really make us feel for the characters it felt like a child written it  brie larson  the wrong person casted as this character shes a good actor dont get me wrong but she wasnt the correct person for the job but she did well with what she was given  i had such high hopes for when i first heard about this movie but the character being basically invincible was boring and i learned nothing new from this film as an mcu film it also brought nothing new to the table it didnt feel like its own movie it felt like a mix between guardians of the galaxy and thor ragnarok
Apr 18 2019,negative,the worst marvel movie since the second thor  im giving it this low score to out weight the sjws i hope endgame is good
Apr 18 2019,negative,it was awful it doesnt know what it wants to be it constantly goes from serious to funny to weird and you expect it to reach an epic end fight but end up with a terrible half baked fight
Apr 18 2019,positive,it was even better than most of the mcu movies like hulk thor 1 and 2 iron man 2 and 3
Apr 18 2019,positive,this is a great movie i had to be persuaded to watch it bc i believed the bad ratings of the audience now that ive seen it i can only imagine that white chauvinist xenophobes were the haters bc this movie challenges all those tropes and it does so super well
Apr 18 2019,negative,non of good acting and you get 5 millions and it is the biggest sum which any of marvel actor had earned for solo film got this should i become a feminist and propagate it for money
Apr 18 2019,positive,it was better than i thought it was a good movie
Apr 18 2019,positive,decent film overall actors performances are lack luster at times but the film is overall pretty decent and well made
Apr 18 2019,neutral,they wanted to give captain marvel a grand opening and failed
Apr 18 2019,positive,one of my favorite marvel movies so far
Apr 18 2019,negative,is not what i expected give a new origin to the character does not seem right i think its just a movie to fill a gap in the saga that leaves a bitter taste i see it very difficult to see a second
Apr 18 2019,neutral,my least favorite of the marvel movies so far maybe tied with the third iron man i think they were trying to do something with her personality but she either couldnt pull it off or it wasnt written clearly enough the supporting cast was really good and saved this from completely sucking
Apr 18 2019,negative,worst mcu film since hulk
Apr 18 2019,negative,not up to marvel standards didnt help with infinity wars not worth watching 
Apr 18 2019,negative,probably the weakest marvel movie brie larson was rigid and uninspiring her character also figures out instantaneously how to use her power and knowing what all it can be applied to no character development no remorse for wrongful actions captain marvell as a superhero is also super boring like the superman of the marvel universe invincible can fly shoots beams of energy that cant be stopped only difference is superman does have two things that stop him kryptonite and his character can feel   supporting cast and characters were a little interesting captain marvels best friend was probably the most interesting character but not much connection was felt and little back story was shown about her  would only recommend this if you want to see a little of furys origin and why suddenly the avengers have superwoman on their team to fight thanos
Apr 18 2019,positive,not a bad movie by any estimate i think it suffers because marvel has hit so many home runs lately and this was more of a double i was sold a ground breaking black panther type experience  and purchased something closer to the standard marvel origin films  it reminded me a lot both good and bad of the first thor movie and like thor i think its going to take marvel a few movies to get this character right brie larson an amnesia origin story certainly doesnt help develop a reliable personality or build a character i know and like
Apr 18 2019,negative,one of the worst films in the mcu so far
Apr 18 2019,negative,the cat was amazing as advertised i really hoped this movie would be better than what is saw in the trailers but sadly my trust was misplaced  by now i rewatched most marvel movies several times but this one has little to no rewatchability
Apr 18 2019,negative,feminist agenda comic book movie  with too many special effects that try to paper over the cracks  of the female leads acting one of the worst comic book movies that i have seen
Apr 18 2019,negative,im disappointed its all i can say and im trying desperately not to sound mean there was no chemistry between the actress and the character it almost did not seem like a marvel movie the whole girlwoman power theme was repetitive and overplayed wonder woman was so much more enjoyable than this movie i felt uncomfortable giving a 12 star because even that is generous sorry but this film left a bad taste in my mouth as end game approaches i hope her character doesnt wreck marvels most highly anticipated movie 
Apr 18 2019,positive,captain marvel was great funny and captivating personally it was very action packed i would watch it over and over again that is how much i love and how great the movie was
Apr 17 2019,negative,super boring seriously its not about the story the art of film the character of captain marvel its about feminism
Apr 17 2019,negative,meh it feels forced into mcu
Apr 17 2019,negative,worst marvel movie ever thats what happens when politics gets into films 
Apr 17 2019,positive,not the best marvel has done but definitely watchable
Apr 17 2019,negative,i didnt enjoy this movie the only reason i sat through it was because its related to end game brie larsons character was not robotic it was subhuman the awkward way she responds to everything doesnt reflect a soldier or an alien its how the mad hatter would act in our world everyone else in the movie was awesome she was sooo flat
Apr 17 2019,positive,i thought it was very good at the beginning it was confusing but it made sense later on i also liked how it tied up some stuff in the marvel world for example how fury lost his eye there were a few parts where it got a bit weird and cheesy but overall it was great
Apr 17 2019,positive,fun action movie world building seamed a bit forced or to coincidental
Apr 17 2019,negative,a horrific turn for the marvel community
Apr 17 2019,positive,captain marvel very 100 avengers endgame 
Apr 17 2019,negative,i think that choosing this girl as the protagonist is completely wrong which seriously affects the definition of the hero
Apr 17 2019,positive,excellent movie i listen to dumb ass critics who are really kinda stupid cause this crushef it
Apr 17 2019,positive,i think the part that sucks is when the cat scars nick it makes nick not look like a badass like in the other movies but thats the only reason why i give it 4 stars
Apr 17 2019,neutral,painfully average 510
Apr 17 2019,positive,great movie and i dont care that its getting all this hate because of a women lead its a great movie and ppl should understand that
Apr 17 2019,negative,the worst marvel movie ive ever watched
Apr 17 2019,positive,the best movie i have ever seen  
Apr 17 2019,negative,way to ruin a movie  waited for everything to settle out  figured it was somewhere in the middle  what a waste  clearly disney dunk a lot of money into propping the ratings
Apr 17 2019,neutral,this is filled with so many cliches you could turn it into a drinking game both the beginning and ending are super cheesy and nonsensical but the middle is solid if only this movie wasnt rushed it would have been so much better
Apr 17 2019,positive,captain marvel exceed my expectations brie larson did a much better job than expected or what was portrayed through initial trailers and some outside sources the movie was entertaining but nothing special 
Apr 17 2019,positive,meh is really about the best way to describe it i just cant bring myself to dislike a marvel movie otherwise id probably agree that captain marvel is pointless and not entertaining of all the marvel movies this is the one ive felt most like id already seen before because all it does is recycle old mcu material meh
Apr 17 2019,negative,captain marvel directly apes off some of the best elements from guardians of the galaxy and avengers but fails in trying to package all previous exposition into an upuntilnow unheard of characters origin story so late into an already established series while it may have the pageantry and weight of all the previous installments this actually serves detrimental to captain marvel as it leads her plight to come off as unearned and vapid
Apr 17 2019,positive,loved the movie   learning the back story of furey  the avengers great cat i want to see it again
Apr 17 2019,positive,such a good movie with a great twisttale on a pretty fantastic comic book series
Apr 17 2019,negative,when the protag goes i was fighting with one hand tied behind my back and then flies through a spaceship your like what sort of antagonist will challenge her and then you see the only chance of a fight run away a complete disappointment and by far the weakest in the marvel series heres hopping end game will be better
Apr 17 2019,negative,cinematics were phenomenal in my opinion but the movie itself just didnt live up to the hype no comic relief like other marvel movies and just kinda bland all around
Apr 17 2019,negative,disclaimer i watched after all the hate movement that this movie had on premier a week before endgame    its a green lanthern movie ripoff they could do so much with this character using the comics as an inspiration but its the same narrative a green lanthern they didnt even try to bring something new and brie larson doesnt make any justice to carol danvers not the worst of the mcu movies but a mediocre one
Apr 17 2019,positive,superb brie larson nails this performance well done
Apr 17 2019,positive,captain marvel is a fantastic prequel and fits perfectly into the timeline it is a fun joyous film with good humour
Apr 17 2019,negative,the movie is mildly entertaining with the biggest drawback being that the main character is just not believable she gives an underwhelming performance if you enjoy the marvel movies you pretty much have to see it just dont get your hopes too high
Apr 17 2019,negative,as a lover of comic books i was quite disappointed with this movie this is because the liberties taken with changing the source material in this case the cpt marvel comics were enough to make the character and universe completely different sometimes that change can be good like in the newer batman films and sometimes its just a deal breaker    sfx and sound track was ok but nothing great same goes for just about everything else
Apr 17 2019,positive,anything with goose was awesome
Apr 17 2019,negative,worst marvel movie ever terrible cast and thrown together save your movie and wait for cable
Apr 17 2019,negative,worse marvel movie ever cast was terrible and movie was poor thrown together
Apr 17 2019,positive,better than what i thought going in just doesnt live up to its mcu counterparts
Apr 17 2019,negative,so called the best marvel studios movie ever dont make me laugh altough visually stunning the film fails to connect with audiences doing so by having a completely unlikable main character and dumb plot twists that make the villains look pathetic and boring not to mention the male characters in the movie who are in the next level of dumbness
Apr 17 2019,negative,thankfully not significant to the infinity saga if this is the  new direction of marvel then end game will be my last mcu movie
Apr 17 2019,negative,i went to see this film ignoring what has been in the media etc this is the first marvel film which thoroughly disappointed me the humor was cringe worthy and the retcon they did with a few things was just plain stupid nobody was a major fan of captain marvel especially this depiction disappointed marvel and if she is going to be the leader of the team in phase 4 things for the future arent looking good
Apr 17 2019,negative,there are many reasons this movie sucked first they it had an incoherent plot and inconsistent flow to the movie second they were more pc feminism then making a likable female character third they had to toss the political commentary of poor helpless refugees into the story if you didnt notice they then found them a separate home to live on instead of invading earth in addition they turned a frightening villain race  the skrulls and turned them into helpless victims so liberal of the writers next the whole cat scratched furys eye is how he lost his eye was plain and simple bad writing it was a huge let down lastly the movie was dull  and boring worst of all the mcu movies worst then thor 2 which is hard to beat
Apr 17 2019,negative,i dont know if it is the writing directing or acting that is to blame but captain marvel doesnt  come across as likable or something you cheer for sure some fight scenes are bad ass but so are the ones by thanos and he is definitely not the one to cheer for the best moments are at the rambeaus where there is actually a little emotion and sense of meaning sam jackson is always entertaining but not even jude law is convincing and appears just overly stereotype overall in the bottom 23 of the mcu and not really worth the time
Apr 17 2019,positive,amazing film nice to know her origin
Apr 17 2019,negative,was expecting something better
Apr 17 2019,negative,marvels olive branch to feminists a slap in the face to stan lee a sad attempt to be progressive terrible script apparently skrulls come from australia the avengers shouldnt have any trouble with thanos now that they have another person with seemingly unlimited power who cant be touched i also noticed it wasnt filmed in georgia probably because its a prolife state marvel shot themselves in the heart when they decided to approve this nonsense way to open the door for dc
Apr 17 2019,neutral,in my opinion the same level of a movie as thor the dark world so the worse movie in mcu i have even fell asleep a little and wasnt bothered by talking people in the audience if this is a new mcu that were going to be served in upcoming years im going to have to say no thank you
Apr 17 2019,positive,i very much enjoyed the way they payed this out and had fun seeing it there are some major issues with it from a comic readers point of view if you dont read comic and have just seen all the mcu movies then youll love it and if your old enough to remember the 90s the nostalgia is great 
Apr 17 2019,positive,decent movie dont agree with her being the most powerful hero but still good 
Apr 17 2019,neutral,a decent movie but its one of the mcus weaker effort the script is all over the place and it tries to hard to fit in with the rest of the mcu
Apr 17 2019,positive,eh its just really generic nothing is bad or good entertaining for sure but bottom of the barrel for the mcu and not really worth another viewing brie did the job it just wasnt enough
Apr 17 2019,positive,while just a bridge to avengers endgame captain marvel is as entertaining as flawed
Apr 16 2019,positive,its the kind of quality youd expect from marvel but still feels fresh and exciting in a saturated market
Apr 16 2019,positive,a bit long at times a little too much with the jokes but still an awesome movie
Apr 16 2019,negative,so it isnt bad but it isnt good either it was just kind of boring and anticlimactic i wasnt considered about our heroin winning or losing it was all a foregone conclusion i did like the twist and who was actally bad and who was good but unfortunately it wasnt enough and what was up with fury he just came off like a dorky sidekick he wasnt the badass we have seen before and it wasnt like he was a wet behind the years agent he had been a military colonel a spy during the cold war and a current high level shield agent it wasnt the big feminist movie that i was afraid of or political like black panther but it just seemed like a movie that didnt really matter 
Apr 16 2019,negative,i walked out of the movie a little over an hour into it this is the worst marvel movie by far if i dont care about the main character after an hour it is very hard to continue watching the movie because i feel im just wasting my time there needed to be character development earlier on rather than just a bunch of fighting and special effects i just sat there wondering why i should care what i saw was lazy and just felt like a made for tv movie if im being completely honest
Apr 16 2019,negative,rubbish and the skrulls deserved better than this crap
Apr 16 2019,positive,thoroughly enjoyable addition to the mcu
Apr 16 2019,positive,the movie was a decent marvel film and it fits into the story well but the twist was mainly used to keep you interested in the movie but rewatching the film knowing the twist it wasnt just thrown in there overall i liked the movie but the agenda behind the movie is what ruined the film for me
Apr 16 2019,neutral,0 character development unlikable character doesnt expand the mcu in a meaningful way
Apr 16 2019,negative,a largely underwhelming movie luckily it had the marvel name to back it up with all the controversy surrounding this movie and with the comments coming from brie larson the only good thing i can see from this is watching the character die in endgame at the hands of thanos
Apr 16 2019,neutral,its a movie not sure what else to say it has a few nice moments in between exposition not bad not great it just felt like a movie that they rushed out in order to premier before endgame captain marvel had a lot of potential but it feels like themes got trampled partway through in order to set up endgame
Apr 16 2019,positive,very good but it didnt have that marvel feeling  810anton r skovborg
Apr 16 2019,negative,what a waste of time
Apr 16 2019,positive,love the movie powerful action and made me laugh gotta love the marvel formula
Apr 16 2019,positive,the first of the avengers 
Apr 16 2019,negative,this movie was disappointing and a bit too generic to call it something new theres no character development and little to no struggle from the main character
Apr 16 2019,negative,larson comes across as smug and completely boring in this movie making samuel jackson funny in this also comes across as a mistake watch only if its free
Apr 16 2019,negative,the main character and hero is hard to relate to as she is perfect at everything when she first tries it   dispite this i was still enjoying the story put i was taken back to reality whenever they shoehorned a feminist agenda in  samuel l jackson is incredible and it is great to have more backstory on nick fury  bree larson does a poor job and is kind of like a machine reading the lines
Apr 16 2019,positive,was a lot better than people were claiming
Apr 16 2019,neutral,not a very marvel movie   poor nick fury
Apr 16 2019,negative,without cat fury and scrulls this movie would be called captain poker face
Apr 16 2019,negative,this movie was disappointing i love marvel movies but not this one the casting was terrible especially the lead actress fury saved the movie from boredom
Apr 16 2019,negative,boring only the last bit is interesting
Apr 16 2019,positive,amazing movie cant wait for the avengers
Apr 16 2019,negative,it was very blah boring kinda middle of the road samuel l jackson and goose stole the show
Apr 16 2019,negative,its hard to comprehend the emotions and character development for brie larson i honestly tried to give this movie a chance to get better but it just didnt do well for me   the only reason im giving this a 1 12 star is because of jude laws  awesome performance
Apr 16 2019,positive,okay so this is coming from a womans perspective i didnt like how certain aspects of carol were erased that were in the comics def some times they were trying too hard to be a femnist icon movie that being said it was enjoyable just didnt live up to my expectations for a captain marvel movie but hey you cant win em all at least wonder woman was amazing  those saying shes too overpowered clearly didnt read any of the comics she is overpowered in the comics too   wouldve been a better ending if shed touched that guys head god why cant i remember his name for the love of god and he remembered that he too had had amnesia and had lived a life before kree   again enjoyable jus doesnt live up to what i expect from a marvel movie still like brie as an actress she def put in a lot of hours into physically training for this
Apr 16 2019,positive,going to give this five stars to combat all the negative reviews this was a good movie the characters came alive fought for something and left the audience excited for the next chapter it brought life to the fury character and introduced a vulnerable flawed female version of captain america despite the critics i rate this one in the top ten of marvel universe movies excited for the next one
Apr 16 2019,negative,you can see problems in the script  when the costar or a cat steal more camera than the protagonist
Apr 16 2019,positive,another marvel movie which has got the elements to sail past as a feasible one for the next setting not the greatest but it has its endearing bits worth a watch with endgame coming
Apr 15 2019,negative,expected much more of this movie poor acting boring and lack of heroness from start to end
Apr 15 2019,negative,my wife and i had high hopes very lame easter eggs if you can even call them that bad acting overall meh of a movie
Apr 15 2019,positive,it was good enough to introduce captain marvel i enjoy it
Apr 15 2019,positive,a great movie i thoroughly enjoyed it
Apr 15 2019,positive,marvel studios captain marvel does what every marvel feature has done before recycled its storytelling formula with little originality to offer     although the feature does lack some plot originality it is still full of entertaining action and a rather impressive cgi deaging technique on jackson and greggs characters of fury and coulson respectively     personally i believe this movie is about 23 years late larsons titular character should have been introduced much earlier in the mcu in one way  introduce her in a small cameo appearance in another movie like guardians of the galaxy 2 a la black panther and spiderman in captain america civil war then in the following year present the captain marvel movie alas here we are     fun but forgettable its just another day another comic book movie
Apr 15 2019,negative,marvel failed horrible shots tone and purpose
Apr 15 2019,positive,wasnt in a rush to see this one with all the press surrounding it  brie larson is great the movie is funny especially for someone like me who graduated high school the year its based inbest stan lee cameo and i loved the action  some good plot twists too  i wasnt sure how id feel about captain marvel joining the avengers since im so attached to the cast of already established characters  however after seeing the movie im sure shell be a great addition  really fun night at the movies
Apr 15 2019,negative,i really tried to hang in there with this one it has like thor 2 level boring banter and no good twists to redeem it brie larson isntbad but she really isnt right for the role as everyone else has been saying the supporting cast was solid but im going to break from the crowd by saying that i thought the effects looked really bad in this film
Apr 15 2019,positive,its okay typical origin story nick fury and the skrulls stand out everything else is meh captain marvel could use a bit more personality
Apr 15 2019,negative,very boring for the most part acting was poor at best i wanted to like it but it was a total bust in my eyes over hyped film
Apr 15 2019,positive,good entertaining but marvel seems to be running out of stories to tell 
Apr 15 2019,positive,strong character development and an excellent performance from larson cant wait to see her in endgame 
Apr 15 2019,positive,great movie enjoyed everything about it 
Apr 15 2019,negative,it was just boring not a snooze fest but its all been done before and bries acting was sleep worthy
Apr 15 2019,positive,i enjoyed this film not even close to a top marvel movie tho
Apr 15 2019,negative,captain marvel is an exciting idea executed in a boringly predictable way
Apr 15 2019,neutral,it waseh if it wasnt for the cat and samuel l jackson it would have been extremely dry the acting was lackluster for the genre and title
Apr 15 2019,positive,this movie is amazing my heart soared watching this its all of the breaking free of chains and smashing glass ceilings and recognition i cried tears streamed down my face from an emotion no movie has ever elicited before empowerment
Apr 15 2019,positive,great to finally have a female superhero get her own movie in the mcu but weve seen this plot before
Apr 15 2019,neutral,decent action great special effects actually gave the heroine a struggle to overcome not preachy  butless than what i expect from marvel   carol danvers vs princess diana ill take wonder woman everytime much better character
Apr 15 2019,positive,i have seen it in imax twice in 3d and once standard tomorrow i go back and see it for 5th time i havent gone to see a movie this often in theaters since lord of the rings
Apr 15 2019,negative,not worth watching really hoping captain marvel character doesnt ruin end game
Apr 15 2019,positive,loved it outstanding job
Apr 15 2019,negative,most disappointing mcu movie to date she brought no life to her character and the story was sloppy wonder woman was far better and that was a dc movie
Apr 15 2019,negative,movie fails to give a proper message and acts as if its something bigger than it really is the action is just generic the agenda being pushed is also very in your face also it annoys me because the movie wont accept its obvious loss to shazam by filling up my nearby theatre with captain marvel showings but little shazam showings
Apr 15 2019,positive,people were expecting something very different tell you what a marvel movie shouldnt be all action and kaboom captain marvel tells us a back story and yes it has some gaps but its on track and enjoyable
Apr 15 2019,negative,pretty lame too much effort on trying to view nick fury as incompetent
Apr 15 2019,negative,this isnt a marvel movie its a womans empowerment film which is ok if youre into that kind of thing a good daddy daughter date movie 
Apr 15 2019,positive,i really enjoyed this movie its really awesome to see a female lead in a marvel movie definitely cant wait to see her in the next avengers movie 
Apr 15 2019,negative,lackluster story shoehorned character and overpowered hero with no real stakes
Apr 15 2019,positive,it was ok not the best marvel movie but not the worst either it was a good set up movie 
Apr 15 2019,positive,i think this movie does a great job showing the history or the kree and introducing captain marvel into the marvel verse i just think people are harsh to judge because shes not wonder woman me personally im excited to see what this chicks gonna bring to the avengers and beyond
Apr 15 2019,positive,a really good film for an origin story
Apr 15 2019,negative,worst mcu movie yet mostly because of brie larsons horrible performance both samuel l jackson and gregg clark gave above average performancegood script
Apr 15 2019,negative,not worth a comment
Apr 15 2019,negative,the movie had some funny moments and my favorite character wad goose samuel l jackson was funny but i wasnt watching nick furry i was watching samuel l jackson it completly disregarded the mcu continuity and i walked out of the theater with more questions than answers  it also felt like brie larson was acting in a different movie she would laugh or smirk at weird times that would throw me out of the scene and was told she was being emotional when there was no over abundance of emotion she felt very disconnected  from the movie and the other characters in the movie the movie also glossed over what looked to be an abusive parent as if that is how all parents are which is not a good message to send it was an okay movie but not something i would want to watch again or tell other people to see
Apr 15 2019,positive,very enjoyable movie handles itself it the mcu very well and answers some questions that other movies presented i felt brie larson handled her role well and the direction of the movie was extremely fluid movie also has a great sound track and has plenty of flair a must see in theaters in my opinion 
Apr 15 2019,positive,she is awesome and it turns out the 90s had some great music great to see how it all began right before we see how it all ends
Apr 15 2019,positive,i completely utterly loved it
Apr 15 2019,positive,i loved the fact that this felt more like a scifi film instead of our typical superhero movies 
Apr 15 2019,positive,good addition to the marvel universe larson looked hot as hell movie kinda dragged and needed more work on script
Apr 15 2019,negative,this is the worst film in mceu expectations were high since she is the most powerful avenger but the way the story was told makes it a poor movie the back drop of illegal immigrants and sexists tone leaves a poor taste
Apr 14 2019,negative,remember almost nothing from the movie very by the numbers
Apr 14 2019,negative,even though captain marvel is liked by others who watched the movie in my opinion it lacked communication to the audiences main informative knowledge known as the marvel comic books established in 1961 itd would be more beneficial to the real life adaptation of marvel comics if they had included characters that formulate close interactions with the protagonist with the exclusion of samuel l jacksons impersonation of nick fury and the contradictions of the deterred modernized story that is captain marvel
Apr 14 2019,negative,the movie was a huge disappointment as whole 
Apr 14 2019,negative,the movie ended up being boring because captain marvel was clearly never in any danger at all how can you end a movie with a 20 minute fight scene when the scene begins by establishing that the main character is invincible    the emotional arc also felt very off she achieves her true strength and earns her character when she defies and stands up to the supreme being however she had already made this decision about 15 minutes prior during the movie when she decided to betray the cree and help the shifters further as far as that being the moment she earns her full powers that was done poorly as well she was already unbeatable so amping her strength up didnt do anything to benefit the story    that isnt to mention that the entire ending was kind of ruined by them playing im just a girl during the initial fight scene that was a fine song for the movie but the timing was completely off it added a lightfun mood to a scene that was supposed to be the dramatic climax of the film any tensiondrama was completely removed though there was little to begin within since as aforementioned she was invincible
Apr 14 2019,negative,good work on those effects on the screen but the tell the storie was so boring 
Apr 14 2019,positive,stoked for avengers end game when she makes her entrance this was the bomb
Apr 14 2019,negative,if youre looking forward to a great addition to the marvel cinemaverse this isnt it the story line was a snoozefest till the last 20 minutes or so the best parts were with fury  carlson such a disappointment i suppose girls will like the empowering message but id  have preferred an agent carter film or another wonder woman this completely missed the mark for either womens empowerment or a noteworthy addition to the marvel franchise
Apr 14 2019,negative,movie only became exciting during the last 30 minutes poor storytelling for the first hour and half
Apr 14 2019,positive,absolutely loved captain marvel and cant wait to see her again in avengers endgame 
Apr 14 2019,positive,awesome movie brie larson was amazing and the music was perfect
Apr 14 2019,positive,not the best superhero movie out there but i thought it was better than wonder woman
Apr 14 2019,positive,wow  so sorry i waited so long to see it  its up there with iron man the original as my alltime favorite marvel movie  i found it fresh and while it jumped around i was able to follow it with surprises and twists and turns  like iron man i wanted to see it again as i was leaving  cant say that about the other marvel movies  i would also rate it much higher as a woman hero movie over wonder woman didnt care for that at all
Apr 14 2019,positive,middle of the scale mcu and that is pretty good
Apr 14 2019,negative,this movie  was boring and predictable by far the worst marvel movie captain marvel was both unlikeable and over powered i cant state how much i am dissatisfied with this poorly done movie
Apr 14 2019,neutral,marvel gave a pretty mediocre answer to dcs wonder woman with this film but at least the cat was cool
Apr 14 2019,negative,liked the stan lee tribute uncharismatic lead and a pretty boring story no character arc to speak of for captain marvel in her first appearence
Apr 14 2019,positive,captian marvel was a good fun marvel film any marvel fan would enjoy
Apr 14 2019,positive,good but not exceptional
Apr 14 2019,positive,this is absolutely the best movie ive seen so far this year and exactly the direction i want to see the mcu go now that its losing its current powerhouses captain marvel is easily one of my top 5 mcu films and i cant wait to see what they do next with this character
Apr 14 2019,negative,well the short story is this is a pretty boring movie with a joyless protagonist who has negative chemistry with any other person on the screen
Apr 14 2019,positive,marvel has done it again
Apr 14 2019,positive,this movie was action packed  thats why i liked it so much
Apr 14 2019,positive,overall a good but also partially disappointing movie considering the powerlevel of the character introducted the movie is good entertainment but feels like a phase 1 movie and carol suffers from uneven writing and  or directing her character remains pretty fuzzy is she a smartass or rather stoic or emotional you never know here also the movie has a plot twist that not all diehard fans might like i did but i felt like it was very underused and onthenose overall a mustsee only for mcu addicted fans for anyone else relatively standard superhero fare
Apr 14 2019,positive,was a wonderful movie and wasnt as feminists crazy as most of the review where saying its was very well written and explained old plot holes from other movies
Apr 14 2019,positive,this was one of the most captivating marvel movies i loved captain marvel as a character and brie larson was amazing i saw it three times in the theater and cant wait for home release
Apr 14 2019,positive,if only the directors could be given the liberty to explore the main character in a broader way this makes the movie an average origin story    that said the movie is still enjoyable and worth spending the time and money 
Apr 14 2019,positive,as a wannabe writer i am most pleased with the direction they took with the villains and heroes rather than going the easy way all i needed was a fun marvel movie to introduce me to captain marvel for the overall mcu timeline and i got it i may not have connected with her character like i wanted to probably because i have never had amnesia or been converted to an alien race before i wont go into plot details but act 3 was my favorite because it subverted my expectations of what they would do with the skrulls and kree and i look forward to seeing captain marvel getting her confidence shaken by thanos so she can become a team player with the avengers so go see it like it or dont have your own opinion but dont give this movie trash that it doesnt necessarily have ï 12ï 12â
Apr 14 2019,positive,a for effort  i just feel that it was so handcuffed to set up the plot points that captain marvel and the rubiks cube are the only way to defeat thanos that captain marvel story got lost along the way
Apr 14 2019,neutral,going into the movie i generally wanted it to be great the movie was just okay brei larson acting felt more close to kristian stewarts in the twlight movies they made nick fury an idoit in this film and completley ignored how he actually got his scar i found brei larsons costars to actually out perform her the movie wasnt terrible it just was one of thoose movies where you just want to turn off your brain because the writing is pretty awful
Apr 14 2019,negative,lamest marvel movie yet brie larson was a poor choice and was poorly written cant take her seriously gal gadot did a much better job with wonder woman  she acts like a little girl when her full potential is unleashed and it just comes across as stupid the over the top attempt at forced humor falls flat samuel l jacksons strange obsession with a cat the fact the cat turns into a tentacle creature  its all just all kinds of unnecessary  and its boring the character is so powerful it makes the rest of the avengers seem like normal people even thor and hulk shes basically superman on super steroids  wish i hadnt  seen it
Apr 14 2019,positive,the first 30 minutes is really hard to follow but after that it becomes an ok mcu film i dont think brie larson brought anything special to the table but maybe after a couple more films shell fit in well
Apr 14 2019,positive,easily one of the best superhero films marvel has produced in ages the ensemble films are always entertaining but it was an unusually refreshing experience to return to a solo heros origin story reminiscent of the best of the phase one films bonus as much as this movie is a captain marvel origin story its subplot is also very much a nick fury origin tale with coulson along for the ride as well i was nervous about seeing these actors digitally deaged but the effects were astonishingly nuanced and believable i truly felt like id gone back in time    brie larson plays a compelling emotionally complex carol danvers and it was wonderful watching her character sort out the mysteries of her past she is easy to root for and frankly a total badass it was refreshing to see a movie that wasnt featuring an arrogant egotistical character who gains power and somehow grows a conscience by the end of the film iron man thor dr strange peter quilllove em all but theres kind of a pattern here carol danvers is her own unique character with her own unique character development    i also commend the writing and directing for not saying away from the every day adversity women face from misogynysts without ever becoming preachy or overbearing and in true sliceoflife fashion for every man making a derogatory comment about a female pilot or a woman not embracing catcalling there is an ally who treats women with respect and decency agent fury for the win this movie has come under a lot of scrutiny for containing feminist themes so let me put it in these terms there are heroes in this movie and there are villains there are both male and female characters in both roles that in my opinion is equality in representation    as far as plot goes i was never bored the story and action were consistently thrilling andor interesting all the way through from start to finish    in short i highly recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of either the superhero or scifi genre
Apr 14 2019,negative,was pretty disappointed after i saw this movie there was pretty much no character development for the protagonist and the only that barely saved the movie for me was the presence of samuel l jacksons character in it i dont recommend seeing this movie
Apr 14 2019,neutral,so the movie is fine thats about all that i can say its about the 11th best marvel movie the plot is ehhh the characters are boring and brie larson was awkward in it she was wooden and felt like she was reading her lines how do you win an oscar one year and two years later act so poorly anyway see it or dont see it either way its forgettable 
Apr 14 2019,negative,boring plot close to no action dont stay for after credits clips even that sucked you will be disappointed leaving theater 
Apr 14 2019,negative,i was very skeptical about seeing this movie due to the controversies surrounding it but after seeing it i can honestly say the movie itself is nothing really special
Apr 14 2019,negative,i really didnt enjoy this film i wanted to like it because it was mcu but i was bored and didnt like the main character 
Apr 14 2019,negative,i was extremely underwhelmed with this marvel property the sad thing is i am a huge marvel fan i have supported every other property theyve done there are issues with the writing and the direction i had a serious issue with samuel l being the comedic role brie larson was a good choice she played the part well it was just written too flat i found no way to connect with her character i felt more connected with all of the supporting characters including some of the villains than hers i put that on the writing and directing it is supposed to be set in the nineties but i never got that sense out of it i know there will be a sequel and i pray that they really dig in for it give me a likeable heroin im just glad that endgame is right around the corner and i have aspirations that the russos can do a better job with the character
Apr 14 2019,negative,marvel disappointed by politicizing this one 
Apr 14 2019,negative,was very disappointedto say this movie was made for a certain group of people is an understatementi love the marvel movies but this probably the worst movie the mcu has put out in awhile poorly written  poorly directed poorly actedtwo thumbs down
Apr 14 2019,negative,boring disjointed poor actingwhats wrong with these critics
Apr 13 2019,negative,this was easily the worst of the mcu movies it was just awful 
Apr 13 2019,positive,it was a good movie nothing too extra
Apr 13 2019,positive,contained some excellent scenes filling up some holes that were open until now in the mcu but is rather an average marvel movie
Apr 13 2019,positive,overall a good single time watch 
Apr 13 2019,positive,i had super high hopes for this movie based off the comics and what marvel has been able to do in the past i was unfortunately disappointed yes brie larson was able to play the character pretty well but the script just sucked somehow carols entire origin story was overlooked and they decided to showcase the war that was happening between the kree and skrulls along with brainwashing her we barely got  ten minutes of carols backstory all told in flashbacks and we didnt ever get to know her as a character were told the whole time that vers is emotional and cant control herself or her powers yet we never really get to see this except for a couple zaps to jude law i still loved to see a female character on screen but i wanted an origin story
Apr 13 2019,positive,it was good  not my favorite mcu movie but it was ok
Apr 13 2019,negative,what could of been a good film ends up being a mess due to a terrible lead with the only good thing being nick fury and the cat
Apr 13 2019,positive,its okay its not terrible but its not all that great either brie larsen was just fine in the role but she didnt have much to do to really show her personality she shows flashes but ultimately doesnt do much to win me over however i did enjoy samuel l jackson as nick fury which is nothing new but the deaging technology worked great and it was never jarring goose the cat was cool too
Apr 13 2019,positive,it was a really good movie overall it had a good introduction and rising action i just feel it was lacking a bit in the climax
Apr 13 2019,positive,great as always from marvel immediately when i heard brie larson was cast in this role i thought that makes perfect sense was not disappointed
Apr 13 2019,positive,wondrous exhilarating joyous funny what a beautiful movie it was thrilling for our entire family 
Apr 13 2019,positive,this movie was fun sam jackson and brie larson were great 
Apr 13 2019,positive,i thought it was a solid marvel movie  it doesnt deserve a 58 audience score  i would give it at least 83
Apr 13 2019,positive,i loved this movie dont understand all the hate based on some imaginary feminist agenda was she kicking butt yes but shes a superhero was a lot of that butt male yes not her fault doesnt make her a feminist and those still upset over brie larsons comments you took them way out context and need to go a look over her response no reason to trash a movie just because you got you feelings a little hurt 
Apr 13 2019,positive,this deserves a 100
Apr 13 2019,positive,loved it the 90s nostalgia was awesome
Apr 13 2019,positive,yay for captain marvel 
Apr 13 2019,negative,mostly boring outside of a few cliche action scenes this film fell flat for me largely due to the awkward acting of the lead character several parts of this film  are eyerollingly bad including the on the nose music choice over the top jeering male antagonists in captain marvels past and a scene involving a furry alien and nick fury which was so bad it was hard to believe     this was certainly a step back for the mcu which had made great strides over the past few years to fix the flaws in their films such as the onenote villains     i dont recommend this film
Apr 13 2019,positive,good movie not as good as the others
Apr 13 2019,positive,i saw this on my birthday i honestly grasped the meaning as a psychological synopsis about an alter ego we each are aware of and fighting for freedom from anything that leaves us feeling trapped as a personal traumatic battle that has to break free amazing rated r for gorey content never seen anything with this plot twist or development
Apr 13 2019,positive,the movie was fine and funny  but the hero was way too powerfull  seemed like overkill  looks like she will deliver the finishing blow to thanos which is dissapointing  she also doesnt seem to have any weaknesses god mode on
Apr 13 2019,positive,i thought it was a great movie my only complaint is that i wish there had been a little more of the cat
Apr 13 2019,positive,awesome addition to the marvel universe i didnt even want to see this movie because i couldnt picture brie larson as a believable superhero i got dragged to it by my fiancï 12 c and it ended up being one of my favorite of the all the marvel movies definitely worth going to see and i cant wait to see her come back in end game
Apr 13 2019,positive,i had my reservations going in due to all the metacontroversy and frankly the trailers didnt do the movie any favors but i ended up pleasantly surprised its not the best marvel movie by any stretch but its solidly entertaining with good action and fun banter    looking at it after the fact frankly both sides of the controversy are comically overblown captain marvel is hardly the pinnacle of strong female characters but neither is it an allout attack on masculinity larsons portrayal and carols characterization is fine if not terribly memorable and the areas where men are negatively depicted are limited and i think appropriately contextualized  controversy is being injected where none really exists by people on both sides of the issue    overall captain marvel is a fun way to pass a few hours with strong performances by the supporting characters fun action scenes and another clever use of an anachronistic sound track in a marvel movie
Apr 13 2019,negative,lazy writing with so so effects could have been better
Apr 13 2019,positive,fantastic movie just not the greatest movie before endgame
Apr 13 2019,neutral,least memorable marvel movie in a while 
Apr 13 2019,positive,shes legit the real deal
Apr 13 2019,neutral,not the best marvel movie the nick fury  capt marvel relationship added much needed humour and the scroll chief character is the only thing that made it interesting 
Apr 13 2019,negative,the unfunny jokes and corny one liners almost distract you from the boring and unoriginal plot the best part is the cat
Apr 13 2019,positive,great film with interesting characters and story
Apr 13 2019,negative,i have been a movie addict for 30 years and like most of what i see i am not that hard to please this movie is the first movie i have ever walked out on
Apr 13 2019,negative,too much effort in creating a perfect hero
Apr 13 2019,negative,brie larson is good as captain marvel but movie is not so great and entertaining just another routine origin story
Apr 13 2019,negative,this movie can be summed up in one word boring
Apr 13 2019,positive,must see movie i loved it 
Apr 13 2019,positive,great plot and action sequences some of the humour missed the mark but that was a small drawback to an otherwise great film
Apr 13 2019,positive,i dont care about what people say i think this movie absolutely awesome one of the best movies of the mcu im love with brie larson
Apr 13 2019,positive,captain marvel wasnt as great as many of marvels other movies but it wasnt their worst
Apr 13 2019,positive,lots of good stuff but not as good as the best marvel movies goose steals the show
Apr 13 2019,positive,really good more visuals than other avengers movies not as strong of a story line but i really enjoyed the movie 
Apr 13 2019,negative,bland movie not bad but not good brie larson was horribly miss cast everyone else out acts her her character is also so unbelievably arrogant and full of herself with no humor to it not likeable 
Apr 13 2019,positive,overall this was a decent marvel movie and the action was great and the visuals were on point but some of the acting was terrible and it was slow at some points
Apr 13 2019,neutral,the 5 star reviews for this movie are definitely fake its rather unbelievable that anyone could possibly think this movie was great for an mcu movie its beyond horrible probably would have been a complete bomb at the box office if it wasnt part of the mcu series if youre planning on seeing avengers endgame you might as well see this movie just keep your expectations very low youll still probably end up being disappointed even with low expectations 
Apr 13 2019,negative,lacked a lot of character development brie larson is too stiff and way overpowered i am waiting on the merger between xmen and avengers so rogue can steal her powers permanently 
Apr 13 2019,positive,loved it it was fun and entertaining and full of little bits that filled in back stories it was everything a superhero movie should be to me it doesnt take itself too seriously it feels like early star trek plus as a human who graduated hs in ahem 1995 i absolutely love that much of the movie takes place during that time frame 
Apr 13 2019,positive,is movie is tribute of women power
Apr 13 2019,positive,overall enjoyable and a good introduction to the character however she is the mcu version comic book fans may be disappointed it ruins or changes the skrull storyline and nick fury as well the cat is accurate except it belongs to carol in the comic
Apr 13 2019,negative,some funny moments but not enough to make the movie worthwhile i really wanted to like the movie but by the end i was bored and disinterested
Apr 12 2019,positive,everything happened pretty fast they did not even explain who was vers
Apr 12 2019,positive,loved it shes the superhero we need
Apr 12 2019,positive,this is one of the best marvel movies to date the characters were well developed the story was great to follow and even though you pretty much knew what was going to happen there were still plenty of twists and surprises 
Apr 12 2019,negative,boring save your money
Apr 12 2019,positive,not much to really say i just really enjoyed the movie i guess it just hit that x factor for me the mcu already is a good universe of movies but captain marvel added a lot to it
Apr 12 2019,positive,great origin story this ride builds excitement and absolutely delivers at the finale strong cast great humor love that this hero was strong intelligent and a great fighter one of my fav marvel films for sure 
Apr 12 2019,neutral,a marvel movie with very mixed quality the theme and pacing was very inconsistent the plot and a lot of its elements are nonnonsensical you will notice that the plot moves like the characters do not consider the consequences of their actions this film retcons significant plots in the other mcu film to push a narrative its that or the writers just didnt watch the other mcu films the music did not enhance the emotion of the scenes unlike the guardians of the galaxy retro tracks the music felt forced and pretentiouscaptain marvel and her arc were the worst parts of the film you really had to squint so see the little character development she has in the film my girlfriend liked this film even less that i did
Apr 12 2019,positive,very enjoyable movie   nice story  good action
Apr 12 2019,negative,disappointment  captain marvelmovie is boring
Apr 12 2019,positive,amazing movie solid storyline with a very exciting twist 
Apr 12 2019,positive,its a marvel movie so you know its good going in did a great job of capturing the 90s feel surprisingly it felt like a phase 1 movie which given when it takes place in the canon that makes perfect sense 
Apr 12 2019,negative,this movie was pretty blah the rapport between bri larson and basically any other character in the film seemed forced also the whole girl power theme was heavy handed i know thats the flavor of the times but its just getting old wonder woman was a way better film if youre looking for a film about a strong female character this just smacked of rebellious teen angst but from a middle aged mediocre actress it just wasnt that well done and im not looking forward to more of this character in the marvel universe
Apr 12 2019,positive,dont really see where the hate for this movie comes from its really just your typical origin movie obviously it wont compare to the likes of infinity war but its still a good movie if youre a marvel fan
Apr 12 2019,positive,its in the middle of marvel movies pretty forgettable but not terrible larson is a great actress but i dont feel shes the right for on this role shes not particularly likeable in this movie and i enjoyed the supporting cast much more in this movie
Apr 12 2019,positive,while not a bad film it wasnt totally great either in my opinion it felt like they needed an origin story before endgame despite this it definitely had a lot of enjoyable characters samuel l jackson was great as usual and larshana lynch was absolutely phenomenal brie larson was good but just that nothing special in fact my sister said that maria the pilot would have been a better captain marvel take that with a grain of salt because my sister doesnt enjoy comic book movies to a high degree
Apr 12 2019,negative,worst mcu movie so far 
Apr 12 2019,neutral,very disappointed with this movie i had very high expectations being a marvel movie and it let me down
Apr 12 2019,positive,theres no doubt after watching this that captain marvel is the key in defeating thanos in endgame carol danvers is the most valuable mcu character and there is a reason why it took her forever to appear on the big screen captain marvel is an origin story and this is its biggest drawback as an origin story it weakens the character it weakens the thematics actually and hinters the movie we did get a glimpse of what captain marvel can do what she will bring to the bigger picture but still it feels like we never got to really see who she really is we have a mere idea of who carol danvers was before and of who she became now but still the connection is not strong enough captain marvel sure feels like the powerhouse she is meant to be but we havent seen her soul yet brie larson and samuel l jackson work amazingly as a team brie larson knows her character and that is evident but the thing is we didnt get to know her very well i cant wait for endgame the dynamics  are really going to change with this one
Apr 12 2019,negative,this isnt the worst movie ive ever seen but it was certainly a disappointment compared to the rest of the mcu movies
Apr 12 2019,negative,wasted my money on movie ticket
Apr 12 2019,positive,lacks a coherent backstory origin or establishment of motivation for the titular character action wit and supporting characters elevate the movie to an average rating
Apr 12 2019,positive,i feel like im a little old for the target audience but still a fun movie i wish we had a movie like this 15 years ago finally a superhero movie that doesnt just pander to teenage boys just what ive been waiting for
Apr 12 2019,positive,great pic  cant wait to see the sequel
Apr 12 2019,positive,as a marvel film i completely understand why people found it underwhelming  our expectations have been raised because of the superb films weve had at late     is it as mind blowing as infinity war no does it have a strong and unique voice like guardians of the galaxy not at all but its still an enjoyable film    the acting is spot on despite a script that was a little lacking the humor was funny and while carols personal journey could have been told more effectively it still made sense     this is not the worst movie in the franchise note the weakest thor was much weaker in character development loki was that movies saving grace but thats easy to forget when lately weve been getting so many topnotch movies     im looking forward to seeing more of captain marvel in the future
Apr 12 2019,neutral,as an origin story for captain marvel i thought this did poorly i still dont feel like i know who she is as for empowering women this movie did excellent job
Apr 12 2019,positive,i thought captain marvel was a solid entry into the mcu but didnt fulfill its true potential
Apr 12 2019,positive,the film is very underrated by fans and anti brie larson fans even when she pulls off a good performance here she is judged the character is never shown to convey emotion so larson dosnt it is really good acting on her behalf she isnt milking it jackson is amazing like always and it really is funny how he lost his eye the storytelling is great has a lovely score and is a new step forward in the mcu the post credits scene is amazing and same goes for the film yet it is very cringe at points so for me captain marvel gets an 8510
Apr 12 2019,positive,loved it saw it with an open mind as i have all other marvel movies came out thoroughly entertained as always
Apr 12 2019,positive,lots of fun its not shakespeare but it wasnt meant to be great effects and we enjoyed it
Apr 12 2019,negative,movie was meh simple as that i left the theater feeling ripped off we deserve better from marveldisney
Apr 12 2019,negative,skrulls the murderous and genocidal alien race of shapeshifters  as refugies rip mcu
Apr 12 2019,negative,i do not know where to start from the many defects of the film first cgi where i want to ask marvel is supposed to get a battle or drawing animation  second the actress who did not represent did not you pay her enough money and decided to agree with her half a share of representation she was laughing so hard  third the weak and shameful plot of the film unfortunately any follower of the marvel world in the serials followed for the marf film world will know very easily that the cree are the bad guys and not the good guys in this film  well well why did the movie give two stars of ten if  the first is nick fiori and the second is the music  thanks for this bad movie and i wish the next of the series would be a little better
Apr 12 2019,positive,nothing too special but nothing bad at all captain marvel is a solid entry in the mcu with good pacing action as well as good acting my only issues with the film is that even at the end i still dont believe that captain marvel is the most powerful hero in the mcu so far and it does get a little questionable with some very poor choices made in the story as well as some choppy and unclear writing all together its still and entertaining and solid mcu film
Apr 12 2019,positive,very nicely done and with great character development they added a strong character development while retaining her femininity looking forward to seeing more of the capt
Apr 12 2019,neutral,no as good as advertised
Apr 12 2019,positive,captian mervel is amozing overall i would say packed with action humor and visual thrills captain marvel introduces the mcus latest hero with an origin story that makes effective use of the franchises signature formula i like captaon merbvel badonadoks
Apr 12 2019,negative,boring you can tell brie larson cant do action the movie has some good humor but overall its boring dont watch it
Apr 12 2019,negative,everything is so perfunctory and lifeless in this movie that i almost fell asleep several times while watching it
Apr 12 2019,positive,par for the course nothing special to see here 
Apr 12 2019,negative,impossible to care about the character add an actress with the charisma of a robot and you just dont care 
Apr 12 2019,positive,it is an easy watch and has followed the comedic approach of the latest thor film both super marvel fans and normal cinema goes will enjoy but i cant help feeling that something is missing
Apr 12 2019,positive,an nice addition to the mcu an okay good movie
Apr 12 2019,positive,i really enjoyed this film and watched it 2x in theaters one on a sunday afternoon and a tuesday a week after     and as nice as the story was im not a fan of monologues but like most of the mcus heroes its nice that there was a bit of a background story behind cm coz i know nothing about her  as to how she is called the strongest superhero of mcu  and after watching the whole film cm has become my most favorite superhero next to thor    moreover contrary to what the hatersbashers say where they review first before watching the whole film simply by basing their review from their cohaters opinion brie larson fit the role of captain marvel  after seeing the way she speaks or carrying herself and what she stands for i say she is definitely perfect for the role shes got some dry sense of humor and so is carol danvers  so whenever i see her during interviews theres only a minimal difference between brie larson and captain marvel minus the superpowers aside from that i can sum it up that brie larson is definitely the captain marvelcarol danvers
Apr 11 2019,positive,my wife  i liked it we watched it 3 times i admit the main skrull has an australian accent it doesnt make since but it was kind of funny the fighting scene with nick fury  the australian skrull was disappointing as well sam jackson is a little old to play a young nick fury it shows a little in that scene other than that he continues to do a good job with fury some of captain marvels attempt at comedy fell flat it wasnt perfect but we still liked it
Apr 11 2019,positive,awesome movie loved the whole plot idea and sound track marvel did it again
Apr 11 2019,negative,when are the good movies coming out
Apr 11 2019,positive,awesome movie must see far from perfect but very good non the less 
Apr 11 2019,positive,amazing movie need more woman lead superhero movie and not 3 decades from now
Apr 11 2019,positive,wao that was great movie
Apr 11 2019,positive,fantastic the music the story the action it was amazing
Apr 11 2019,positive,i thought it was great like another user made me go home and rewatch other marvel users brie did a phenomenal job
Apr 11 2019,positive,its a good movie why you guys giving it a bad rating
Apr 11 2019,positive,good marvel moviehaters will hate
Apr 11 2019,neutral,not a very good movie  the first part of the movie was all over the place  the story was not very good  lastly the actress playing captain marvel wasnt good  in fairness i dont know if she is just a bad actress or if it was because her characters story wasnt very good  jude law was a bright spot in the movie
Apr 11 2019,positive,wate 30 min and it will be good
Apr 11 2019,positive,movie had some decent parts in it you dont have to see this movie to see the next avengers movie the main complaint was how far off they go from the comics and some of the plot messes with the timeline of the mcu
Apr 11 2019,positive,thoroughly enjoyed this addition to the mcu just a couple of scenes with captain marvel were facial expressions just didnt gell for me dropping me out of the moment beyond that nitpick it was cool
Apr 11 2019,negative,the only thing this movie lacks is life and heart and you dont really feel anything watching this and it forces you to invest into the charecters
Apr 11 2019,positive,a phenomenal movie for so many reasons the main character is a strong capable and interesting woman she is fully clothed she is a jet pilot before she became a super there are respectful relationships between people of different races i could go on and on
Apr 11 2019,positive,saw with husband and teen  they loved this fresh new story but some of the humour was just too silly and upset the balance for me
Apr 11 2019,positive,loved it action packed well paced and great performances the cgi de aging samuel jackson was scary good plan to to see again 
Apr 11 2019,negative,i see only because marvel no have a good history and have a bad actress
Apr 11 2019,positive,i love this movie it made me want to go back home and look at all of the marvel movies 
Apr 11 2019,positive,brie larson captivates the audience with her incredible and belivable performance samuel l jackson and ben mendleson also had amazing performances the begining of the movie is a little wonky but it makes up for it in special effects and a well thought out plot
Apr 11 2019,positive,better than i thought but a rushed and edited horribly that makes the story flow dishinged but solid characters and acting the best part was lieutenant trouble aka the real captain marvel
Apr 11 2019,positive,overall i enjoyed it it had humor without going overboard looking at you guardians vol 2 and some fun action scenes for me the storytelling was clunky and the movie took a while to find its footing     brie larson did a fine job in the lead role but it felt like she wasnt given much to work with the character of carol danvers had appeal but she didnt offer the same instant click that previous characters like tony stark and steve rogers do  that being said shes new to the franchise and im sure well get plenty of that growth with future films     the strongest point of this movie and its a big one exists in its supporting cast and characters samuel l jackson owned the young nick fury role and i loved lashana lynch as maria rambeau once that chemistry was present the movie became much more invigorating     obviously a theme for this film was feminism and a message that screams girl power which is great i didnt feel like it went overboard with the exception of jude laws character saying you cant control your emotions every other scene he was in by the end of the film he was still spitting that out and my eyes rolled so hard i thought they were going to get stuck it was pretty much his entire role in the film we also get to find out how nick fury lost his eye i wont spoil anything but i was not amused honestly they would have been better off leaving that a mystery     so not the mcus best movie not even top 5 for me it was a good time though and id certainly watch it again and one thing is for sure its got me super pumped for end game      j
Apr 11 2019,positive,super movie one of my favorites
Apr 11 2019,positive,a great movie full of great scenes and uses a predictable formula to its advantage
Apr 11 2019,positive,its a really good introduction movie for captain marvel filled with good jokes
Apr 11 2019,positive,not bad could be better the heroine is not fully disclosed
Apr 11 2019,positive,captain marvel is a great movieit gives young girls a super hero to look up to the fact its set in the 1990s gives it a very mcu phase 1 feel which is very familiar and refreshing to people like myself who started with the mcu from the beginning brie larsons acting is great and she is definetly the best choice for the role
Apr 11 2019,positive,i really enjoyed this movie well made 
Apr 11 2019,negative,you know how in almost every marvel movie the main character changes his views on the things he does like he turns to be better yeahnot here
Apr 11 2019,negative,overall probably the worst mcu movie ive seen i was disappointed with brie for the simple fact that she didnt bring energy into the film ben mendelsohn was awesome as usual sam j is always good 
Apr 11 2019,positive,middle of the road marvel origin story liked it but not loved it
Apr 11 2019,negative,origin movieskip it advances the overall story arc by zero
Apr 11 2019,positive,last night i went to the cinema with my two grandchildren and we loved it especially the kids 13 and 15 years old i don t really like superheroes but this movie is perfect in my opinion its very funny to see my two grandchildren having so much fun  i really hope for a trilogy for this this one very interesting character
Apr 11 2019,positive,this movie was good enough that i saw it twice i do that very rarely i thought the movie was fun and i look forward to seeing carol danvers in end game
Apr 11 2019,negative,while captain marvel makes a good paced start it steadily become not very interesting i found myself becoming bored and waiting for the film to end it even blunted my enthusiasm for end game when it should have got me excited for the next avengers film if you thinking about going to see this film you should take that into account
Apr 11 2019,neutral,cg was good carol danvers wasnt
Apr 11 2019,positive,i feel so surprised that this movie has a low audience rating for me it was one of  the best solo superhero movie out there right now i love the cast and the story captain marvel make want to know more about her character i wound not miss the sequel 
Apr 11 2019,positive,loved it great piece to the marvel universe
Apr 11 2019,negative,the worst movie in marvels series the action scenes were pathetic as well as the plot and final showdown fight
Apr 11 2019,positive,saw captain marvel at cineworld it was good nice 90s references especially the pulp fiction ones love those samual l jackson is fun goose is such an adorable cat but overall i didnt get that feeling yknow someone must understand what im saying here that feeling in your chest when watching a movie didnt even get a little of that shame  i usually get that feeling from the other marvel movies but this one nope    and no im not saying that because the main character is a woman i am totally fine with that
Apr 11 2019,negative,easily the worst film ive seen
Apr 11 2019,positive,big marvel fan really liked it
Apr 10 2019,negative,1 its boring   2 cat and lead skrull were the best in the movie   3 clear agenda   4 no character build up   5 continuity is is all messed up   6 wonder women was a better female lead movie
Apr 10 2019,positive,stunning vfx and also there is no love interest wooooo
Apr 10 2019,positive,there is nothing specific that can say that i did not like very good performance especially brie entertaining action great soundtrack and an unexpected twist one of my favorite marvel movie
Apr 10 2019,neutral,it was a decent build up to what could occur in the upcoming avengers end game movie but i think the actress was a poor choice so the film suffered it was almost robotic as though she had no emotion or depth 
Apr 10 2019,positive,good movie admittedly as origin stories go far from the worst marvel film in areas where i think it could have been transcendent it settled on cute brie larson and ben mendelsohn along with yes goose were the aboslute stars of the movie unfortunately jude law sam l jackson were just poor after thoughts i highly look forward to the sequel as i am sure it will be better  and for people who just tore into the movie because it has a female lead  i guess i would say enjoy your basements
Apr 10 2019,negative,horrible movie waste my 15 bucks and 2 hours i will never get back story was completely awful didnt make any sense screen play was poorly done the actress seem to know only one expression on her face  squinting her eyes for everything all in all a lazily produced movie with no passion or meaning     save your money
Apr 10 2019,negative,some of the worst movie stories in the world its boring
Apr 10 2019,negative,very boring i was just going to see her to see what connection there was with endgame but if i knew it was going to be so boring i would have searched for the leaks online    the star is only for the postcredits
Apr 10 2019,positive,a fantastic movie cant wait to see more from captain marvel
Apr 10 2019,positive,stellar film thats good scifi and fits all the pieces together loved larsens portrayal of someone indomitable the jokes were good too what a nice buddy chemistry between her and jackson
Apr 10 2019,positive,super enjoyable clean marvel fun  could have taken more risks but in general captivating and funny
Apr 10 2019,positive,despite the political fallout this is a good movie and if you are a true marvel fan you will at least watch it
Apr 10 2019,positive,marvel does it again while it might not be the best film in the mcu it gives us a lot of fun
Apr 10 2019,negative,worst movie of the marvel franchise
Apr 10 2019,positive,this movie was delightfully hilarious and was put together very well brie larson as captain marvel was an amazing choice she played the role beautifully and gave a very convincing performance 1010 would watch again
Apr 10 2019,positive,one of the better marvel movies ive seen
Apr 10 2019,positive,a really great comic book movie
Apr 10 2019,negative,simply a boring and waytoosafe mcu film i saw this for free and i still felt ripped off
Apr 10 2019,neutral,most boring movie in the mcu to date could have done better in the casting department for captain marvel for an oscar winner brie larson really misses the mark
Apr 10 2019,positive,great movie my whole family went we liked it i think most the things wrong with it are minor it has a good twist its one major problem is the retcons like nick fury i dont want to spoil anything for those that didnt see it yet so thats all i will put
Apr 10 2019,negative,i loved samuel jackson in this film captain marvel could have been great but when you choose an actress who doesnt have even a tiny bit of athleticism its a challenge watching her as a super hero or in any action film i laughed the first time i saw her run and her hero poses were comical my wife burst out laughing too shes a very good actress when she is not messing up super hero movies 
Apr 10 2019,negative,this movie feels out of place we have been through 10 years of marvel movies all leading up to endgame and this new character parachutes in 2 months before the big finale   the other avengers all went through incredible sacrifice and had to reinvent themselves stark was the self centered jerk that changed when he got a chest full of shrapnel and saw his weapons used by the bad guys thor was completely stripped of his power and cast out of asgard captain america was the skinny kid who got the super serum but shortly after went down for a 70 year nap in the ice     captain marvel doesnt have such an interesting story her big challenge was apparently overcoming people trying to hold her back because she is a woman she is never really shown weakened lacking her true powers or having to figure out who she is separate from her powers as has been the case for all of the other characters her acting didnt really help but i think that was mostly because of the script not because brie isnt capable of a better performance   i suspect we will see her get smacked down early in endgame and have to find herself and a way to overcome her newly found lack of invincibility   realistically we havent even seen thanos at full strength he didnt bother killing all of the heroes in infinity war because he didnt see them as a big enough threat to be worth killing except stark who he went out of his way to kill until dr strange intervened     i think captain marvel will grow on me in future movies but her introduction was just clunky and felt like it was shoved into place rather than belonging 2 months before endgame
Apr 10 2019,negative,if it wasnt for samuel l jackson this would have a onestar rating brie is hot but boring her military flashbacks were not believable soldiers never tell another they cant overcome an obstacle the attempts at humor consistently failed no chemistry between brie and samuel     the main problem is that the character is fundamentally uninteresting both the backstory and the powers lack creativity disneys original plan was to have adam warlock join the avengers but they decided to go with a female lead instead ok but they either chose the wrong character or failed to modify the character in an interesting manner    i really hope she doesnt ruin avengers endgame
Apr 10 2019,negative,not the best made me want to sleep n all honesty i wanted to give it a shot but it was just bad
Apr 10 2019,negative,while most actors put out a solid performance bri larson and every other kree feel bland both the skrulls and the kree are boring and generic as villans the twist about the skrulls isnt surprising in any way and moments of emotional payoff ring out hollow due to a lack of set up as well as this moments that should have carol showing emotion have her keeping a totally straight face by the end carol seems to overpowered with little to no training it also slightly ruins the mystery and mythology of furys eye however samuel jackson lashana linch ben mendelsohn and others put up fun and heartfelt performances that along with goose being the best caracter in the mcu redeemes this film quite a bit overall captain marvel is a fun decent film that does not live up to the mcu or its cast
Apr 10 2019,negative,saw it not impressed
Apr 10 2019,positive,where do i start i saw captain marvel three times and i still get chills every time i see it the mcu finally having their first female superhero solo film is incredible captain marvel is an amazing film and perfect for all ages you discover a few things about nick fury  shield now after talking about how amazing the film is its time to talk why i didnt give it five stars the reason i didnt give it five stars is because there is somethings that is said in the film that doesnt match up with the first iron man film i highly suggest watching the first iron man then seeing captain marvel and pay close attention to figure out what they messed up it is something that is small but it doesnt match up with the ending of iron man overall though this is a great film to go see and i highly suggest you go do so
Apr 10 2019,positive,i dont usually bother with comments but this is my fist one because i felt a need to comment on this  it has aggravated me seeing the audience score for captain marvel  it is unfortunate that at this current time 4102019 captain marvel is marvels lowest audience score  below the fresh percentage the 1st marvel movie to have either critic or audience score below fresh because it does not deserve to be  granted it is not as good as some of the other marvel movies but how can it be being better than thor ragnarok guardians 1  2 is exceptionally hard it is still a fantastic movie  the cgi is amazing great comedy great actors great plot great all around movie some jokes were corny but what movie doesnt have corny jokes  if you look at the audience comments you can clearly see that a good majority are people who are dont like brie because she stands up for what she believes in is that so wrong  why rotten tomatoes has not removed most of these is beyond me because they clearly should  but beyond that if you like the movies marvel produces  have followed them since day 1 with iron man or technically the incredible hulk  for the past year all you have been thinking about is what will happen in endgame because you love these movies so much then you will like  no love  this one  i 100 recommend this movieit will be a fun ride
Apr 10 2019,negative,weird pacing incredibly lifeless performance from the lead actress saw a montage of scenes from her life that i should have connected with but the acting andor directing failed to establish that connection when steve rogers stands back up you get goose bumps when carol danvers does all you see is legs slowly raising an expressionless face and torso liked the cgi but this movie needed heart badly when you connect more to a comedy character like antman its a problem
Apr 10 2019,negative,the best characters in the mcu have had massive struggles in their personal movies that resulted in them becoming great  doctor strange lost his hands and became a wizard stark was maimed by his own weapon and became ironman thor was outcast by his father and had to mature in order to regain worthiness  this is the killer formula that was not at all present in captin marvel  she is boring unlikeable and at the end of the movie who even cares about carol danvers because we know little about her personality  skrulls were interesting characters and universe development was exciting but this is a shoddily put together film that sniffs of a rushed attempt at making a woman hero the centerpiece of the mcu  i am very upset that black widow or scarlett witch never got a solo movie examples of two wonderfully developed female characters who have been with the series for years and deserve more spotlight  if the directors of endgame focus the phase three finale more on making us like captin marvel instead of giving the original 6 avengers a proper sendoff i doubt i will continue to watch these movies
Apr 10 2019,negative,sucks and makes me fear for the future of marvel 
Apr 10 2019,positive,one of few movies where even the fight scenes are entertaining i loved it    had low expectations due to reviews portraying the captains character as flat and larson as a bad actor i did not think she needed to smile more if you think so you also need to ask batman captain america and superman  to do the same 
Apr 10 2019,negative,terrible acting is an understatement
Apr 10 2019,negative,average movie with no plot to start with
Apr 10 2019,positive,marvel has another hit the movie does a great jon not throwing in your face shes a girl we gei it by now ha just an awesome character that holds their own in the group story was a bit slow but its an orgin story it was to be expected when she sees stan lee i will never forger that moment
Apr 9 2019,negative,very mediocre marvel film nothing impressive
Apr 9 2019,positive,a second view was in order because of i loved it
Apr 9 2019,negative,not much happens in the movie and her finale fights could have been better the best part of this movie is samuel jackson there was a lot of potential but i didnt enjoy my second watch more of a onetime popcorn film interested to see what they do with her in avengers
Apr 9 2019,negative,horrible acting script and plotless
Apr 9 2019,positive,not the best but not the worst better than dark world and iron man 2 its on the same levels as captain america the first avenger
Apr 9 2019,positive,captain marvel is a good movie but ultimately has a lot of weak jokes and underwhelming action there are are some good jokes that really work but they just arent consistent enough throughout the film
Apr 9 2019,negative,welli liked the cat
Apr 9 2019,negative,alright here we go  so id like to start off that i wasnt a hater or anything in fact i was really excited for captain marvel when i saw the end of infinity war but then i saw the trailers and got a little worried that being said lots of movies dont look the best in the trailers and still end up being great so thats what i went into captain marvel hoping for unfortunately the movie didnt deliver    dont worry there wont be any spoilers in this review    im going to come out and say that it wasnt the worst movie ever but for a big marvel movie about the most powerful character in the mcu it was a major letdown    the main problem really is just carol danvers as a character shes snarky and rude and overall just very dislikable a lot of people might complain about the strong feministundertones of the movie and while i agree those shouldnt be in there that isnt why this is a 155 even if there were no politics whatsoever the acting just isnt good and carol danvers isnt a good protagonist    that being said there were some strengths to the movie nick fury actually carried a lot of the movie surprisingly well i expected him to play a major role but he ended up almost making up for carol danverss lack of personality    the story about how he loses his eye is a bit of a letdown but i can see how some people would think it was cute that being said it does undermine what he said in the previous movies about it when he said the last time i trusted someone i lost an eye    nope just completely throws that out of the window    some of the music was good although playing im just a girl by no doubt for girlpower just felt tacky the jokes were meh some were actually witty and funny mostly nick furys banter with her and the supporting cast but there were also a lot of jokes that felt generic and plain    that being said the choreography was kind of a mixed bad there were some scenes with absolutely excellent choreography but a few scenes with laughably bad choreography i cant quite figure out why the quality of the action sequences is so inconsistent but for whatever reason it is    also the entire movie is a plothole in the mcu and if youve watched the other marvel movies youll know exactly what im talking about    carol danvers is a mary sue whos rude and overpowered and undergoes no growth or development throughout the movie    its alright to have the hero start off as a jerk but somewhere along the way they have to grow iron man was a huge jerk early in the mcu but as the movie progressed we got to see him undergo some level of character development    but not here unfortunately carol is just as rude and condescending at the end of the movie as she is at the start and thats really disappointing because this could have been a good movie even if you dont mind the political stuff its just not good storytelling and i dont think brie larson was the best actress for this role
Apr 9 2019,negative,terrible acting terrible boring plot horrible action sequences and very poorly coreographed fights sub par effects and the main actress lacks charisma and acting skills for what i saw in this movie
Apr 9 2019,positive,very tonally inconsistent the movie failed to establish rules regarding her powers she can do anything at a moments notice without any training
Apr 9 2019,neutral,meh very bland and generic
Apr 9 2019,positive,loved it nice to see another woman in charge
Apr 9 2019,positive,i liked how the movie had an overall serious tone despite inserting a comical undertone throughout the movie particularly with marvels personality  additionally samuel l jackson is always enjoyable to watch
Apr 9 2019,negative,worst movie ever  worse than thor
Apr 9 2019,positive,another solid entertains movie from marvel great storytelling id say the only story flaw is how she got that much power by absorbing an energy core blast 
Apr 9 2019,positive,was an okay movie kind of a dumb story but cool action scenes but shazam was a greater movie in my opinion 
Apr 9 2019,negative,just another repeat boring color palette insert marvel hero name here movie its sad to see the lose of ingenuity and creativity in movie making nowadays  
Apr 9 2019,positive,captain marvel was a joy and a pretty awesome superhero origin story the movie was funny and filled with action it did a nice job of connecting infinity war and endgame i dont get the people that love this movie but i dont get the people with pure hatred for it it was a good film
Apr 9 2019,negative,it has more plotholes in it than the cheese and it is not filled with ideology of the creators but with what they think people would like to see being very offensive to men and spreading hate brie larson is perfect for the dramatic parts but when she has to do comedy is creepy i guess because she has not have lots of practice it seems they tried to emulate the recent success of wonder woman and mad max fury road but catastrophically and taking advantage of horrible happenings however it has some good things as goose the cat or some jokes although most of them are really forced
Apr 9 2019,negative,pretty irrelevant too op poor acting as well might as well just cast kristen stewart
Apr 9 2019,positive,captain marvel was a bad ass
Apr 9 2019,positive,i liked the movie not sure were id rank it in the pantheon of the mcu but probably top15
Apr 9 2019,positive,captain marvel is without a doubt one of the mcus best origin stories yet larson belongs in this role the way downey belongs in iron man and her chemistry with costar samuel l jackson is phenomenal the film also boasts a fantastic soundtrack and amazing visual effects all in all its one of the best mcu movies to come out ever
Apr 9 2019,negative,very slow until the end plus the character changes from comic book origin put me to sleep
Apr 9 2019,positive,brie larson was perfect in the lead
Apr 9 2019,positive,a little too much propaganda for my taste but it was a good movie and better than i expected
Apr 9 2019,positive,marvel has done it again another movie i wasnt expecting to like and they somehow nailed it outstanding
Apr 9 2019,negative,a complete flop captain marvl is simply put a bland superhero origin film with not much going for it brie larson gives a poor portrayal of danvers and is lucky to receive good support from samuel l jackson in a fantastic support role
Apr 9 2019,negative,she had no struggle the whole movie hardly any emotional expression nick fury was a completely different character from any other movie hes been in if marvel wants to make strong female leads they shouldnt be afraid to make them struggle and lose some as well instead of making mary sues
Apr 9 2019,negative,love the character just a poor selection of actor and horrible script
Apr 9 2019,negative,overrated and overpowered superhero flick heavy on agenda and light on good story telling
Apr 9 2019,neutral,probably the worst marvel movie i have ever watched
Apr 9 2019,positive,capt marvel is true to the process and is a fantastic movie full of entertainment and fun from the mcu
Apr 9 2019,negative,great visuals as always always a pleasure to see slj really lame use of the eye being lost in such an incohsistent way as compared with what he told cap not great acting the main character always seemed blah similar to the lead in the twilight movies
Apr 9 2019,negative,this is very easily one of the worst marvel movies falling into the category of thor dark world bad its essentially a character that got its own movie for yet another power origin story because they didnt follow comics two other characters of comparable backgrounds were introduced in one avengers movie which is more than this character deserved even jude law was poorly directed    i love comic books and comic book movies but i can honestly say that even though i saw this movie for free i still couldnt wait to get out
Apr 9 2019,negative,i wish it was better i was so excited to take my family to this movie we have been watching marvel movies together for years and love to take my daughters to shows that have female leads this was a weak movie story line was not as good as it could have been it felt like it was trying to be like a mixture between wonder woman and guardians and it was nowhere near as good i worth watching but save your money and see it when it comes out in stores not worth the 75 we spent to go
Apr 9 2019,negative,very boring i think brie is a huge miscast for the role of cm and should be booted out
Apr 9 2019,positive,sadly this movie was boring unlikable  the storyline especially about captain marvel and how she got her powers is shockingly stupid which is unlike the other marvel movies which have all been pretty good this movie would have been better with a better actress as captain marvel objectively speaking brie larson is complete garbage every emotion is the same facial expression she doesnt personify a real hero in this movie if she plays a major role in avengers end game it will be a enormous mistake
Apr 9 2019,positive,loved it the first time and the second time i saw it  a great introduction to a great character
Apr 9 2019,positive,as someone who didnt grow up reading marvel comics i found captain marvel to be a really enjoyable film that stood on its own  it was a good origin story that had just the right amount of humor and girl power the only issue i took with this film was the lack of genuine peril for the main character but i believe that is largely due to her comic book origins as an overly powered superhero brie larson was likeable and strong but people reviewing seem to forget about the supporting cast who were all excellent captain marvel is going to be a good addition to the mcu and i have high hopes that larsons portrayal of her character will play well against the other mcu characters
Apr 9 2019,positive,the mcu has been building to this moment   surprisingly on the heels of dc for the first time probably ever marvel have released their first film featuring a female superhero and the release was timed perfectly with international womens day   carol danvers the titular halfkree halfhuman hero is just what the mcu needs and just who the avengers need to take the big purple titan thanos down   however unlike dcs wonder woman marvel failed to give carol her proper and deserved first outing instead they made captain marvel as much of nick furys origin story as it was carols and thats where the film lacked   where wonder woman was all dianas story with some steve trevor thrown in for good measure carol was sidelined in her story by much more interesting side characters including yonrogg law maria rambeau lashana lynch talos ben mendelsohn and phil coulson clark gregg though coulson had a diminishedï 12 12 12though highly importantï 12 12 12role in the film   vers larson is a kree warrior who is haunted by memories she is told to harness her emotions by yonrogg because if she doesnt she wont be able to be the warrior she needs to be she is begrudgingly added to star force on hala to fight against the skrulls aliens who can shapeshift down to the dna level when talos captures vers he digs in her head to uncover the whereabouts of benings character a woman named wendy lawson who is the head of project pegasus on earth   talos digging kickstarts vers on her journey to discover her true identity as carol danvers a woman from earth who is strong powerful incredibly human and wonderfully kind along the way she meets shield and forms a relationship with fury and reconnects with her best friend the amazing and tough maria rambeau   the thing that sidelines carol in her own story is what sets up her story to begin with her amnesia and her search for answers was interesting but in many ways carol felt like a side character in what was supposed to be her big reveal   fury and talos and even yonrogg were key players all men of course in a way that carol wasnt without talos carol might have never realized how terrible the kree were without fury she might have never found the answers she was looking for without yonrogg carol might not be alive to be badass   here is a woman of incredible power who is made by all of these male side characters only toward the end does carol become the hero she needs to be and does captain marvel become the movie it needed to be   it is worthwhile to note that on earth before she became halfkree carol was a warrior in her own right she stood up when others tried to knock her down and she did many things that women werent supposed to do she had a beautiful friendship with maria and the two kicked ass when others told them no  its marias proper introduction in the movie and carols returned memories that makes the film finally click once carol is no longer fighting with a hand tied behind her back the audience and carol sees her empowerment flame to life which she immediately and wholeheartedly embraces   this empowerment happens with about 45 minutes left of the film   with the amnesia gone larson and carol can have more fun and its made obvious very quickly that larson struggled against the first two thirds of the film and the limitations of the script and the character when shes finally let loose larson truly becomes carol and for the audience its a delight the final fight in the film is a bombastic joyride that gives us a glimpse of exactly who carol is and how she will help the avengers defeat thanos   carol is the lynchpin of the mcu no spoilers but the final moments of the film show just how important she is and it makes me wonder why we didnt get her story sooner   captain marvel is still a treat despite its treatment of carol the film is hilarious jackson is still on the top of his game as fury coulsons inclusion is tiny as mentioned but we understand why fury went through what he did to bring coulson back after the avengers   theres a trust between these two characters and when theres a sequel to captain marvel heres to hoping itll be set in a time before the avengers so we get more of fury and coulson teaming up heres to hoping that a sequel will also give carol a story that doesnt put her on the sidelines and develops her character with a script that puts her front and center where she belongs and where shell truly thrive
Apr 9 2019,negative,doesnt live up to the hype
Apr 9 2019,negative,woefully bland and filled with clichã cs super predictable and just so boring the only grace is the performance from certain cast members
Apr 9 2019,negative,tries too hard to be special no character arc dull plot arc the socioeconomic issue it tries to address feels shoehorned in rather than feeling authentic and grand
Apr 9 2019,negative,its not great my girlfriend and i got bored as we got into the third act not the worst marvel movie ive seen but definitely in the bottom three
Apr 9 2019,negative,worst marvel movie in my opinion
Apr 9 2019,negative,mediocre superhero movie at best would have failed if not for the 10 years of the mcu to prop this up fury and colson were the only redeeming parts 
Apr 9 2019,negative,every character was likable except the protagonist there was a bit too much exposition where people just stood and talked hated the overlydramatic shaky cam during one of the conversations with the skrull at the best friends place had its moments jackson was perfect but it was mostly tensionless and i did not care for many of the bland cgi backgrounds they used for the supreme intelligence they made it appear to greenscreeny to me
Apr 9 2019,negative,if i could give it a zero i would i went to see it hoping that i would once again get to see an individual grow into the hero overcome insurmountable odds ie tony stark in iron man 1 captain america and actually grow as an individual instead what i got was an uninteresting film where not only did the main character not grown as a person but there were no real challenges fir her to overcome this movie disappointed me and my friend who accompanied me to the viewing she was extremely let down because of all the hype that had been thrown around about the ultimate female hero because she didnt even earn it everything she needed was always within her reach
Apr 9 2019,neutral,lackluster from story to performance one thing is clear brie larsons nonexistent emotions in her performance are propped up by a brilliant supporting cast
Apr 9 2019,negative,super bad movie after a long story line including heroes from all over the galaxy you would have expected something more from the on who is supposed to save them all 
Apr 9 2019,positive,captain marvel is a great movie at its core but there are too many wasted moments and too much misplaced comedy for it to be one of the best
Apr 9 2019,positive,underwhelming and a little stale
Apr 9 2019,positive,so well written and acted
Apr 9 2019,negative,made me regret thor 2  its quite boring and generic to be honest   very very disappointing when you compare it with the most recent mcu movies especially infinity war thor ragnarok and dr strange
Apr 9 2019,positive,my daughter and me love this movie
Apr 9 2019,positive,my first real exposure to brie larson and she blew me away shes fun passionate and uses wonderful facial expressions to bring energy a standard marvel movie but as weve learned thats rarely a bad thing
Apr 8 2019,negative,larson cant hold this company for the future shes completely bland and its probably really my least favorite marvel film to date with the likes of the incredible hulk and thor the dark world
Apr 8 2019,neutral,it was okay  really good villain and nick fury is always a blast
Apr 8 2019,negative,incredibly generic and boring and predictable brie larson is so wooden and after 2 hours i still have no idea what her characterpersonality was supposed to be i didnt care about the conflict because carol was so powerful the villain had no way of beating her skip it
Apr 8 2019,positive,fun safe intro to this super heroine fits the quality of marvel films in general not much else to say about this movie    an obvious choice for marvel fans on a lazy afternoon
Apr 8 2019,positive,i loved this movie i felt like it was a great origin story for captain marvel with a lot of action as well as some slower in depth parts where you learn about the characters i hate seeing people gate on the movie for stupid reasons it was worth the watch and i will definitely see it again
Apr 8 2019,positive,brie larson almost ruins the movie she is not a good actress 
Apr 8 2019,positive,i loved this movie the way brie larson played carol danvers was amazing im a huge fan of marvel comics and of captain marvel and i loved the plot if this movie how we know carol just as shes knowing herself to the point you feel conected with her she might be earth mightest hero but shes also an incredible badass strong and amazing woman and human cant wait to see her on endgame   one thing for sure is im happy that little girls are able to have this film as a inspiration and a character to look up to i wish that when i was a kid i had knew carol and all the amazing womens in marvel
Apr 8 2019,positive,captain marvel thrived on the mcu franchise formula  but it took a while for me to warm up to the character  this reminded me why kevin feige is a genius in bringing all these puzzle pieces together and why this works as a build up to the concluding chapter  avengers endgame this is for mcu fans
Apr 8 2019,negative,boring and uninteresting if you like the previous 10 years of marvel this is not the movie for you it feels very agenda driven rather than focusing on the characters and story they would rather push the narrative you never really feel like capt marvel has a personality or at least one that is interesting or fun she is seriously suffering from superman syndrome
Apr 8 2019,positive,i thought captain marvel was everything i wanted it to be as fan of marvel but not a super fan the soundtrack was a refreshing bit of nostalgia from the 1990s that i loved the action was there notably brie larson being a badass alongside an all time favorite samuel l jackson the haters will hate but if you dig marvel youll be entertained dont let the nitpicking nerds deter you the movie was great also its a must see if you plan on seeing avengers endgame and yes to the super fans thats obvious but believe or not some of us dont have lives that revolve around marvel happy watching  entrellennial     ps check out my podcast for everything from digital nomad advice to tax help for young entrepreneurs
Apr 8 2019,negative,i am a huge mcu fan but this one tries so hard to be feminist that it forgets to be a good movie
Apr 8 2019,positive,another episode in the marvel cinematic universe brie larson is a likeable heroine but i still prefer the valkyrie from ragnarok gamora or black widow noticed how i only mentioned female characters if youre a woman in need of a pep talk this movie is for you if youre not its still not bad 
Apr 8 2019,negative,honestly it is a bad movie from start to finish we did not see any character growth or evolution unlike her other arvel counterparts it was a complete disrespect for nick furys character the fight scenes were all over the place and it was way longer than it should have been we even considered on leaving in the middle of it
Apr 8 2019,negative,it was okay just not enough wow power tbh
Apr 8 2019,positive,it was fine had its moments the cat was great
Apr 8 2019,positive,finally marvels first female solo movie too bad dc beat them to it with wonder woman i was first hoping for a black widow movie but this completely blew my expectations but whos the villain i found the story line confusing and hard to follow but my heart jumped for joy when i saw stan lee after he passed away which made it my favourite part of the movie i cant wait to see her in action for endgame
Apr 8 2019,positive,the only problems with this movie is lack of character and personality in the leading role overall there was great themes and i feel they did well with not making it overly political and the pacing was very balanced
Apr 8 2019,positive,its good enough for one viewing
Apr 8 2019,negative,terrible movie   brie sucks
Apr 8 2019,neutral,the special effects the humour the inter woven lore and the plot are all great features of this movie that were executed somewhat perfectly the problem lies with brie larson and her role as a main character she plays a pivotal part of the move especially because this is a superhero backstory type movie that marvel so loves to do dont get me wrong marvel excels at this style of film i enjoyed captain america the first avenger iron man spider man homecoming thor and many others but this isnt a problem with the genre brie larson in my opinion was the wrong actor to cast for this move captain marvel should be portrayed by a powerful refined and intelligent lead but instead we got stuck with a whiny attention seeking failure of an actor that has to make everything onscreen and off a political debate this is a superhero movie for crying out loud i dont care about your political ideals thats the last thing that comes to mind when im watching a movie i just want to be entertained and that the problem the movie seems less like a way to entertain fans and more of a way to complain about how hard it is to be a woman wonder woman gives the same message that woman can be powerful leaders without the complaining bad acting and unrealistic scenarios not to mention that this movie tears away decades of cannon marvel history in favour of bland rewrites of previously good explanationsthe only thing this move really has going for it is good special effects the infamous and witty samuel l jackson and a good plot twist overall an okay film that i dont plan on ever watching again
Apr 8 2019,positive,this is my favorite movie in the mcu so far talos was it for me hes just the best character to ever exist so far in the mcu his love for his family reminds me of gamora and her situation just trying to save your family and keep them together i am a mother so that whole scene hits me hard i look forward to the skrulls in future films as far as captain marvel or carol danvers shes adorable and fun and emotional and i loved her sarcasm the movie was just outstanding
Apr 8 2019,negative,this isnt a good movie the skrulls are the bads not the goods
Apr 8 2019,negative,terrible it has been a long time since i wanted to ask for my money back production value was good story was not good and character development was not good either
Apr 8 2019,positive,thoroughly enjoyed the humor relationships and heart of this film i also loved seeing young fury and coulson
Apr 8 2019,positive,theres much joy to be had with captain marvel especially as it makes the most of its now retro 90s setting the deaging effects on jackson and gregg are nothing short of miraculous and it also has the most enjoyable pop soundtrack in a marvel movie since guardians of the galaxy it doesnt feel as focussed or as quickwitted as the best of marvel and danvers abilities arent always clearly defined but larson is heroic and empowering in her role and shes surrounded by a great supporting cast who are never what they seem
Apr 8 2019,positive,a very powerful movie about empowerment and not letting anyone tell you what you cant do brie larsons performance was stellar and samuel l jackson was hilarious as always i am definitely looking forward to her character in endgame
Apr 8 2019,positive,this movie was great
Apr 8 2019,positive,alright superhero movie poor acting from the main characters mindless action but overall not bad 
Apr 8 2019,positive,loved every second 
Apr 8 2019,neutral,over hyped agenda film on par with the bottom of the marvel barrel
Apr 8 2019,positive,this was better than many of the individual marvel hero movies i think the audience score is too low
Apr 8 2019,positive,it was decent enough
Apr 8 2019,negative,worth seeing to ramp into endgame but if youre wanting female power go rewatch wonder woman rife with continuity errors and flat jokes the characters are contrived and clearly lined out to propagandize several political mission statements this involves a lot of othering that many will be on the receiving end of and the double standards used to do so just make it worse
Apr 8 2019,negative,though the movie had great ideas the main actress lacked a captivating personality and the movie felt rushed i fell asleep during the movie until i heard a nirvana song that im pretty sure was there just for attention grabbing during the entirety of the movie i was asking myself one question why do i care about this story
Apr 8 2019,positive,samuel l jackson with another enjoyable acting performance brie larson was decent but at times her acting was cringe worthy the cgi actions scenes were bad ass and dope i liked what they did with the skrulls
Apr 8 2019,negative,brie larson sucked in the leading role of this movie where all the earthbased characters around her mostly samuel l jackson carry this movie there was no real emotional weight to the movie and the moments clearly intended to provide levity just created cringeworthy moments in an overall bland script sadly this is the first marvel movie i have truly disliked and if im being honest it was one of the movies i was looking forward to the most when the phase three line up was first announced overall this movie had potential but flopped right into the category just below thor the dark world
Apr 8 2019,negative,it felt terrible i even looked at my watch several times wondering how much longer i had to sit through it the character is not lovable and has powers so great shes at no time in danger the few characters i felt like hearing more about were nick fury and the skrull leader
Apr 8 2019,positive,theres a few fun twists surrounding the heros origins and the villains intentions but otherwise captain marvel feels like a slightly missed opportunity brie larsons tremendous talents feel squandered by limiting her to mostly staring running and fighting and its hard to differentiate the alien worlds and cultures from all the other marvel stories the star arguably ends up being whatever technical wizardry was involved with deaging some of the actors most notably sam jackson
Apr 8 2019,negative,not really good enough for a marvel filmi think the film suffers from miscasting and poor story telling
Apr 8 2019,negative,the only 2 good characters that are worth watching is sam jackson and goose   brie larson offers no character development and all her storyline is flat   no emotions are passed from her character
Apr 8 2019,negative,movie was very average as compared  to other marvel movies
Apr 8 2019,negative,the movie was underwhelming the acting was generic although the action and cgi was great the story made no sense the jokes were taken way out of line for an origins story i rate this movie a 410
Apr 8 2019,positive,brie larson is awesome in this 
Apr 8 2019,negative,i feel as if this movie was only okay its a marvel movie so i expected this to be a high quality movie with little to none mistakes after watching this movie i now wish that i expected a lot less so that i could possibly enjoy it more i have a new wish now i hope captain marvel will not be the future of the mcu
Apr 8 2019,positive,pretty good mcu entry not amazing but not bad either the majority of the hate its getting is very undeserved and is only coming from sad lowlifes this movie isnt perfect but its a helluva good time it sits nicely on the same shelf as ant man and doctor strange 
Apr 8 2019,positive,like most marvel fans going into ï 12captain marvel i had high expectations thankfully these expectation were mostly met boasting hilarious wit an intriguing story a charismatic performance from brie larson and some of the most thrilling visuals in the mcu this years latest marvel blockbuster has all of the ingredients for an exciting and enjoyable experience despite its few flaws overall ï 12captain marvel is a fun and entertaining adage to the mcu and an important milestone for women in cinema
Apr 8 2019,positive,looking forward for the next captain marvel movie
Apr 8 2019,negative,whats wrong telling the original captain marvel story disney thankfully wonder woman is dc or you would have screwed up that story as well i wanted to like this movie but it was bitterly disappointing half a star for the end credit scenes
Apr 8 2019,positive,the visuals are only sublimed by the multigenre directing the plot and the acting in this movie
Apr 8 2019,positive,i loved it ï 12captain marvel isnt necessarily my favourite movie ever but it doesnt deserve the hate its been getting at all it really was awesome the actors were great the story was really interesting the visual effects wonderful and goose is an icon as marvels first femaleled superhero movie i think its also very important for young girls and women especially and i left the cinema feeling powerful and excited to see more
Apr 8 2019,neutral,was good to watch once was funny but wouldnt see the sequel 
Apr 8 2019,neutral,movie was ok  pretty predictable was waiting the whole movie to see the mid end credit scene lastly this is the movie before end game need every clue bring me thanos
Apr 8 2019,positive,people are criticizing larson for her emotionless lack of personality throughout the film uhm that was kind of the central theme behind being a kree warrior apparently many of the negative reviewers missed that little nuance in the film overall it was a good performance and gave her just enough character development to seem realistic toward her overall character the film itself was decent though it did have a bit of a flat tone it wasnt the best of the mcu films but it was far from being the worst id watch it again and recommend it to any fans of the mcu 
Apr 8 2019,negative,brie larson cant act someone had to say it the fact that she has a career is unbelievable in my opinion her performance drags this movie through the mud the plot and action set pieces are sub par as well the movie doesnt even really tie into the next avengers movie wait for a dvdbluray release this is not worth the money to see on theatres
Apr 7 2019,negative,the story wasnt really good and im not sure if marvel just dropped the script the director didnt care or if brie larsons acting was that bad but her character really missed the mark i think they wanted capt marvel to come across as a tough bad ass but i just didnt feel it her relationship with her best friend and bf daughter felt forced 
Apr 7 2019,negative,65 laughed noticeably 3 times looks like a marvel movie some wonky cgi in some parts eh story can guess whats coming next one of the less memorable marvel movies it is better than thor 2 slightly
Apr 7 2019,positive,the movie was ok a decent popcorn flick with decent acting and visuals even though the climax seemed to be at the start with a lackluster end
Apr 7 2019,positive,its a decent origin story though it quickly skipped over her powers and quite simply seemed like a never ending game of cat and mouse as a a part of the overall mcu though it is not that important and is not as magnanimous as the other movies that were also origin stories
Apr 7 2019,negative,for all the politicized chatter it was marvels dryest unimaginative installment where everyone just mailed it in the most forgettable psuedocosmic candy colored super hero film since green lantern wimpy skrulls to boot 
Apr 7 2019,neutral,captain marvel is a film unlike any other in the mcu not for its female lead but that marvel studios crafted a movie around her that felt so unrefined i found the sudden lack of verisimilitude compared to the 20 preceding films absolutely jarring and was almost annoyed that it nearly failed carol danvers    for a film spanning the cosmos this one felt awkwardly small it was almost like a tv show in that locations felt recycled you could feel the soundstage desperately shot from multiple directions to try and show breath and scope but failing the illusion this was compounded this was also the first time that there wasnt an earnestness in the performances of an mcu film often the actors seemed to have of that tongueincheek winking at the camera type performance that has been long abandoned in these types of movies while ms larson shines in scenes with fury and particularly the rambeaus there are other times where it seemed as though she didnt know what to do with the character that said i came to embrace her by the end of the film and look forward to spending more time with captain marvel in the hands of more capable filmmakersby a pretty uninspired visual aesthetic that felt like wet concrete that said grey wash look did help carol absolutely shine when she adopts the red blue and gold colour scheme
Apr 7 2019,negative,not funny and seemed like nothing more than filler
Apr 7 2019,positive,i loved this movie i think some people were expecting it to follow more of the typical superhero format which is why they were so negative brie larsens acting has a lot more depth and nuance than we usually get im a huge superhero movie fan so im not knocking other movies or their casts im just saying that this movie deserves more respect than its getting the backstory is unique the shift from one set of assumptions to a completely different perspective made the plot even more interesting i like having another female superheroes especially with such strong supporting female characters and i think some guys just dont like a female superhero who isnt a sex object again not knocking other female superheroes because im a fan of theirs too im just saying that its cool to have this female version too 
Apr 7 2019,positive,awesome thought it was good and brie did fantastic
Apr 7 2019,positive,there is somethong to be said about how cliche origin story movies have become bit with slid performances by the cast all around and a funny cat this is one of new favorite marvel movies
Apr 7 2019,positive,very good and i cant see any of the criticisms that are the most popular in any of my many times seeing it
Apr 7 2019,negative,one of if not marvels worst movie
Apr 7 2019,negative,dull movie that made me not wanna watch coming avengers movie superhero fatigue at its best for the record the wonder woman was 100 points better out of 100
Apr 7 2019,positive,the movie itself wasnt crazy but the way marvel tied things together was great
Apr 7 2019,positive,i liked the movie a lot there should have been more information about her life and the bad guys but overall a good movie it is a feminist movie kinda but not all the marvel movies are the same some people think that she doesnt deserve that power but she does i think that brie lason did a great job it wasnt all that but its the script not the actor that should be blamed 
Apr 7 2019,positive,it was a fun movie i enjoyed it
Apr 7 2019,negative,seemed forced the cat had more personality than larson
Apr 7 2019,positive,no where near as good as other marvel movies but still a good movie story was interesting and seeing nick fury in his early stages was interesting and this is the part where people will call me a sexist hater brie larson didnt do a good enough of a job pulling off the part not sure if thats on her or the director but she seemed way to one dimensional in how she evolved in the movie despite how the story set things up 
Apr 7 2019,neutral,definitely not a good movie but by no means a bad movie in general it was okay the main thing that bothers me about this movie is how perfect carol is she never loses a fight never is proven wrong and is always the best which for someone who little girls should be looking up to being perfect isnt good i myself am a man but ive found myself looking up to wonder woman scarlet witch polaris these amazing female superheroes not amazing cause theyre female amazing cause theyre heroes now what did i like the cgi is absolutely amazing thats for sure and the score omg is incredible and also talos and goose were absolutely delightful all in all did i hate it no did i love it ew no its okay
Apr 7 2019,positive,i was so afraid after hearing all the controversy and tons of bad reviews that marvel had finally made a lame movie but i was so relieved at how good it was the movie held my attention from start to finish it didnt follow the sameold plot formula its surprisingly funny there are good action scenes there are multiple cool plot twists and it delivers a perfect message of empowerment for women and inspiration for humanity in general without being too heavyhanded while some issues barely keep it from reaching 5 stars i highly recommend seeing this movie i feel safe in handing brie larsons leading lady the reins to let her lead the mcu into a great new direction and i cant wait for a captain marvel sequel
Apr 7 2019,positive,this movie was awesome i dont care what the actors have said in real life brie larsonsamuel l jackson  the whole cast 100 nailed it the actioncomedysuspense  touching moments are all great her backstory was very interesting i loved every mintute of this film if youre the type of person who follows the crowd dont bother watching this film however if youre the type who doesnt  care about what other people say or think see this movie judge for yourself dont be a sheep dont follow the crowd dont miss out on something just because the loud minority of people keep going on about how they hate it when most havent seen it
Apr 7 2019,positive,brie larson not good  samuel l jackson very good
Apr 7 2019,positive,one of the most satisfying mcu movies humor mystery action likeable characters including one with four legs backstory galore and fantastic nods to other parts of the mcu
Apr 7 2019,positive,fantastic movie that has a great storyline and wraps together many things that have been seen in previous marvel movies will definitely be watching this one multiple times
Apr 7 2019,positive,forget the bad reviews it was great and we all loved it
Apr 7 2019,positive,i love it   i came out of the movie theater feeling powerful and invincible
Apr 7 2019,negative,led by an admittedly talented actress captain marvel falters under larsons stale performance as shes given no definite direction on where to take the character 
Apr 7 2019,negative,liked some of the 90s references all though they did feel a little forced at some times i had a really hard time with the cg as it looked really bad for a 2019 movie and really took me out fury was good and was the saving grace for the acting as brie was not funny and flat her character did not have any depth and i have no interest in seeing more of her as an mcu film it was the worst i have seen in a long time honestly it was worse than thor 2 but might just be me
Apr 7 2019,positive,decent storyline they missed on the build up to the movies climax 
Apr 7 2019,positive,the only thing this movie suffers from is bad writing every once and a while also captain marvels powers are just a bit too much for me otherwise it was a fun movie 
Apr 7 2019,positive,another good installment of the mcu carol danvers could have used some more warmth to her character she felt distant at times id say fury deserved 5 stars for helping carry the weight it was cute and funny and i will definitely buy it it just wasnt an mcu best it fits more in the mcu phase 1 type of caliber definitely hope the go further in depth with her story and character and bring her up to level with gaurdians thor and spiderman
Apr 7 2019,neutral,lackluster film the lighting was dark overall tone of the movie was bland forced comedy but thats disney for you only part i enjoyed was the movie explaining how fury lost his eye would not pay to see it again maybe on hbo
Apr 7 2019,negative,i hoped it would be good total let down
Apr 7 2019,negative,although this movie had a lot of controversy surrounding it i gave it the benefit of the doubt only to be disappointed im a big marvel fan watch all the movies this however was disappointing and made me want to not have watched it as it belittled other characters from the marvel universe nick fury for example was given back story in this film while in the previous films of the universe he is portrayed to have a dark past and had lost his eye at some point this film makes a joke out of the characters backstory i found myself pretty bored throughout the film and annoyed whenever they belittled characters
Apr 7 2019,negative,forced humor forced plot forced acting
Apr 7 2019,negative,it was so weird to see the mcu cannon be rewritten before my eyes in two hours
Apr 7 2019,positive,marvel can make anything good they can turn sam jackson 40 again when dc cant even fix supermans beard
Apr 7 2019,positive,she may be the strongest mcu female heroine but this movie gave me quite a bittersweet aftertaste fair depiction of the 80s for sure but it lacks originality in the development of the plot and the female emancipation besides i think the screenplay has a lot of troubles i give this movie a 3 out of 5 because im generous
Apr 7 2019,negative,disappointed  worse acting ever
Apr 7 2019,negative,captain marvel is a blend of light scifi and origin superhero movie that follows one of marvels most blandest protagonists through a clichèd and mediocre plotline this latest overrated mcu entry has similar tones and forced comedy akin to the original fantastic 4 movie and while captain marvel is full of action none of it can be concidered exiting or original especially after such movies as infinity war or winter soldier nothing can help carol danvers become a popular superheroine icon such as wonder woman not even a stupid alien cat
Apr 7 2019,positive,its entertaining but its not epic wonder woman was much better 
Apr 7 2019,positive,i thought the movie was great there was a few parts that dragged out because they left you wanting to no who she really was and what she was about based on the movies storyline and it became tiresome up until halfway through and then the movie bloomed and was fantastic i get that they have to explain her character before things truly go down but to me the first half of the movie really wasnt doing that justice it just was going but no true depth so i give it 3 stars because of the second half of the movie it was awesome and i know that the next time we see her with all her power and glory she will be kicking ass but on a side note i feel like the supporting characters gave the movie its heartbeat she needs to spice up her personality for part 2 
Apr 7 2019,neutral,its not necesary to see this movie if you  are fan of marvel
Apr 7 2019,negative,second worst marvel movie the character deserve more brie is a great actress but i didnt connect with her very bland and boring movie the only good thing about this movie is ben mendelssohn and what a way to downgrade nick fury character
Apr 7 2019,neutral,this movie is in no way a bad movie and definitely doesnt deserve the thousands of 1 star review that it has received but on the same topic the movie also isnt in any way a good movie compared to other mcu movies we have seen it ranks far below average but thats less of the fault of this movies inadequacy and should be pointed at our own expectations were used to seeing the phenomenal movies from the mcu besides from a couple poor movies in the past including hulk and thor 2 but besides from the that the mcu have had amazing movies but this movie in particular stops this momentum i believe thats the fault of the main character her self being horrible blunt and narcissistic multiple times while watching this movie i thought to my self how much i missed the humbleness of some of the other characters in the mcu another problem what the visual effects they werent bad and honestly compared to many movies outside of the mcu were pretty good but coming almost fresh out of infinity war i had high expectations another problem i saw was i found myself genuinely enjoying the time captain marvel herself wasnt on screen which i feel just isnt the vibe i should be getting while watching her own movie but im conclusion the movie doesnt deserve the hate nor the hype that is had gotten once you shed away the politics of this movie is just your average movie and my biggest hope is that his character doesnt stay the way she is especially if she is going to be the new face of the mcu and if she does stay the face im afraid ill lose interest in the mcu and i really hope that wont happen
Apr 7 2019,positive,loved it its everything wonder woman tried to be but couldnt 
Apr 7 2019,negative,probably the worst marvel movie since they started the whole cinematic universe the character had a lot of potential but they blew it
Apr 7 2019,positive,its fine not as good as the latest marvel films that have come out but ok the characters are solid the story is quite good apart from a few pacing issues and frankly mediocre action scenes it is a movie worth seeing one time but not  really a second
Apr 7 2019,neutral,i enjoyed certain aspects of the film and while i love brie larson and the fact that this film is the first mcu film with a female lead the plot and execution is simply average
Apr 7 2019,negative,film was ok but it is plainly difficult to watch a film when the actor is so vocal on any subject you would not enjoy a steak dinner if the waiter insisted on telling you how cows were slaughtered in order to make your meal technically you have a meal before you but the truth is you cannot enjoy it that aside its simply too late to be bringing in this character its like a double negative whammy shoved in your face
Apr 7 2019,negative,did not need to be made wife fell asleep and i just wanted it to end terrible story action was good samuel jackson and the cat was the only comic relief in the move wait for streaming platform to watch it not worth watching in theatres 
Apr 7 2019,negative,chase after chase and still slow and plodding
Apr 7 2019,positive,i loved this movie and my daughters were inspired by a movie about a female superhero
Apr 7 2019,neutral,meh i literally slept through the first half hour that was the best part of going to see this but at least now i am ready for avengers endgame 
Apr 7 2019,positive,this movie is fantastic fits well with the regular marvel franchise comedic delivery story is interesting suspense of when fury loses his eye is reminiscent of the suspense during hot tub time machine and the bellhop losing his arm
Apr 7 2019,positive,i enjoyed an almost a star trek next generation treatment of the skrulls including their plot twist
Apr 7 2019,negative,not as bad as i heard
Apr 7 2019,negative,this movie was pretty boring most origin stories are though i think the future captain marvel movies will be better but for jow this is a bottom 3 for me
Apr 7 2019,negative,you know why we loved wonder woman because she was a bad ass womanwarrior who didnt have to constantly announce shes a badass because she is a women no she was just  was badass not that she cant do anything because she a woman and men are stupid cavemen who sit around and when a girl falls 15feet we just scream and beat our chest saying your gonna die like they did in the movie or my favorite a mans daughter gets into a horrifying accident and he runs over and the first thing he says is this is for boys do you know how pissed that made me as a father to make a movie bashing men this way doo doo butt actor who played captain marvel n everyone at marvel and i blame marvel  grow up its not the 50s women arent bare foot and in the kitchen its one thing if you are doing it for a narrative to build compassion and relation towards the audience as well as showing the character had big obstacles to over come and she came out stronger because of it but you didnt  there was no arc she was the same from start to finish even in the flash backs oh wait i forgot she got more power at the end what an arc and dont even get me started on cat scratch fever smh lol i was excited for this movie and was servierly let down you suck for this one marvel please do better with the next captain marvel
Apr 7 2019,neutral,it was eh good for a popcorn movie but i dont understand where all the adulation is coming from predictable plot wooden performance from brie larson which is odd because shes a great actress and just boring dialogue great action scenes though and strong performances from jackson mendelssohn and gregg are the high points of this very uneven movie if you dont see it in theaters honestly youre not missing anything wait for it to come to streaming platforms in a couple months 
Apr 7 2019,neutral,captain marvel the character probably is the strongest marvel super hero but captain marvel movie is one of the weakest marvel movie
Apr 7 2019,negative,bland protagonist with no character arc meanders through boring plot worst mcu film to date
Apr 7 2019,positive,only for marvels fan 
Apr 7 2019,positive,amazing film from marvel
Apr 7 2019,negative,poorly written movie
Apr 7 2019,negative,i have seen many movies with similar stories recently and the action was a bit weak i expected more in short boring
Apr 7 2019,positive,good compelling origin story good addition to the totally worth a watch
Apr 7 2019,negative,horrible marvel is losing the market they created strayed so far from the good old days of iron man and captain america bring on the joker 
Apr 7 2019,positive,this was a great movie a bit of a confusing storyline but great acting special effects etc once you see this movie if youve seen the other avengers movies and everything related it all connects together some familiar faces and names make an appearance during the movie and in one of the postcredits scenes stick around to the very end because theres another a short but very funny scene 45 stars from me
Apr 7 2019,positive,i dont see why people have a problem with this movie it is fun and high octane 
Apr 7 2019,positive,another epic win from marvel
Apr 7 2019,positive,amazing movie one of marvels best i really loved the creativity used to do something different with an origin story great addition 
Apr 7 2019,positive,not bad nothing memorable either a properly average superhero movie
Apr 6 2019,positive,a medium marvel movie not as good as iron man 1 but not as bad as iron man 2 or 3 either
Apr 6 2019,positive,910  im not a marvel fan but i really like this movie
Apr 6 2019,negative,boring she is powerful at the beginning and a little more powerful at the end what happens in the middle is forgettable shazam was a much much better movie 
Apr 6 2019,negative,i hope captain marvel does in the first minute of endgame
Apr 6 2019,positive,pretty fun and shed lots of light on the origins excited for endgame
Apr 6 2019,positive,a great addition to the mcu timeline ties in well with the other stories and makes for an entertaining origin for both carol danvers and nick fury not a whole ton of action sequences but when theyre there theyre there stay for post credit scenes
Apr 6 2019,positive,fun movie but not great
Apr 6 2019,positive,im so excited to see captain marvel kick some more ass in avengers endgame    the best thing about this movie stan lee in the marvel studios intro and his cameo its such a wonderful moment  others not so much
Apr 6 2019,positive,if you sick of seeing super hero moves a good idea would be to avoid movies with the marvel in their name captain marvel made by marvel should of been a good clue  for the rest of us that enjoy a good movie enjoy decent humour enjoy plot twists and enjoy seeing super heroes blow up stuff then go and see this movie im going to keep enjoying them
Apr 6 2019,positive,really good overall however  could have cast a better capt marvel a little flat on acting
Apr 6 2019,positive,it was certainly a safe movie  it sure felt rushed and incomplete but when the movie takes risks it works really well and when it sticks to the old formula it falls flat  i blame the writers and directors and the fact that disney wanted to squeeze another movie in before endgame  the best part of the movie was bries performance and her take on carol and the feeling of empowerment shes bringing to the character  hopefully future movies will be better in terms of script and wont be a rushed product  i look forward to endgame and see what the russo bros did with bries captain marvel
Apr 6 2019,negative,poorly written character
Apr 6 2019,negative,the character is hollow and under developed i hope this isnt what we have to look forward to in the mcu going forward
Apr 6 2019,positive,loved it  dont listen to the people saying its a feminist agenda movie it honestly played like a normal superhero movie only thing i disliked was how a certain loved character of ours lost an eye
Apr 6 2019,neutral,kinda boring movie that doesnt really add anything to the mcu as a whole compare it to guardians of the galaxy 2
Apr 6 2019,positive,disliked brie larson as capmarvel its like watching your big sister get movie role of your life  she plays the character as your big sister shes not the alpha female  she should have been  expected 2b the saving graces characters colfury and monica rambaux the scientists not the warrior thats right the scientists known as marvel  our faux villian talos you know pretty much everyone who wasnt carol danvers i need and want my female heros 2b alphasnot jus a big sister do better marvel
Apr 6 2019,positive,a really boring superhero movie that doesnt separate itself from the other movies along with a boring lead and not so great visuals
Apr 6 2019,negative,one of the weakest marvel movies boring is a good way to describe it without the interesting development of the hero the story is not too interesting either it seems to me that the film was made as soon as possible to be able to make it before the premiere of end game generally meh 
Apr 6 2019,positive,awesome movie love the soundtrack 
Apr 6 2019,negative,not really great and not really interesting it was a great way to introduce why nick fury had that weird beeper in 2018 the main character was obnoxious overall with moments of cringe
Apr 6 2019,positive,sexism cannot break the sheer beautiful message that this film exudes brie larsons acting shined throughout the movies duration and once the 2nd act started she met the heights of tony stark in this film but in the beginning she was giving me thor vibes without much direction i think the movie still had obvious problems and i think her power could hurt her in the future since shes just so powerful and creating fair fights will be hard the final fight was more emotionally charged with less action overall captain marvel is a popcorn movie that stands out in the marvel universe
Apr 6 2019,positive,i really loved this film brought me back to my 90s years and glad to see another female hero cant wait for her come back in endgame 
Apr 6 2019,negative,just bad acting sorry
Apr 6 2019,negative,love bree larson but thr story is bad no good action almost fell asleep one of the worst of marvel they did it cause they had tomdo it and didnt care about the result looks very low budget when it could have been very powerful one of marvels worst
Apr 6 2019,positive,better than a lot of people give it credit for carol is not one of the most compelling marvel heroes but larson did a good job and so did the rest of the cast mendohlson was especially good as the skrull leader and i was impressed with the direction that the plot took with him action was good and so was humor also i liked the tieins with the avengers but wanted to barf when we found out what happened to furys eye that was an embarrassingly bad choice to go with other than that the movie is very enjoyable and people need to quit ripping on it unnecessarily
Apr 6 2019,positive,incredible movie the best origin story ever i liked everything the characters the story the pace the realisation the ideas a must see cant wait to watch it again and again o
Apr 6 2019,negative,i almost fell asleep several times while watching it and i cant see any good reason why this story had to be told except for the obvious fact that it wants to introduce a character
Apr 6 2019,neutral,marvel presents its most powerful superhero with the weakest script
Apr 6 2019,negative,disappointing and predictable the best part was seeing nick fury and agent coulson as they were in the 90s sadly the main character was hard to connect with i never really found myself rooting for her as i wanted to
Apr 6 2019,positive,exciting and inspiring intro to a cool new hero cool backstory to some of our favorite characters and a great way to tie together the other storylines in the marvel universe
Apr 6 2019,positive,great movie i enjoyed it and am looking forward to a sequel
Apr 6 2019,positive,it was worth 10 she is just not a hero she doesnt have the edge or it factor needed to be one 
Apr 6 2019,positive,great addition to the mcu aside from at times feeling more of a nick furry origin story
Apr 6 2019,negative,leave much to be desired for all the publicity that was given and fails to satisfy the public
Apr 6 2019,positive,brie larson not made for this role doesnt follow the original story line poor acting 
Apr 6 2019,positive,not as bad as the early reviewers said but not the best marvel has put out  would put it somewhere in the middle  basically do not listen to reviewers if you like that type of movieactressdirectormusic go see it  glad i went to see the movie now bring on the the real movie end game
Apr 6 2019,positive,a very entertaining and exciting filmthe run time pais of for the twist on the of the second actall the characters feel realthe twists are nice although unexpected and unpredictable it majes the viewers entertainedthe main protagonist is rellatablefurys quote i didnt believe it till i saw it is reminding me about carrolls cat that she is actually a monster with testicles in her mouth ï 12 12most jokes made me laughalso on the begging of the film i like that fact that you cant trust anyonelater on in the film fury makes fun of this fact by wanting one of the scrolls become a lookerthe self aware humor fits welli think this is a great movie making some major points in mcusuch ashow nick fury lost his eyehow the avengers gotten their namehow fury git his calling thigy for calling cm in the avengersiw post credit scene ecti recommend watching this movie before avengersend game anyway i liked this movie a lotand it might have the best post credit scene everbesides the swarma scene  obviously
Apr 6 2019,positive,a lot better than i expected  cool woman super hero  shes real
Apr 6 2019,positive,brie larson is a great captain marvel i loved it 
Apr 6 2019,positive,a very fine new addition to the marvel universe in short captain marvel is simply marvelous its got lots of humor way more than the usual marvel comicmovie which fills in the times between the action scenes a lot better with its twists and turns in its story it is a nice mix between life here on planet earth planet kree and other spaces in space i enjoyed it very much though there were loads of logical errors which are surely disturbing to the more fervent and observant moviegoer still i give it 7 12 out of 10 points
Apr 6 2019,negative,what an awful movie complete waste of my time
Apr 6 2019,neutral,saw this film last night  i am not well versed in the language of film critics but here goes  overall to me it was flat  i appreciated the lead characters backstory and tieins with the bundle of mcu films past and future but very little of the dialog or action pulled me in  it felt a bit like the many people who worked on it from sound to visuals to actors etc were going through the motions and didnt have a lot of passion for what they were doing like a car company that puts out a new version of a model that is pretty much the same as the version before  for instance a few shots of the lead character running from behind made clear that the actress cannot run very well or fast something that makes an action super hero seem a bit less super  im not sure why they did not notice that and correct the visual    i think a good critic is able to suggest what might have been done differently to improve a film and i am not a good critic  perhaps a better soundtrack would have elicited more of a positive emotional reaction from me  or perhaps the actors could have been allowed to take a bit more time with their dialog  im just not certain what was missing  i felt similarly about iron man 3 if that helps anyone the dialog just felt tired and formulaic    someone in the theater was actually snoring about halfway through this  i managed to stay awake and was pleased that i saw this film but it felt a bit like work needing to stay awake to make certain that knew everything i needed to know in preparation for endgame to debut
Apr 6 2019,positive,captain marvel is the 21st film in the marvel cinematic universe which focuses on our newest hero carol danvers brie larson starting out with no recollection of who she is right in the middle of the skrullkree war that is emerging along the way we find young nick fury samuel l jackson and carol having to work together in order to confront a much more personal issue once carol eventually finds herself we have a more open character which benefited greatly but the film itself isnt as jaw dropping as it couldve been its serviceable with some pretty cool action towards the end good performances from brie samuel and ben mendelsohn as the sympathetic talos but it is nowhere near a movie that completely falls flat
Apr 6 2019,negative,this movie was soooo boring i almost fell asleep for having watched the mcu for the last 11 years i couldnt not see this movie and it let me down this was a waste of the 12 dollars i payed to see this
Apr 6 2019,neutral,could not get lost into the movie great story and plot twist at the end though
Apr 6 2019,positive,good story excellent plot twist however humor was too dry and it dragged through the middle an average marvel solo movie but nicely sets up endgame
Apr 6 2019,positive,the movie was a bit rushed but still well worth watching  capt marvel makes a massive jump in abilities toward the end of the movie without much buildup or explanation  other than that it was enjoyable
Apr 6 2019,positive,the only reason i saw this movie was because it was in the mcu based on the score i expected a terrible movie i admit that i was wrong the comedy casting set and editing were great the plot however wasnt the best overall its a fantastic movie and i highly recommend it to any mcu fan out there
Apr 6 2019,negative,the story was pretty generic and the acting was bad i expected this sort of marvel movie back in 2007 not in 2019 i believe they made captain marvel way too op a character needs to have some flaws for the audience to like her
Apr 6 2019,neutral,the character was 1 dimensional at the start and was undeveloped by the end most marvel movies have a sense of humor this one takes itself too seriously a different more charismatic actress would have made a difference
Apr 6 2019,positive,its a great movie you should watch it
Apr 6 2019,negative,in an attempt to show a strong female character they decided to make her invincible  i really wanted to like this movie but both the character and story fell flat  it also didnt help that i felt like i was being lectured to about feminism the entire time
Apr 6 2019,positive,it was a fun movie but didnt quote have the same space feel as guardians of the galaxy carol danvers did well captain marvel not as much but i suspect she will be a lot more fun once she has other heroes in the movie to bounce lines off of they did a good job of bring lots of different characters and story lines together
Apr 6 2019,positive,i loved every moment of this movie
Apr 6 2019,negative,my biggest issue among many was brie larson had no charisma for captain marvel for a franchise that is full of characters that have such diverse and colorful personalities she really dropped the ball even chris evans captain america who is largely more of a serious character has his moments on screen where he shows more emotion and personality than carol danvers but can still pull off that serious heroic leader that keeps its all together
Apr 6 2019,positive,really good and quite funny will probably ho see again
Apr 6 2019,neutral,unfortunately this is a middling entry in the mcu the action is bland and the humor is good but its not enough to keep most people entertained for the whole ride however ben mendelsohn and jude law deliver memorable performances  
Apr 6 2019,negative,it wasnt really good like at all
Apr 6 2019,positive,its good but it can be better
Apr 6 2019,positive,i had to see this movie to get a background on the character its a good movie but it doesnt feel like a movie for the mcu the entire movie is captain marvel trying to figure out her past and 20 mins showing captain marvel becoming a hero and showing off the powers i think the movie could have been better if it had a different story i dont think this movie sucks it focused too much on carol danvers than captain marvel herself if i had to compare the movie to another it would be green lantern the movie was great but its the story plot that ruined the movie
Apr 6 2019,positive,what a great story love the storytelling throughout the whole movie nice setup for avengers endgame
Apr 6 2019,negative,im a fan of marvel bad acting disconnected story line id like those 2 hours of my life back please 
Apr 6 2019,positive,i like this film very well
Apr 6 2019,positive,the movie was ok  just that ok the acting is not that good in the beginning but i did not have anything else to watch so i paid for my ticket and sat down i give 3 stars
Apr 6 2019,negative,the worst marvel movie i have seen expected more from that movie i was excited to see it and got let down no real action and the fight scenes sucked and not to mention the main fight lasted 1min she learned to fly within 2 seconds and right after she flew better than a bird and went through ships smh she did way too much for it being her first movie i would not pay money to watch it again
Apr 6 2019,positive,i love most marvel movies and want more films with strong female characters but this was just ok just meh i felt like the film missed a lot of opportunities to help the audience connect with carol i really liked the imagery in the climactic moment of her rising back up at different ages of her life but it felt unearned when it could have been absolutely epic all we knew about carols past and who she was came from a series of montages of brief cliched images from her life how do we know she was cool and smart she flew a plane and walked toward that plane in slow motion how do we know she was fun and a good friend we saw about two seconds of her singing without sound with her friend at a bar how do we know she had a troubled childhood her dad seemed kind of annoyed when she crashed her gocart into a patch of exploding dirt and another character said she  didnt get along with her family if the movie would have let us sit with one or two of those moments and given us some unique character moments rather than just having them flash by that might have meant something but meh larson is a freaking oscar winner im pretty sure she could handle this stuff guys present day carol felt at arms length most of the time and it like she was trying to look and act cool or snarky rather than just being a real person now for a few other annoyances how does she not know anything about most stuff on earth like what a baseball cap is for example but immediately knows what flannel is when fury says lose the flannel they wear a lot of flannel on kree how come she can blow a hole through a spaceship with her plasma blasts but can only manage to knock kree soldiers over with them but kree guns instantly kill kree soldiers while not accidentally blowing holes in spaceships
Apr 6 2019,positive,it is a fabulous movie this is terrific funny family friendly movie the acting was very good it was great seeing agent coulson again
Apr 6 2019,negative,ugh  i wanted this to be good  but where is marvel studios going with this  im a huge marvel fan unfortunately dc did a much better job with wonder woman  brie offers the cap marvel character a mild connection  not like gadot did for wwdiana  you know a good superhero film is one youll watch over and over  this film doesnt have the draw barely made it through this one showing  ww captain america avengers guardian of the galaxy on the other hand ill watch over and over
Apr 6 2019,positive,i loved this movie ive seen it twice 
Apr 6 2019,positive,brie larson is a joy to watch in this film and i had not expected to enjoy watching her the story is a fairly obvious retelling of an origin story but nevertheless fun because of larson and jacksons chemistry i went and saw the film a second time enjoyed it more than the first time and now cannot wait for it to come out on blu ray the reviews once again seem to be people just seemingly wanting to bash a blockbuster film which is the fashionable trend at the moment go enjoy it for what it is please
Apr 6 2019,positive,i went to this movie with low expectations being dragged by my wife perhaps its bcause i was not expecting anything that i enjoyed it so much was not sure about the casting of brie larson but she more than held her own and did a fantastic job samuel jackson was great as always the movie also had a twist that had me fooled you had to pay attention as the story was more complex than i expected action sequences were solid and there was some good humor sprinkled throughout the film which i liked be open minded and dont over think this movie its not deep but to me provided a good story action thrills humor and likable characters and of course its set up for future movies which for me is something im looking forward to
Apr 6 2019,positive,i never leave reviews but it frustrates me how terrible of reviews this got from the audience no clue what peoples vendetta is against this movie definitely worth a watch 
Apr 6 2019,positive,dont know why everyone rated this so low  this was an amazing film great acting and reminded me of the first captain america film  storyline was original and entertaining 
Apr 6 2019,negative,it was ok  nothing special just tired of stressing characters without any heroes journey to speak of  its ok not to do everything perfect from the get go as an aside when your hero is all powerful hard to make an engaging story
Apr 6 2019,negative,might be good to play when you have insomnia
Apr 6 2019,positive,one of the best advengers movies 
Apr 6 2019,positive,amazing movie plot was unexpected has a good amount of humour goose was a brilliant actor
Apr 6 2019,positive,enjoyed it wasnt my fav marvel movie but the 90s references made the movie unique
Apr 6 2019,negative,sorry but the action was not able to save the thrown together story sad
Apr 6 2019,positive,mediocre movie overall  well below par for an mcu film great effects meh acting terrible screenplay
Apr 6 2019,positive,fun to watch and nice to see a girl hero
Apr 6 2019,positive,i thought it was good movie
Apr 6 2019,positive,didnt care for her acting to much but she is a badass at the end and cant wait to see more
Apr 6 2019,positive,great movie honestly had never heard of ms brie larson prior to this movie but her performance was spectacular as a father of two young girls im thankful for movies like this and wonder woman that can give my daughters a powerful female that they can look up to just like us boys had when we imagined being gi joes superman and other strong males im proud of this young lady and hope that she inspires my daughters and open up their imaginations
Apr 6 2019,negative,it was mediocre and the final battle was anticlimactic
Apr 5 2019,positive,loved this movie
Apr 5 2019,positive,i think all the hate must mostly be trolls fantastic movie even by marvels standards 
Apr 5 2019,positive,best marvel movie ever higher further faster all the way i didnt know what to expect going into this but i was absolutely blown away brie larson is amazing and the way they tie the precious movies from the marvel universe into this movie is amazing 
Apr 5 2019,positive,its not super original but it has a solid cast and follows the basic marvel formula so overall worth the ticket
Apr 5 2019,positive,the message this movie very clearly portrays both the experience of a superhero but also the experience of a woman ive been told that i would never be able to do things as well as a man told i shouldnt go into stem because its a mans world as a 15 year old this shook me and i gave up i have been told to smile more and then been called names when i wouldnt this movie shows a woman going through this and not letting it stop her and thats just as powerful as having fists that glow     the execution as a much as i adore the film and would watch it repeatedly it does fall into the same trap as most superhero films towards the end with the sudden gratuitous violence that characterises marvel showdowns and adds little to the plot however it did lead to i have nothing to prove to you which honestly powerful brie larson plays a believable character who struggles who is silly and smart and learns to overcome the obstacles placed upon her but most of all she shows that a character can change and adapt when presented with new information even if it hurts to do so being able to convey that transition is incredible     overall its a wonderful gorgeous film and it only falls short of 5 stars because of the superhero film trap at the end
Apr 5 2019,negative,marvel leaves you with a bland forgettable movie that has no form of entertainment
Apr 5 2019,positive,this movie is awesome i really liked the meaning it has and the flip it gets another marvel studios great film
Apr 5 2019,positive,i set the bar for this pretty low for fear of disappointmentbut this film far exceeded my expectations bri larson proved to be far more engaging and overall entertaining throughout the film than in the few snippets in the previews and although by no means groundbreaking with the formula or plot line it was a solid enough origin story while delivering the laughs and action weve come to expect from a marvel film definitely worth seeing in theatres to get the full impact of the action sequences
Apr 5 2019,positive,the major flaw with this movie was that it lacked a dense plot the first half of the film was kind of boring and slow but it picked up very well in the second half of the movie i recommend watching this movie to understand who captain marvel is during endgame    update this part of the comment is for rotten tomatoes are you going to do something about the review bombing still happening to this movie this was the first movie i have ever reviewed on your site and multiple times i have stated that you have some fake reviews from both sides of the audience mainly negative yet you proceed to delete my review again and again if you dont do something about the trolls still dropping the score for this movie like make verification codes that you can get from fandango or other theaters or add something like you need to have an active account on rt for 3 months then dont bother continuing on your reviews for future films im at the verge of ditching you for another review site that is more reliable and i know im not the only one do something about the trolls dropping the score for this movie and fix it for future films then maybe you can be a credible review site again    update 92619 there are still people revirw bombing your site fix the reviews or make it harder to review bomb in the future i will be using this to prove my point on certain arguments for now on
Apr 5 2019,negative,it was okay graphics were good but i really didnt like the story line movie ward not as exciting as they made it 
Apr 5 2019,negative,a lot of flashbacks that makes no feeling with her
Apr 5 2019,positive,thought it was great a bit better than black panther
Apr 5 2019,positive,this movie was absolutely amazing i loved it and brie larson is the prefect captain marvel also whoever says this movie is trash has no idea what they are talking about
Apr 5 2019,positive,a somewhat confusing mood or character of brie larson throws me off all the time with expectations from her being a good actress its a fight between being passive and smug superhero stuff is cool though
Apr 5 2019,positive,its a great movie for marvel first female hero
Apr 5 2019,neutral,while watching the film the only thing in my mind was how fury lost his eye and the post credit scene this is the only superhero film i watched that didnt excited me that much for the main hero
Apr 5 2019,positive,the latest marvel hero starts out with a clunky unimpressive narrative with cheap 90s references and not much of a arc thankfully the second act takes a turn for the right with emotional stakes and breathtaking action entertainment
Apr 5 2019,negative,whole movie felt rushed no character development a lot of plot holes huge marvel comic fan and i wont be seeing this movie again ever
Apr 5 2019,neutral,dont know why the critcs are praising this movie  lokks like they filmed it for the character introduction for the upcoming avengers movie
Apr 5 2019,positive,i enjoyed this movie quite a bit the beginning was a bit confusing and hard to understand what was going on but around the halfway point everything started to click and make sense the third act was awesome and fun for future marvel films that have a very broad and outofthisworld vibe itd be nicer if the beginning is more easy to follow and less abstract this movie definitely is worth watching a second time when you understand the concept and can sit back and enjoy awesome overall movie
Apr 5 2019,positive,great movie nostalgic 90s atmosphere and brie is a versatile actress in a great role
Apr 5 2019,positive,great visuals all around we got an intro into the kree and skrull war with a really unexpected twist it delves deep into shield history and is a solid performance in the mcu list of movies
Apr 5 2019,negative,as a big fan of mcu this one lacked everywhere man i hope this isnt the character that saves the day in end game
Apr 5 2019,positive,better than most of the reviews but not as good as wonder woman lots of action easy to follow plot soso cgi
Apr 5 2019,negative,this is my third time rating the movie i checked to see if my score stayed this timeï 12it didnt my shazam score didnt change or get deleted but here we are
Apr 5 2019,positive,now i know that some people have very nrgative opinions on this movie but here me out i really enjoyed this movie i thought the comedy was great the villain twist was interesting and shocking and the story was intreging brie larson is a great captain marvel and the deaging affects on samuel l jackson and clark greg is perfect overall this movie was gret
Apr 5 2019,positive,a solid marvel super hero flick  fun for the whole family and the cgi work done on slj was incredible
Apr 5 2019,positive,not that bad dont know why reviews so down on this movie was entertaining
Apr 5 2019,positive,my 8th favourite mcu film brie larson killed it as captain marvel portraying a sense of vulnerability and heroism flawlessly her interactions with fury put a smile on my face and a massive shout out to ben mendelsohn as talos loved it so much bring on endgame
Apr 5 2019,negative,this was one of the least mcu films ever made 
Apr 5 2019,positive,who ever says that this movie is bad there high
Apr 5 2019,positive,the movie was a lot of fun and absolutely worth seeing in the theater cant wait to see her in end game she is a total butt kicker
Apr 5 2019,positive,much better than the trolls would have you think  see for yourself
Apr 5 2019,positive,good not great but good    captain marvel is exactly the movie i thought it would be a fun little selfcontained adventure with subtle feminist themes that sets up carols appearance in the next avengers film theres nothing spectacular about it but im impressed with how well all the little pieces of the movie work together how well crafted everything is even if i cant exactly call it inspired    young nick fury and phil coulson are a delight the main skrull villain stole the show and the movie is filled to the brim with subtle incidental humor relying more on it then on quips which is a nice change of pace    the feminist message is also refreshingly subtle the movie never beats you over the head with the fact that carol isnt taken seriously by anyone outside of shield not in space nor in the airforce but its a persistent theme     nor does it beat you over the head with the relationship between her and maria is it platonic is it romantic who cares its two strong independent career women raising a daughter together amid a culture of misogyny and homophobia and i love every minute of it    as for captain marvel herself shes a divisive character like black panther before her she is the least interesting part of her own movie this is half because brie larson is a decent actress but shes not samuel l jackson and half because her character is very subdued carol spends half the movie in a fugue state suppressing her emotions while struggling with her tattered memories and the other half fighting in an interstellar war with all the calm and confidence you would expect from a woman who flew experimental aircraft for a living    and it works it all works theres something for everyone returning fan favorites a talented cast of character actors a positive message and a lead who stands out paradoxically because of how little she stands out
Apr 5 2019,negative,now that anyone could becould have been a scrull why should i care about any character
Apr 5 2019,positive,awesome movie  but good lord disney spread these things out a bit avengers iw follow up coming way too soon
Apr 5 2019,positive,brie larson is the very good actriz
Apr 5 2019,positive,captain marvel was a great origin story whos 3rd act rivals anything else in the mcu i loved it and cant wait to see how she factors in to endgame
Apr 5 2019,neutral,c brie larson was great but you can only do so much with a weak script
Apr 5 2019,negative,just could not enjoy this movie 
Apr 5 2019,negative,just let me start off by saying that its a great time to be a pop culture fan comic book fan all the different tv shows movies shorts and whatever else they come out with its an awesome time to be living     now that i got that out of the way    for me the move fell short it wasnt the movie i thought i was going to get i do like the concept of the story telling and wish they would have done more with it but it was a little bit all over the place at the beginning of the movie they tried hard to develop characters that didnt even need to be developed     the first and second act are a little all over the place but half way through the second act it starts to pick up the third act is all the action and the majority of the story is told here     over all its a very fun movie if youre not like me and have to pick apart every thing some of the best parts of the movie are stan lees cameo the cat and when carol danvers gets her full powers     stay for the end of for both post credit scenes you wont be sorry that you waited
Apr 5 2019,negative,ill keep this short since everything about this has been said already the movie is boring not well shot and none of the comedy hits where it should i cringed more than i managed a smile at this   there are moments that could have been epic if the build up work better and the visuals worked better with the music   the character didnt do anything for me and brie failed miserably with her performance even though she normally is a good actress so maybe its the scripts fault and not hers     all in all i am just really saddened that this is a marvel movie i expected more from the second movie that was set in the past they could have done so much more
Apr 5 2019,positive,baptism loved this movie on its own but additionally from a catholic christian perspective the scene near the end where she realizes the evil forces have been shackling instead of empowering her is a powerfully striking image of gods grace given through the sacrament of baptism and the call to cooperate with gods grace loved it and will be talking it up with my church groups
Apr 5 2019,negative,ok movie  doctor strange level nothing special seems a bit weird to throw this one in so near the end of this phase the marvel machine has been constructed immaculately every piece placed carefully over many movies and suddenly heres this extra massive cog  im sure endgame will make it fit 
Apr 5 2019,negative,spoiler warning they really did not get this one right while its a fun movie when ever fury is on screen and an interesting movie when it was doing the space espionage stuff it falls short in getting me to believe in her as a character cause you dont really see her struggle anywhere in the movie they also change the gender of a major character the original captain mar vell in to women who is the guy she looked up to and where she got her name captain marvel from that and they turned one of the most dangerous villians in all of marvel comics the skrulls in to a missunderstood group of alians trying to find their lost family and a new home made me disapointed
Apr 5 2019,positive,although the visual effects are astounding what you would expect from a normal marvel movie the acting is more comical than mature i wish the woman lead marvel movies could be taken seriously i really do its just if they are all written this comical i dont know if ill ever watch one like this again
Apr 5 2019,negative,terrible movie who wants to watch a superhero thats so strong that they never ever get tested in the movie at no point in the movie was she ever in danger boring to say the least
Apr 5 2019,positive,solid marvel movie well paced the friendship of nick and carol is believable the cgi was amazing not a perfect movie villain could have used some work in fleshing them out more would have liked to see more with the supporting characters such as korrak minnerva ect not bad at all though but not great just a good movie
Apr 5 2019,positive,my 5yr old daughter loooved it
Apr 5 2019,positive,a pretty great movie
Apr 5 2019,positive,fun movies good back story 
Apr 5 2019,negative,i was expecting this movie to be like the other marvel movies but i was super disappointed  while watching it i felt this strong feeling of disconnect and boredom  the film feels like its made by four different people who spliced it all together to beat a deadline  i did not enjoy a thing about this movie no not even brie larson  horrible  this is a bad sign for the future
Apr 5 2019,neutral,it was mediocre it was a pretty boring watch around the middle and the final battle was anticlimactic the entire thing was just super unsatisfying i loved the plot though however i would have loved to see this plot with an actually interesting character
Apr 5 2019,positive,non stop kick ass comic book humor  action
Apr 5 2019,positive,no where near the best film in the mcu but still found it entertaining
Apr 5 2019,positive,went and saw this week with my wife she and i are huge mcu fans and while this movie did have entertaining parts it was mostly disappointing carol danvers in the comics was a straight to the point character so ms larson did well no complaints on the acting the mar vell character in the movie was a terrible disservice to the comics in the comics mar vell was an intelligent military mind genius level on earth but not a full blown scientist of his species and the comic version death of mar vell was truly iconic the movie version was a cheat the man bashing was definitely there it would be nice if politics was left out of entertainment but the truly terrible thing is what was done with the skrulls they are the bad guys some of the worst in the universe making them refugees completely spits on an amazing story line from the comics  an ok start i hope for better in the subsequent sequels
Apr 5 2019,positive,amazing visual effects and great take on carol dancers story
Apr 5 2019,negative,captain marvel presents a much needed answer to a strong female lead in the marvel universe but beyond checking a box on a list of gender representation the movie itself lacks substance i found it to be formulaic and boring the villain was so predictable that i had him pegged in the first five minutes the dialog was so toneless i felt like i was watching a tv sitcom     this movie suffers from what many highly visual movies suffer from it presents a beautiful book cover to a potentially great idea but once you start reading the pages you realize its all an empty ploy to sell movie tickets to young female audiences
Apr 5 2019,negative,its a movie that would otherwise be just another mediocre marvel flick like thor 2 if it werent for the completely uncharacteristic star the only reason this movie is any good at all is the support cast but dark times loom for marvel if larson is to be the face of the mcu
Apr 5 2019,negative,by far the worst movie of marvel bad twists of script boring story the captain marvel was put as invincible when it is not so horrible as fury loses the eye finally a movie for children i am disappointed
Apr 5 2019,positive,i absolutely loved this movie its a great origin story and as a fan of the comics its everything i hoped for ive seen it in theaters six times and i have plans to see it again tomorrow
Apr 5 2019,negative,no emotion and a mediocre storyline
Apr 5 2019,negative,captain marvel tries to be something great but falls flat on face half the time  the movie tries to be buddycop movie the movie lacks character depth unlike other mcu origin movies  overall a very weak addition to the mcu
Apr 5 2019,positive,not badbut not good either
Apr 5 2019,positive,lovely movie  saw this movie once but im going to see it again  captain marvel is the strongest avenger without any doubt  she is the nuclear bomb  
Apr 5 2019,positive,an ok movie similar to the first antman movie i left the theatre feeling a little underwhelmed not bad but not good
Apr 5 2019,positive,another fantastic entry in the mcu not all that impressive and not anything formula breaking or terribly interesting but fun comedic typical marvel     sam jackson is always a win
Apr 5 2019,negative,very slow and boring no need to watch this movie to enjoy endgame
Apr 5 2019,positive,i love this movie  so great her powerful such a great
Apr 5 2019,negative,marvels second worst movie larson is stiff and uninterested samuel jackson is the high point of the film and this is only worth watching to fill in some blanks for endgame
Apr 5 2019,negative,not that great it was rushed
Apr 5 2019,negative,just plain blah   not written well  its captain mehvel
Apr 5 2019,neutral,i mean goose is cool and sam jackson looked great and i loved the twist on the skrulls
Apr 5 2019,positive,its always a little unfair to judge a film against its supposed importance but in cases like this its inescapable the mcu is a cultural phenomenon which shouldnt have taken as long as it has to give us a movie with a female lead character it shouldnt have taken as long as it did to give us a blackled movie either but black panther was in and of itself one of the best films of the series in the dc universe wonder woman was terrific so where does this sit     in truth i was a little disappointed im by now a little bored of the origin story formula and though this tried to depart from it somewhat the whole film seemed to lack a distinctive identity it tries to be about memory and occasionally suggests some of the same techniques that t2 trainspotting used to such great effect  but fails to develop them the whole first twothirds of the film is pretty slow going and jude law is out of place in a part that signals the movies core twist far too early the story more successfully touches on issues of refugees and terrorism  asking questions about who the real enemies are  but again this undercut by overly signalled twists     the final third is well put together brie larson is a fine actor who fills the role admirably and deserves a stronger vehicle than this there are some nice feminist nods  the destruction of the arnie poster early has been mentioned many times and is a powerful symbolic nod but the film takes so long to deliver what it needs to ironically given the films feminist position it serves better as an origin story for nick fury and his eyepatch and the cat of course is a fine touch     the problem isnt the character of captain marvel  i want to see more of her both in the avengers and possibly even a film of her own but it needs a film that doesnt try so hard to make me nostalgic for 90s music and a time when the otherwise excellent annette bening doesnt appear to have been made up to look like hilary clinton its not that its a bad film its just a letdown a disappointment a sense of what could have been when compared to black panther and wonder woman captain marvel needs better service than this
Apr 5 2019,negative,well marvel have made another generic origin story nick fury seemed lost throughout denvers had 0 character development and the cgi was appalling at times
Apr 5 2019,positive,a fun and great movie brie felt natural and lovable in her role the trailer really did a disservice to this a movie it was a refreshing difference from other hero movies as well which is important since we are getting superhero movies every other month
Apr 5 2019,positive,wasnt the best marvel movie wasnt the worst definitely enjoyable though dont listen to the trolls im happy it passed 1 billion dollars at the box office
Apr 5 2019,positive,i had fun with i wasnt head over heels in love with it but i didnt hate it either
Apr 5 2019,positive,full of action loved it 
Apr 5 2019,negative,boring easily the worst marvel movie ant man was way better 
Apr 5 2019,negative,boring and filmed dark and dreary this origin story is blah the cat is fun and its a cgi bonaza at the end
Apr 5 2019,positive,good fun superhero movie they dont overly complicate the story and the effects are superb
Apr 5 2019,positive,the movie did exactly what it needed to do as captain marvel is crucial to endgame it wouldnt do for marvel to just shoehorn a hero as interesting and powerful as captain marvel or lady marvel depending on the era without an origin story the movie is engaging and charismatic and doesnt fail to be allaround super
Apr 5 2019,negative,same old same a lot of uss but no mass
Apr 4 2019,positive,very fun movie i dont get the hate at all 
Apr 4 2019,positive,great movie and all of these people claiming political and feminist propaganda are just grasping at nothing the acting was good the setting was awesome considering it was meant to feel like a 90s movie and the story was good stop complaining about everything and enjoy the good things that are few and far in between
Apr 4 2019,neutral,it was okay definitely not great  but not horrible either
Apr 4 2019,positive,its good enough but its kind of cheap making her the strongest avenger mainly because that creates a whole lot of plot holes like why didnt nick fury call her during both avengers movies its fine though but it isnt anything special
Apr 4 2019,positive,feel super hyped after watching this movie cant wait to see how carol danvers interacts with the rest of the avengers cast great flick and worth a watch before endgame
Apr 4 2019,negative,this movie incompasses mediocrity not a hint of character building at all which led to not have a reason to care about any of the characters at all nick f was cool as always there is no reason or desire to rewatch this movie at all once was enough and i feel like i would be wasting my life to watch it again brie larson seemed to not have any emotional involvement and more of a why am i here attitude in the movie she had a level of arrogance that was offputting and its wasnt fun to watch
Apr 4 2019,positive,i really enjoyed captain marvel  i liked brie larsons performance as she combines humor cuteness and toughness with a lot of confidence  the skrulls were drastically different from their traditional portrayal in the comic books which made a more compelling and unpredictable storyline  one criticism i have is how they didnt show a whole lot about the training and life that was forced on her by the kree  it was referred throughout the film but didnt actually show much of it  overall another solid film by marvel
Apr 4 2019,negative,slow paced and predictable acting was mediocre also thought that captain marvel was overpowered she basically destroys an entire kree space fleet in 2 minutes she is seemingly slighly stronger than superman with no weaknesses semientertaining at best
Apr 4 2019,positive,great way to introduce a marvel character with great humor
Apr 4 2019,positive,average fun and forgettable viewing experience the film served more as a trailer movie of the avengers 4 rather than a true independent superhero movie
Apr 4 2019,negative,was an ok movie not a well know character for the ones that dont read comics not the best mcu but ok
Apr 4 2019,positive,very well done  typical avenger type of movie  introduced the character and explained her story well  no bashing of anyone no agenda except for wholesome clean entertainment
Apr 4 2019,negative,boring boring boring main actress was extremely robotic
Apr 4 2019,negative,mehat its most mediocre    i felt no connection with most of the characters the story dragged on to the point of boredom and it had poorly executed action sequences
Apr 4 2019,negative,marvel movies have taken a fall ever since the original iron man i enjoyed the early movies because it used the comics i read as a child and made them more robust and added unique story lines and a more professional finish now they are overproduced meaningless fodder to force you to buy the next movie that will undoubtedly be the same im all for women in new movie rolls but this was lame they did the lead a disservice by making this film so bland and empty 
Apr 4 2019,neutral,im just mad about the way nick fury lost his its so stupid
Apr 4 2019,positive,fantastic edition to marvel 
Apr 4 2019,negative,the movie could have received a three and a half for entertainment value but i could not find myself to do so because of some key elements one of the main reasons was that i felt as though the director was trying to push a political agenda in the movie that type of thing when forced could take one out of the fantasy world that one is trying to be immersed in while watching a movie     another thing was the fight choreography looked rehearsed and not powerful coming from any of the actors specifically brie larson and samuel jackson it didnt come organic it was kind of forced and it became evident  in the fight sequences     another problem i have with the movie was the depiction of the skrull that particular alien race is supposed to be evil but they kind of made it into some type of refugee type idea    i really think one of the biggest letdowns was the way nick fury received the scratches in his eye that was ridiculous i believe that was a missed opportunity to show something really cool    if the movie was not connected to the marvel universe then it would probably get c for some cool visuals and some okay action
Apr 4 2019,negative,i honestly wasnt hoping for much a fun marvel movie that i could understand and get ramped up for the next avengers movie what i got was a lukewarm buddy cop film with disjointed action seans the plot is full of holes and it looked like a phase one film i just hope this doesnt carry over
Apr 4 2019,negative,justvery poorly made
Apr 4 2019,positive,a fun exciting and mostly self contained marvel blockbuster that serves its heroine quite well
Apr 4 2019,negative,captain marvel proves yet again how outoftouch hollywood is with women by creating a shallow character whose only trait is rudeness and whose only desire is to kick butt this movie only exists because wonder woman proved to the world that girls actually make money sorry marvel its too little too late
Apr 4 2019,positive,awesome action packed
Apr 4 2019,negative,wow one of the worst movies ive ever seen not much else to say
Apr 4 2019,positive,is it dark night good no is it fantastic 4 bad hell no its the generic mcu origin story but i found it more entertaining than thors origins nice 90s nostalgia
Apr 4 2019,positive,every young girl should watch this movie they should all know that when you get knocked downyou get back up and dont let others tell you that you cant because of your gender the future is female   nice cameo by stan lee
Apr 4 2019,negative,not happy with this movie was expecting more from the actors
Apr 4 2019,negative,good picturing cool characters but it just didnt feel marvel enough cheap jokes plot holes overall a decent movie at best
Apr 4 2019,negative,overall somewhat entertaining the lack of character development was obvious throughout the movie and please stop with the politics and propaganda on our movies thank you
Apr 4 2019,negative,wasnt that good of a movie  i really tried to like it 
Apr 4 2019,positive,i truly honestly did not love this movie it was just okay
Apr 4 2019,positive,one of the best marvel movies yet 
Apr 4 2019,neutral,captain marvel was okay its biggest problem is that cap marvel wasnt that great of a character and the only thing that gets people to see marvel movies is that usually their characters it was fine
Apr 4 2019,negative,if marvel wanted this character to truly count they should have introduced her earlier movie was forced and average felt like a dc movie
Apr 4 2019,positive,great movie and amazing addition to the marvel and to any who says brie larsons acting is emotional if you have read the comic books the krees are known to be emotionless and carol is half kree
Apr 4 2019,positive,great movie cant wait for endgame
Apr 4 2019,neutral,standard marvel movie lacking in uniqueness compared to others
Apr 4 2019,negative,i feel asleep 15 minutes in i think it was the colors and the soundtrack incredibly dull
Apr 4 2019,positive,truly enjoyed the film from beginning to end there were a fair amount of twists within the plot line i think whether you know comics or not that this is a wonderful film to check out 
Apr 4 2019,negative,arrogant selfcenterd egotistical haughty vain are ways to describe this character ww did it better is all
Apr 4 2019,negative,for me is one of the worst movie of the ucm
Apr 4 2019,negative,only film ive ever walked out of boring generic story line poorly written and poor execution of the character by brie
Apr 4 2019,negative,brie larsons performance was lackluster and she failed to demonstrate the presence of a true hero  there was no character arc for her character and thus the movie felt very flat to me  this should have been a better movie  plus all the bits about women vs men was distracting use of no doubts just a girl for one of the big fight scenes was lame as hell and i love that song
Apr 4 2019,neutral,what should have been a thoroughly enjoyable film was diminished by bri larsons lackluster performance of the the main character making it difficult to invest in the story
Apr 4 2019,negative,bleh meh huh pretty flashy but ultimately empty it is hard to see why the film needed to exist it feels like a 200 million voice over the acting feels like it was literally phoned in brie larson is a good actor but unfortunately this wont convince anyone of that fact perhaps it was the writers writing her character wrong but snarky happygolucky devilmaycare is a lot different than plastic disinterested moody 
Apr 4 2019,positive,another great marvel movie very excited to see what the russos do with danvers in endgame would highly recommend everyone watch this movie
Apr 4 2019,negative,the movie was quite bland because the viewer could never get connected to the film there was no emotional arc in the story whatsoever the moment she is reunited with her friend is botched and having to kill her only friends she remembers doesnâtmt seem difficult additionally brie larson delivers everything with an unchanging face and brutal arrogance
Apr 4 2019,positive,one of the best marvel movies ever easily one of top 5 superhero movies till date crossed 1 billion by the time im typing highest grossing and best female superhero movie ever xd
Apr 4 2019,positive,a little slow at first but overall great film humor was very likable and fighting scenes were amusing 
Apr 4 2019,positive,a good movie but in my opinion it doesnt reach marvels normal standards
Apr 4 2019,positive,packed with action humor and visual thrills captain marvel introduces the mcus latest hero with an origin story that makes effective use of the franchises signature formula it rises to the occasion with strong performances and with its directors willingness to slow down and take their story seriously balancing humor action and exposition in a carefully calibrated package watching danvers story play out complete with boggling plot twists and a scenestealing friendly feline is hugely entertaining captain marvel the first marvel adaptation both to star a woman and to be codirected by a woman what a great choice this turned out to be  a satisfying standalone launch for marvels latest superhero combines scifi action with 90s nostalgia overcoming minor stumbles it ultimately soars
Apr 4 2019,negative,my wife slept on the movie
Apr 4 2019,negative,too many plot holes complete disregard for the source material absolutely ridiculous retconning moments that killed this movie for me
Apr 4 2019,positive,my niece and i were both hyped to see this movie and left a little disappointed i was hoping for more from marvels first female led superhero movie i guess i was hoping it would have an engaging plot and action like wonder woman it was a good movie but i wanted them to give us a great movie like captain america the black panther and the avengers maybe now that they have laid out the origin movie the next one can be better
Apr 4 2019,negative,weak story all she seemed to learn was men are bad i cant wait to see how that works as a character trait in later mcu movies
Apr 4 2019,negative,without special effects there is no substance to this film so disappointing
Apr 4 2019,positive,captain marvel is a fun well thought out movie with good comedy an inspiring story and a great plot twist that builds the mcus lore over all its not what the trailers show the movie and is a fun ride all the way
Apr 4 2019,positive,definately one of the weaker movies within the mcu but i am willing to give captain marvel another go in endgame
Apr 4 2019,positive,some of the parts were slow but people arent focusing on what really made this film a blockbuster the main character lacks emotion but thats her personality and i accept who she is
Apr 4 2019,positive,definately one of the weaker movies within the mcu but i will give captain marvel another chance in endgame
Apr 4 2019,positive,captain marvel in most of the times is very marvelous    marvel movies always rides on high expectations and so was the case with its first female superhero filmand captain marvel perfectly meets the expectations typical marvel action and humour blend makes the film an entertaining watchbut captain marvel has some plot faults toomany a times it looks lifeless and kind of exxagerationthe plot with extra dose of action sequences but when its marvel it works absolutely fine    acting wise brie larson carries out the responsibility of leading the film perfectlyand for samuel jackson nothing has to be saidhe has times and times again proved his worthother casts including ben lee pace and lashana completes the acting brilliance offered by the film    captain marvel is yet another high on vfx swashbuckler from telje mcu and thus the visual effects are part excellence    above all the film is another landmark form the evergrowing mcu empirethe movie has taken female led superhero films in hollywood in a new level  faster and higher
Apr 4 2019,negative,horrible origin story
Apr 4 2019,negative,its not terrible my expectations are just a lot higher for marvel movies this is definitely one of the lower tier ones in terms of story and character development
Apr 4 2019,neutral,i went to see this two weeks after it opened in spite of the negative reviews from users i went in with an open mind and i wanted to judge this on its own merits and not the opinions of others in reality it wasnt a horrible film its primary weakness is the simple fact that brie larson is completely one dimensional and in the end is just plain boring marvel always made their characters interesting by making them quirky and relatable captain marvel as a character is neither of those things she is instantly forgettable and thoroughly unlikable the cat was great
Apr 4 2019,negative,the supporting cast was good but there was no conflict and it just wasnt very good
Apr 4 2019,negative,rather disappointing
Apr 4 2019,negative,kind of disappointing marvel could have done better
Apr 4 2019,neutral,to be honest i expected the film to be worse than it actually was brie larson wasok she wasnt terrible but she wasnt anything to write home about but what i really didnt like was how they made fury into a clown samuel l jackson is of course very funny and hes funny as fury but he was always a badass and in this movie he was a bumbling clown and the big reveal about how fury lost his eye a gag a joke a complete disappointment but the story was good and i liked the skrulls of course the brit was the evil villain but that is to be expected what i dislike but this is not just a problem of captain marvel is when a hero is godlike this loses all excitement they managed to control this with thor but captain marvel seems just too overpowered the same as superman is and i dont mean just the films but the comics as well which makes it then pretty bring especially as they both are absolutely good with no real personality traits 510 for me
Apr 4 2019,positive,i am a big fan of the comic book character i really liked the movie the reason its not 5 stars even after seeing it twice is this ya know when your watching a movie there is that one scene that was done so well either by the acting special affects or sound this one had some great ones but it wasnt like amazing blow your socks off kind of scene or sequence of scenes i guess i needed one of those to help push it over the edge to make it a 5 star film for me so for me a film i really enjoyed and will add to ever growing video collection i do feel it was a great warm up act to what we are all waiting for the new avengers movie
Apr 4 2019,positive,captain marvel receives way to much flack in my opinion the show was fantastic and had very minimal if any feminist undertones so the opinionated biased reviewer shouldnâtmt  just base it off supposed feminist brie larson but the movie itself and just based off the movie it was a dang good show
Apr 4 2019,positive,great soundtrack great cat and more of an insight into the marvel universe but thats about it
Apr 4 2019,positive,some of the action sequences are somewhat formulaic you dont really notice it because the chemistry between the actors is a pleasure to behold and its all just so much fun
Apr 4 2019,positive,i loved almost everything except one scene or another
Apr 4 2019,positive,this film is like every other marvel films but with a woman in the main role it is funny have action and a basic history i dont know why the hate
Apr 4 2019,positive,great marvel movieits follows the formula but is good
Apr 4 2019,neutral,poor choice of actor for the main character
Apr 4 2019,negative,seemed a little like a phase one marvel movie
Apr 4 2019,positive,good but could be better
Apr 4 2019,positive,it wasnâtmt the best but i genuinely enjoyed myself despite going in expecting it to be bad itâtms definitely worth the watch
Apr 4 2019,positive,the shorty is quite confusing and the first half was dreadful bust it came to life in the second half
Apr 4 2019,positive,very entertaining fun and easy to watch is not the best of marvel but is one of the best in my opinion with captain america  guardians of the galaxy and ant man i honestly dont understand how aquaman with all the flaws that it had has gotten better reviews than this movie for fans its certainly not bad as some people o most people say it was i frankly dont think that the people who said that actually saw the movie o mean that that is not that good or the best i can agree with but that it was bad o that brie larson wasnt a fit for the role i dont i think that what actually could have happened is that most people stick with what the first trailer sold but it wasnt actually how the movie ended up being is just that the trailer mostly show the first parts of the movie and the way that captain marvel was trained to be a cold and emotional controlled soldier but that quickly change
Apr 4 2019,positive,its such a convenient time to introduce a supposedly key character to avenge the world in the upcoming avengers endgame dont take me wrong this is a marvel film alright  fun and jampacked with easter eggs     of all the scenes the one that ive found to have the most filmlike look is the scene after carols flashback at marias place the rest just look too digital albeit with plenty of cgi     in the kree spaceship where yon rogg and his team confronted carol is somewhat similar to the end of agents of shield s05e21 scene where daisy was talking to taryan kasius in an alternate reality    ive heard people making comparisons of capt marvel with wonder woman ww for me i feel that they are definitely two very distinct characters from very different place and time meaning we shouldnt judge how diana was like a fish out of water when she visited london whereas carol was right at home when she reached c53 aka earth     think about it diana was raised in themyscira and have been living there all her life without any contact from the outside world so it explains why she behaved awkwardly and took the time to adapt to the world of man     however carol is different as shes born on earth and have only been residing on krees homeworld hala for around six years hala is a very technologically advanced place thus it makes sense for her to be able to utilise earths equipment with little to no learning needed    furthermore ive found that capt marvels feminism theme is a tad bit too in our face the element is done a lot more subtly in ww that i didnt notice it in capt marvel its way too obvious not to feel it at all    hopefully she really has an important role in endgame and it would be interesting to see her appearance in future mcu titles for sure time to get hyped for endgame quickly purchase your quantum realm suit and book your tickets now
Apr 4 2019,positive,not bad but a weaker installment in the mcu that really didnt bring much to the praised movie franchise except for the post credit scene but the cji on jackson and greggs face are truly amazing and a little change of pace for samuel l jackson as a comic relief but larsons performance is very cheesy and does not deliver on a emotional punch
Apr 4 2019,positive,my sisier brie larson does awesome job playing as captain marvel
Apr 4 2019,negative,worst marvel offering yet very disappointing
Apr 4 2019,positive,saw it 3 times very enjoyable and empowering
Apr 4 2019,positive,i saw it last night and i love it marvels best origin movie samuel l jackson and brie larson were a perfect duo i am looking forward for  captain marvels next adventure
Apr 4 2019,negative,this is one of the most average movies ive ever seen no im not trying to troll this is how i genuinely feel i am a big fan of marvel the whole cinematic universe idea is great however captain marvel doesnt do the job the story doesnt do anything special and the acting is way below average i took moments that were supposed to be serious as a joke because of the acting if i were you i would skip this and just wait for endgame
Apr 4 2019,positive,a fun addition to the mcu with some humor and heartfelt moments but falls flat in developing a more intriguing character
Apr 4 2019,positive,i was expecting the worst because of the reviews online and the disappointed feedback of some of my friends but i eventually watched it because i needed to understand the whole plot of avengers end game  and im actually positively surprised yes its mostly predictable but some little twists kept things interesting i just wish that the trailers didnt reveal as much because yeah it kind of ruined the fun as for the cheap feminism that the movie has been accused of id like to point out the fact that its all set during the 90s and back then womens position in society wasnt so comfortable and its isnt on some aspects so yeah it was kinda annoying sometimes a bit overplayed especially that part at the end with jude law but otherwise it was pretty accurate  overall id recommand the movie 
Apr 4 2019,positive,the movie was amazing from start to end not perfect but what movie is the tone was perfect story was aesyto follow canâtmt wait to see more captain marvel
Apr 4 2019,positive,not the strongest marvel film by nay means but not bad  certainly not as bad as the reviews written by people who hadnt actually seen it yet would have you believe
Apr 4 2019,neutral,this is the green lantern of the marvel universe nonsensical plot and stock characters its worth renting if you are a marvel fan but othwise skip it 
Apr 4 2019,positive,loved the movie best superhero movie ive seen in a long while   love the laid back tempo and dialogue also great actions scenes and a good scenario ive seen the movie twice 2d and 3d
Apr 4 2019,positive,i like the movie but the fight scenes needed work
Apr 4 2019,negative,im a female marvel fan by all means this movie should have been for me i dont go into movies wanting to hate them because at the end of the day i dont want to waste my time i walked out of the theater wishing i had done anything else the obvious point brie larson is a complete mess and her character is incredibly boring i dont think shes a good actress to begin with but she could have done better than this the plot is overall pretty predictable and the only good fight scene in the movie was shown off in like every trailer this is the most generic bland superhero movie i think ive ever seen the cat was alright i suppose since everyone loves him but definitely not worth seeing the movie for the marketing for this movie was also terrible by every means sad this made money because it feels like marvel is just making movies for the sake of making movies recently i loved antman and the wasp but captain marvel aint a good movie skip it
Apr 4 2019,positive,i thought it was an amazing movie overall there were a few things that bugged me like i thought they tried too hard to be funny but overall the cgi was amazing and it was a great movie i would definitely recommend it 
Apr 4 2019,negative,the movie was meh slow throughout the middle but good fighting scenes
Apr 4 2019,negative,it was a so boring and uninteresting movie for a marvel series everything is so normal just a nomal superhuman with a normal power and normal plotnormal actions it is even not better than man of steel     the biggest mistake of this film is gave her name as captain marvel she doesnt deserve that name she didnt lead the people well and she didnt anything for get the name but serve the country     every marvel characters solo movies has unique and very heart touching story that audiences can sympathize do captain marvel has that no
Apr 3 2019,neutral,ehhhh the movie was pretty enjoyable sam jackson was amazing as always lashana lynch was great as maria ben mendelshon was without a doubt my favorite part of this movie and akira akabar was amazing and i hope we see more of monica rambeau in the future of the mcu so captain marvel the most powerful hero in the mcu to date slated to become the new leader face of the mcu played by an well known and very talented actress who just seemed like she didnt care dont get me wrong brie larson was in no way horrible she held her own and had a few scenes that i really enjoyed but if she was not surounded by a cast of amazing actors this movie wouldve absolutely been much lower on my personal mcu ranking i honestly feel like this is not bries fault i dont think the writing for her character was up to par with the other mcu heros we love i loved the skrulls and the way that plot played out and the movie its self was fun but i hate to say it just felt like the only motivation for making this movie was to explain something that will happen in avengers endgame or the future mcu which is fine i was just hoping this movie would truely stand on its own i was honestly very excited to see this movie going in and left with the only real memory of the movie being when i spilled my popcorn on my friend overall not bad just doesnt stack up to most of the other mcu movies
Apr 3 2019,negative,saw it wouldnt watch it again when it comes on tv
Apr 3 2019,positive,i think the movie is fine but not as  good as the others
Apr 3 2019,positive,this was movie was really amazing the plot the action and brie larson was a pretty good as captain marvel 
Apr 3 2019,negative,missed the mark in every way marvel is totally and completely out of touch with its true audience 
Apr 3 2019,negative,ok i just had to write a review of this movie because it is one of the worst out of many ive seenthe start of the movie was fairly goodgreat sa and openingbut after that it was just mushthe writers really messed up on this oneit was all over the place and had me asking my daughter what the hell happenedmy daughter and i really loved wonder women but this one just didnt really hit the mark
Apr 3 2019,positive,an entertaining entry into the mcu captain marvel  brings on 90s nostalgia and a killer soundtrack over fun action sequences character development is lacking compared to its mcu peers and the plot at times is predicable its very middle of the pack as marvel films go
Apr 3 2019,positive,it was a very good superhero film to see
Apr 3 2019,negative,i was very  disappointed in this movie and i almost lost my urge to see avengers endgame the story was very bland main character  acting was very bland the film was very agenda driven and they forgot  thay acully had to make a movie very cheesy  and corny  had zero emotions throughout  the movie worst movie from marvel forced fun just didnt work
Apr 3 2019,negative,brei larson was terrible emotionless and cold of all the amazing actresses in hollywood brei larson could be one of the absolute worst choices to lead the franchise the only reason captain marvel made as much money as it did is that we were forced to watch it because of its placement between infinity war and endgame put aside her real life abnoxious personality she brought nothing to the role and is not talented enough to take over the franchise the character was shoved down our throats and i personally hope that they end her contract and bring elizabeth olsen back to the front or atleast introduce an interesting female character with one of the many extremely talented actresses out there to take the franchise
Apr 3 2019,negative,retcons the mcu to be cute
Apr 3 2019,negative,saw today  its a couple of hours that i wish i had spent doing just about anything else
Apr 3 2019,negative,not very good feels like it doest have anything to do with endgame
Apr 3 2019,positive,really high quality movie as expected from the marvel team if you liked previous marvel movies you will not be disappointed on this one    we got a lot of fear mongering about leftist ideology but while i saw a few nods and virtue signals throughout the movie it was really well inserted on the movie leading to some really good moments     one of the main alien races on the movie was really ugly not a cool ugly  just plain ridiculous    the actors were really good i heard a lot of criticism about the main character but while i see that she does not display her emotions much her emotions are just more subtle and realistic compared to the hyper expressive ones that we are used to    i really dislike the origin of her powers and the powers themselves they are beautiful but annoyingly vague and weird     the humor was there and most of it was very good with some of them being really ridiculous like everything involving the cat     if you are a nitpicky type you will find a few incoherences on the plot here and there
Apr 3 2019,negative,very boring for a marvel movie fell asleep twice surprised they cast such a boring actress she was the boat anchor for the movie
Apr 3 2019,negative,although the film does attempt to introduce a new character into the already established mcu the film can boast a well thought antagonist in talos the skrull commander who in turn has a better story arc than that of the protagonist thus the film does suffer from a  narrative consisting of too many one off jokes one upsetting in particular and a series of rushed events that only exist to set up endgame as a standalone maybe not so well but as an introduction itll stay at painfully average
Apr 3 2019,negative,i didnt care for the movie strong female lead with predictable and weak scenes complete waste of money
Apr 3 2019,negative,i went in to this movie wanting to love it as much as i love the captain marvel character but i was sorely disappointed  brie larson has zero charisma in this film and was clearly miscast i was looking for a moment where everything turned around but that moment never came  there appeared to be no chemistry between the actors at all either  i have to admit that i really expected marvels answer to wonder woman to be at least as exciting but it didnt even come close  to put it another way the theatre was almost empty and the 3 people who were seating in the row in front of me left the theatre at just past the halfway point  such a disappointment 
Apr 3 2019,negative,horrible movie through and through story line was trash the only enjoyment i received was from the brief cameos by some of the villains in guardians of the galaxy it was cool seeing ronin the accuser again other than that this movie could be tossed into the trash with the dc fails first marvel movie i havenï 12tmt enjoyed
Apr 3 2019,positive,like it but not loved it
Apr 3 2019,positive,the movie was amazing i honestly donï 12 12 12 12tmt understand how some people said it was to slow it was perfect
Apr 3 2019,positive,not the best one but its good enough to get a good review
Apr 3 2019,negative,i wanted to love this movie the first heroine with a feature film in the mcu about halfway in i was so disappointed in this film it was unoriginal and i boring the best part of this movie was the cat i wasnt happy about how fury was portrayed either the whole movie was just trying too hard to make me like it this was an obvious stepping stone to the main eventendgame i will not be seeing this again disaster
Apr 3 2019,positive,not great and not terrible like many iï 12tmm sure i slightly bought into what iï 12tmd heard on the net mostly wrong it was a good movie my daughters and wife enjoyed it as did i itï 12tms definitely not one of the best marvel movies thatï 12tms been made by any stretch if youï 12tmre a comic book fan this movie will be okay
Apr 3 2019,positive,saw three times in theaters  had a blast every time  good movie
Apr 3 2019,positive,i loved this i loved how carol felt like a real person instead of someone with money and influence and access to amazing training and power she was funny in her own right instead of just playing off everyone else and situational gags
Apr 3 2019,negative,what what the hell was that marvel
Apr 3 2019,positive,marvel knocked it out of the park again well done these bad reviews are totally undeserving if you love the mcu you will love captain marvel
Apr 3 2019,neutral,pros special effects sam jackson kinda funny  cons everything else
Apr 3 2019,negative,i was an old employee of blockbuster and the nostalgia was all too real also the scar scene was dumb no more politics in superhero movies
Apr 3 2019,positive,honestly i watch this movie with an open mind and it was not as woke or  feminist as all the negative hype made it seem   brie larson character was likable but her acting was a bit stiff there were also a lot of mary sue elements   these problems aside the movie was decent the plot twist was interesting at least i didnt see it coming given what i knewexpectations of the villains   this was a average marvel movie better than thor the dark world at least
Apr 3 2019,positive,captain marvel comes in as a filler movie for the mcu and was mediocre at best but still a ton of fun 
Apr 3 2019,positive,another stellar entry into the mcu is it perfect no is it entertaining and fun yes am i totally jazzed to see captain marvel in end game you know it
Apr 3 2019,negative,the movie has serious feminist overtones major chnages to the source material alter significant context of character development would not recommend
Apr 3 2019,positive,another perfect marvel movie that leads us to the end game
Apr 3 2019,positive,i do not understand the hate that capt marvel has gotten from some folks    iâtmm a huge fan of comics and a huge fan of the mcu while i donâtmt think this film is as good as black panther itâtms wonderful in its own right    captain marvel has âgirl powerâ and thatâtms emphasized throughout the film and it doesnâtmt shy away from it furyâtms dominating persona as portrayed by jackson is subdued by the influence of capt marvel as it should be if this version of capt marvel offends the proud boysget over it
Apr 3 2019,negative,an underwhelming overhyped disaster brie larson is by far the least likeable actress in the mcu this is nothing but agenda pushing propaganda to keep telling women that arenâtmt worthy sam jackson had to be cast in this film as a main in order for audiences to show up heâtms the most enjoyable part
Apr 3 2019,positive,average origin bolstered by an impressive legacy hopeful of a better tomorrow
Apr 3 2019,negative,saw at odeon its nothing special and whilst it has its moments of this is getting good it never lasted
Apr 3 2019,neutral,the movie was fine i suppose  great graphics  just replace brie larson  she is not right for this part  i love her acting in other movies  performance was not to the level needed for the role  i hope her role in end game is minimal  samuel jackson is always a win
Apr 3 2019,positive,marvel never fails to put on a good show
Apr 3 2019,negative,this is generously a stage 1 mcu origin story at best  there is no heros journey in the story no real moments of weakness in carol danvers no real moments of remorse or regret in her actions  theres no chemistry between her and the supporting cast or with really anyone for that matter  finally furys lost eye really  thats the best you could come up with  finally the entire movie lacks the comical twists that the mcu has adopted for all of their recent movies
Apr 3 2019,positive,was cool i guess but not for me 
Apr 3 2019,neutral,it was okay they tried to make it seem like she was overcoming hardships and flaws but just turns out those were her strengths all alongdo the opposite of what youre told to do also the character was way to quick to be super chummy with all the new earthlings she ran into with all the friend banter within 10 seconds of meeting someone it was a bad movie but it wasnt marvels best foot forward either
Apr 3 2019,negative,meh slow and dull with an eyerollingly obvious agenda has contempt for the source material and for those to whom that is important brie larson is charismafree and her voice grates the directors seem to think she can be as funny as iron man as resolute as cap as noble as thor and as tough as the hulk she is none of those ixve been reading comics with carol danvers for 40 years this is not her
Apr 3 2019,positive,just an ok movie not a strong enough villain it seems like they were just trying to find a way to add captain marvel into the lineup
Apr 3 2019,neutral,struggled not to fall asleep in the middle  it was ok not great  on a par with antman imo
Apr 3 2019,neutral,you know captain marvel its not bad movie for schoolgirls and boys but heve got 2 big minuses  1 he is so boring 2 so predictable i knew how cm will be finished from the start of film
Apr 3 2019,positive,captain marvel wasnt a bad movie it was and experiment in missed opportunityhistoric bad guys the skrulls turned into oppressed good guys no that was a turn off it would have been better if they had been working for thanos looking for the infinity stones or something like that marvel tried too hard to tie everything avenger to her where the subtle nature of interconnectivity is what made the others work so well
Apr 3 2019,negative,generic bland 1 dimensional characters
Apr 3 2019,positive,i loved it it was a wonderful marvel origin story on par with captain america and other debut movies the representation was nice to see but didnt feel forced or made the main focus of the movie seen alot of people saying they didnt like this movie for really irrelevant reasons not sure why
Apr 3 2019,negative,i went into this with high hopes and was disappointed it looked like a b move with a large budget there was no real character conflict and the bad guys were more interesting than the antagonists i really hope this isnt the style marvel keeps through the others as this was hard to watch and harder to justify spending that much money on
Apr 3 2019,negative,i couldnt relate to the main character and didnt feel like it was a superhero movie
Apr 3 2019,positive,it was a fun movie meant to introduce a new character to the mcu it is weighed down by being an origin story but the buddy cop chemistry between carol and nick was great its middle of the pack as the mcu goes but its fun and you should watch it if you like marvel or superheroes
Apr 3 2019,positive,captain marvel is neither underrated nor overrated as a 78 criticâtms score unlike some other recent marvel moviescough black panther overrated cough infinity war underrated cough it is a fun movie that is enjoyable for casual movie watchers and if that is you this movie should have no problems but as a movie critic andor a marvel fan this movie is pretty average across the board captain marvel is just solid right in the middle of likeable heroes the story is solid with some good twists but ultimately a little forgettable on the mcu scale and a solid cast of characters with some standouts like nick fury and some randoms like captain marvelâtms earth friend or jude law overall should be just fine for me this one is in the middle of the pack as far as origin stories go hope she continues to grow in the future
Apr 3 2019,negative,it has its grand moments of action and effects but when led by a miscast brie larson the main character is robbed of any fun or humor that isnâtmt of the snarky kind
Apr 3 2019,positive,amazing film thanks 
Apr 3 2019,positive,great origin in the mighty marvel tradition phase 1 style only issue is furys eye injury origin that kept it from being perfect more coulson hopefully in an extended cut cant wait for the sequel
Apr 3 2019,neutral,it felt like a marvel phase 1 movie that created loopholes rather than uniting the mcu
Apr 3 2019,positive,story had a nice pace and told a non linear order of events which kept revealing new information as journalist might say peeling the onion  brie larson is extremely charismatic and delivers the full range of emotions and humour impeccably    lets get obvious comparisons with wonder woman out of the way then  this film was much brighter and optimistic and did not define the female lead by a male love interest wonder woman even gave the most heroic moment to the male lead and used this as her main motivation  the action sequences played at a better pace and real interaction with rather than large epic slowmo set pieces
Apr 3 2019,negative,messes w the established mcu timeline too much brings up logic questions for a1a3 what fury says about his lost eye in a1  preachy predictable who didnt see that surprise twist coming lame dialogue and storytelling  this character  who basically has all power  isnt interesting or strong enough for a standalone movie  im sure ill like cm more in endgame when shes just a bit player
Apr 3 2019,negative,ugly no story line and has  no good relation
Apr 3 2019,negative,bland boring banal brie  i feel like brie larson doesnt have the comedic timing to make the film funny if they chose another female lead to play captain marvel maybe the film world be funnier  ps im a female who isnt white im not antifeminism i still did not like the film
Apr 3 2019,negative,jackson performed as usual with great passion and is this movies saving grace but unfortunately the story suffered from the director treating this movie as a cram as much stuff to prep for thanos as possible and use a military outfit for marvel harkening to the batman remakes if you dont care about comics and just want something to kill your time give it a view but definitely wait for streaming services a waste of ticket price
Apr 3 2019,negative,worst marvel movie to date
Apr 3 2019,positive,it was very entertaining and that was it after infinity war i was waiting for a more complex movie but this one seems a lot like the very first mcu movies even thought it was fun and loved all the 90s references hope they will make more interesting this character in the upcoming films
Apr 3 2019,negative,there is no heros journey
Apr 3 2019,negative,meh and boring does nothing all movie the cat is the only true hero
Apr 3 2019,positive,some cringe but overall its a good movi
Apr 3 2019,negative,it was underwhelming at best if it wasnt for samuel l jackson and jude law itd be the worst mcu movie made
Apr 3 2019,negative,was your basic marvel movie a filler to add a character into a later movie it had its funny moments i think it would have been more enjoyable if it was cast differently brie larsons acting was terrible and took away from the movie story was ok on par with iron man 2
Apr 3 2019,negative,one of the worst movies to come out of the comic machine in a long time
Apr 3 2019,negative,very disappointed very cookie cutter and main character is so milk toast it sad i dont think this movie adds anything to the marvel story as a whole
Apr 3 2019,negative,the movie sucked 2 stars for jude law and ben mendelsohn
Apr 3 2019,positive,this one has come a little too late but was totally worth the wait one of the best marvel movies so far and brie larson does an epic job as captain marvel
Apr 2 2019,positive,actually a pretty good movie no i dont work for disney i actually liked the performance brie larson some had said she was playing the female version of tony stark but i didnt see that at all she isnt overly funny she is much more reserved i kind of liked that because so many marvel characters are overly witty and do that wink wink look at me im just pretending to be a super hero
Apr 2 2019,positive,very good didnt follow a normal basic storyline was on the edge of my seat the whole time
Apr 2 2019,positive,captain marvel is a amazing movie
Apr 2 2019,negative,the movie was boring
Apr 2 2019,positive,inspirational feels funny empowering wishitwaslonger
Apr 2 2019,negative,the first marvel movie that fails in present a hero or make me care about her
Apr 2 2019,positive,i thought all the complaints about this movie having this or that agenda are unfounded my wife and i enjoyed this movie a lot and found that the characters plot writing etc were very well done sure there was a lot of women can kick ass too feel but in a way that felt natural to me not forced as some other people thought it was definitely go see this one
Apr 2 2019,neutral,the shell of a marvel film  and thats about it    first id like to start off by saying that i think hollywood really takes for granted how trusted of a brand marvel studios is especially after having to suffer all those years through a plethora of abhorrentdisappointing blockbuster films ie transformers dc comics star wars etc nothing against black panther but how many exceptional marvel films do you honestly have to overlook in that context before you finally give in and say you know  these films might be major blockbusters but theyre successful for several reasons    having said all this  captain marvel is a legitimate let down    is it the worst film ever no    although brie larson offered some pretty smug divisive comments leading into the film  personally that should neither break nor make the film    for starters brie larsons performance seemed nonexistent very much like carol danverss backstory there was very little to latch onto which makes me wonder if there was a better way to interpret her forgettable past her personality even came off as cringeworthy a few times making her unbearable    samuel l jacksons performance was great as the fresh nick fury the cgi team did a great job of making him look younger although no cgi could help him get through those stunt scenes while his face might have looked young jacksons old age was pretty apparent in his physical performances i still think his best action scene was his driving sequence in captain america winter soldier and nothing comes close to that in this film    and while im talking about jackson goose scratching out furys eye was ridiculous it kills the mystery behind his eye patch  and i am now forever anticipating stupid runon jokes about how some cat scratched it out by the time we see him in winter soldier its understood that the man has been through hell losing an eye to a cat is not necessarily what i had in mind i know the cat was actually a pretty horrific alien  but he was scratched while trying to get cuddly in it    ben mendelsohns performance was also noteworthy and i really like the ambiguity surrounding the skrulls storyline that was one of the few redeeming moments of the film and im looking forward to them in future marvel films    goose seemed pretty unnecessary comedic sure but gooses motivations seemed questionable when moving about in the movie specifically why was goose following danvers and fury around  even onto the prototype quinjet and why was goose on earth to begin with at any rate  goose seemed to be forced into the movie for one major purpose to get fury etc out of a pinch the lead up to that was a bit of a mess and  again  the cat scratch was underwhelming    at the end of the day captain marvel seemed very unnecessary i wasnt crazy about larsons performance and i wasnt crazy about carol danvers either especially since they shortchanged her personal story so much personally i think a better rewrite of this film would have been if they went in chronological order with the crash taking place in the first 20 minutes you couldve inserted plenty of feminine themes leading up to that moment giving the audience time to absorb it and identify with her    i recommend waiting for it on bluray theres nothing compelling about this film that requires you to see if before endgame
Apr 2 2019,positive,pretty generic but i guess it gets the job done
Apr 2 2019,positive,after all the drama and the back and forth with the gender politics i finally watched it it was not bad not great just a not at all unwatchable movie it had its moments but fell short of having the same magic as past movies that the mcu had produced better than antman worse that civil waror should i look at it as a palate cleanser preparing for endgamesomething to gurgle and rinse the mouth out all i have to say is she better step up her game if captain marvel thinks shes going to take up the mcu helm for the next generation
Apr 2 2019,negative,not really my cup of teawallace
Apr 2 2019,negative,i feel its more or less a cop out as in they have these amazing female superhero like scarlet witch and black widow both amazing characters with scarlet witch set to be one of the most powerful beings on every to live and they go and undercut all this with captain marvel i was fairly bored through out the movie and found myself picking at my finger nails more often then watching the movie not necessary to see before end game i would only only recommend this movie if some one rents it and you have nothing better to do for the next to hours
Apr 2 2019,negative,supremely bland great cat performance
Apr 2 2019,negative,the movie left me very confused regarding captain marvels abilities  in every action scene it felt like captain marvel was given every power without any connection of how she is able to produce her capabilities  its not a terrible movie but not a good movie  id say its a oneanddone kinda movie  my kiddos fell asleep twice during the movie  oh well the cat was pretty awesome though
Apr 2 2019,negative,garbage of all the marvel films this is the worst
Apr 2 2019,positive,after watching this particular film i have decided that i dont see a point to see the conflict because from the beginning she was basically superman with no cripanite
Apr 2 2019,negative,being a marvel movie is very disappointing so much hype and it was a big let down brie larson was very flat as captain marvel the visuals look fine especially samuel jackson he looked very young and the rest was fine mediocre villain mediocre hero probably the biggest disappointment in 2019
Apr 2 2019,positive,a little slow to get going but a nice expansion of the mcu
Apr 2 2019,negative,sucha a poorly directed acted and written movie i literally could not watch it because it was to dark the character development was bland as well dont waste money on it
Apr 2 2019,negative,its a downgrade for the mcu  marvel now in high level in the quality and this one is a big disappointment 
Apr 2 2019,negative,boring  no character development no interesting villains chaotic fight scenes  good deaging visuals
Apr 2 2019,negative,this movie has alot of very awkward moments the musical score did not compliment any of the scenes in the movie and felt very flat i believe the acting was fine but the directing screen play plot and writing were just terrible a low point for mcu
Apr 2 2019,neutral,a mixed bag and a solid c rating casual audiences will generally receive it favorably big fans of the mcu will be disappointed to downright offended fury coulson the interchanges before the main avengers story arcs were overall pleasing despite creating some sizable plot holes the stan lee tribute was touching ms larsons acting fell short seeming much more cardboard and stale than henry cavills as superman at times overall her character doesnt come off nowhere near as strong as scarjos black widow or elizabeth olsens scarlet witch who by comparison are not as powerful characters but unfortunately they failed where black panther succeeded they wanted to do an empowering movie for women and girls but this movie has so many subtle not so subtle and frankly unnecessary divisive moments to downplay or demonize every face of white men with the exception of coulson that is divides the audience marvel missed their formula in the mcu for the really the first time for me short of iron man 3 it is disappointing and i hope they take a lesson from making sure they stay on task with understanding you cant be inclusive if youre being divisive nailed it in black panther nailed it other strong female characters in the mcu but ultimately they failed in the delivery their main hero and strongest avenger was supposed to deliver it can be redeemed but the character is gonna need some rework going forward 
Apr 2 2019,negative,did not do anything right
Apr 2 2019,negative,least favorite marvel movie leading actor had no charisma for the role
Apr 2 2019,negative,i feel like i have seen this movie 100 times already it other words very boring
Apr 2 2019,positive,one of the forgettable ones unfortunately this one falls on the lower end of the marvel movies suffers from the marvel formula especially with being an origin movie
Apr 2 2019,positive,i needed this film as a child
Apr 2 2019,negative,its fine as it best but still dissapointing in a lot of ways
Apr 2 2019,negative,i saw the movieyesterday and i was soooo soo lost in everything that was going on o was actually  about mid way was looking for the movie to finally end nothing about this movie actually made sense
Apr 2 2019,negative,does not do the character justice i like carol danvers but this version is disappointing
Apr 2 2019,positive,i have to say it just didnt feel like an mcu movie a little slow at times carol a was a little too standoffish no personality poorly written i think the actress did what she could with what she had
Apr 2 2019,positive,what a great movie with a great soundtrack
Apr 2 2019,positive, its not the best mcu film but its not a bad movie either im pretty sure if btw wasnt spouting her sjw non sense before the movie came out the ratings would be much higher 
Apr 2 2019,negative,just like every marvel movie its well thoughout and well written and almost all the actors are spot on the only problem i really had was the lead actress brie larson kinda ruined it for me i think they should have chosen a better more suited actress amd im hoping she doesnt ruin endgame for me like she did this movie i had really high hopes for this but it just wasmt there
Apr 2 2019,positive,loved it have to look past obvious weirdness like her makeup always looking good and her hair curled after being in space but still fun
Apr 2 2019,positive,absolutely fantastic movie one of the best marvel adaptions yet
Apr 2 2019,negative,this film was rotten in every way
Apr 2 2019,negative,slow to develop extremely predictable and the only ï 12 12avenger ï 12 12 movie i will not see multiple times much akin to star wars franchise i can understand why they saved this film until after showing much better films
Apr 2 2019,positive,i saw captain marvel twice in the cinema and i think it is a really well made superhero movie with a great message and role model for young women in captain marvel herself ive followed anna boden and ryan fleck for a little while with half nelson being one of my all time favourite films so i found the directing very fluid and fast paced whilst keeping their independent roots through less flashy parts of the film i thought the scrip was well written with very nice hints towards the inequality women have faced for years this is one of the best marvel films up there with infinity war and black panthar
Apr 2 2019,positive,solid marvel outing refreshing to have another tony stark  peter quill type lead who is witty and a little cocky but can get away with it worth seeing at least once
Apr 2 2019,positive,i loved it for combining my two loves comic books and fighter jets it fits nicely in the avengers universe and i thought brie larson was a great carol danvers 
Apr 2 2019,negative,started out strong and then meh
Apr 2 2019,positive,great movie awesome music choices furygoose awesome
Apr 2 2019,positive,definitely being one of this universes weaker entry this film still delivers on a fun film with an interesting character and premise even when riddled with plot and character issues
Apr 2 2019,negative,similar to antman some fun action scenes but overall a very forgettable movie its creators seemingly forgot that even though a movie can be political it still needs to be entertaining
Apr 2 2019,negative,aside from maybe one moment in the film captain marvel fails to give us anything new or different to an overworked cinematic universe while not the first failure of the series captain marvel reminds me of every reoccurring problem i have with these films the problem with being the twentyfirst film in the franchise is that nothing seems all that interesting anymore
Apr 2 2019,neutral,easily one of the lower tier mcu movies something felt off about larsons performance it was very dry compared to what weve come to expect from an mcu movie the story felt rushed and the characters underdeveloped also could have done without the heavy handed girl power scenes crammed into the mix c
Apr 2 2019,negative,very average and predictable story did nothing new and i could of honestly not seen it and i wouldnt of missed out of anything for example i havent  seen black panther and even after infinity war i still feel no need to see it
Apr 2 2019,neutral,great pace and action but plot and character development leave a lot to be desired
Apr 2 2019,negative,it was really cheesy with a   nerf ad right in the middle
Apr 2 2019,negative,wife and i watched it and she was the first to say it was fairly boring and mediocre compared to other movies in this franchise also that brie larsons cocky attitude and acting was off putting at times but at least it had a few action scenes and some jokes that gave us a giggle
Apr 2 2019,positive,overall a solid movie that struggles with a few hard sells we know the apparent heroes at the start will turn out to be the villians so getting the audience invested in them to make it feel like a betrayal is an uphill battle that the film neither quite fully succeeds in     that said the production team seem to realise this very early on and abandon the effort to focus on carol rediscovering herself it does leave the final confrontation feeling a little hollow but then they subvert it and the opening part about looking to others for validation but cutting it short with the message that we define ourselves and we dont need others to do that for us ive seen a lot of criticism of the film for being preachy but that was honestly the most on the nose it got and im fine with that its a solid message to send    minor nitpicks are things like an atmospheric aircraft being transformed into a space craft i can buy the engine upgrade but structurally its still an atmospheric craft not built for the rigours of atmospheric reentry but this isnt the first time we have seen such silliness from the mcu so i cant hold it against the film any more than i do the others the entirely predictable the baddies are actually the goodies and vice versa thing is a long running trope but again thats a larger issue within film storytelling in general and isnt exclusive to captain marvel but it does hamper the film ever so slightly    those minor criticisms aside its a solid film well made with an interesting story compelling characters and overall a great addition to the mcu and certainly superior to the underwhelming captain america civil war and avengers infinity war
Apr 2 2019,neutral,justa notheer summer bluckbuster that plays safe it feels like just more of the same i ive it a 34 because it just plays so safe that you do not dislike it but finis the money and like ok should we go eat sushi no and forget about it is nothing wow or new more of the same
Apr 1 2019,neutral,a decent origin story however not exactly ground breaking in anyway brie larson provides a believable and compelling character who is easily relatable and entertaining however the story itself feels largely similiar to many of its predecessors this perhaps could have been avoided by leaning more heavily into its 90s setting the throwbacks were the strongest and most memorable parts of the film i would have enjoyed more
Apr 1 2019,positive,this was ok not great sam jackson always kills as fury but the back story built up to a pretty disappointing conclusion i suppose the avengers have set the bar almost too high for individual movies to capture the same level of excitement
Apr 1 2019,positive,an epic origin story to captain marvel that is visually mesmerizing but emotionally lacklustre in the end just becoming an average edition to the superhero genre
Apr 1 2019,negative,it did a good job ecplaining how shield  came to being and why colson and frucy have mutual respect other than that the plot coud have  been from any action film that the main star has been lied to and then takes revengedoes an ok jo tryin gto piece things but definitlely not wonder womanit was more about plugging holes in the mcu than it was about captain marvel plus it could do without the misygonistic scenes i know it was in the 70s but there is so much more to explore about that time period  left me with more questions than answers  who was the ai  how come its so powerfulwhy did they pump blue blood into her 
Apr 1 2019,negative,tribute to stan lee and the end credits were the best part of this
Apr 1 2019,negative,too much back story not enough dramaaction 
Apr 1 2019,neutral,it was unexciting i liked larsons performance and the buddy cop aspect but the script set design casting were all underwhelming and bland
Apr 1 2019,negative,worst mcu movie yet really dissapointed hope cm is not central to plot of endgame
Apr 1 2019,positive,love this movie go see it
Apr 1 2019,negative,false cliche and poorly written
Apr 1 2019,negative,meh mildly entertaining but falls far short of others in the marvel universe  feels like this was phoned in  the lead character is not endearing in the slightest  didnt buy it  nor should i have bought it the ticket that is
Apr 1 2019,positive,long winded and dialogue heavy in some parts but this origin story is as fresh as any other marvel blockbuster
Apr 1 2019,positive,i really wasnt sure about this movie going into it  i had no background knowledge of this character and wasnt really eager about her story mostly because of that ridiculous name captain marvel cmon  but now that ive seen the movie and understand the character i like her a lot more and am even keen to see how the character progresses in the next avengers installment she is tough as nails and is pretty badass even before she gets her powers  the mcu sort of has a schism between the spaceworld and the earthworld and the stories about the heroes from each have their own vibe to them this one splits the difference bringing a space story literally down to earth  stylistically and tonally it rides the coattails of the guardians of the galaxy films rather than any of the avengers stories the film sports a rad 90s soundtrack in the same way that guardians was loaded with classic 70s songs and it tries to infuse the same kind of humor into the story but mostly fails the humor feels forced and generally falls pretty flat  storywise it mostly follows the standard originstory formula and doesnt boil down to anything new  but as they say the devil is in the details and this is where it succeeds there is no love interest subplot the story is all about carol danvers as an individual and how she comes into her own as a superhero  not that lovestories were ever a big feature in marvel films with the possible exception of the thor movies but it is nonexistent here  carol is never once sexualized and the fact that shes a woman is never discussed its not even a factor  finally girls and women everywhere will have a halloween costume that keeps them warm  i can see why she is a feminist icon its a real rarity when a female character is given a story that does not involve her femininity andor sexuality in any way  the story is wellwritten and delivers some good twists and turns all while somehow maintaining continuity with the storylines from the 20 movies that came before it  the dialogue is sometimes clunky and not everything makes sense all the time i still dont understand why she never gets injured  is she wolverine in addition to an energyinfused human power bomb but the plot and the character motivations are convincing and that goes a long way  its also fun to see the characters you know and love from shield as their younger selves fury when he still had his eye coulson when he still had his hair oh and the lovely tribute to stan lee in the opening credits could not have been more perfect it brought a tear to my eye and his cameo in this one is probably my favorite  overall i definitely had a good time but im not marveling at this one  as ive said before after 21 movies the novelty is wearing thin and with each film i get a little less enthusiastic still this is a worthy addition to the franchise even if the only real barrier it breaks is the glass ceiling
Apr 1 2019,negative,mediocre script mediocre lead this movie tries to capitalize on the women are wonderful movement and on the 90s nostalgia but that obviously got it nowhere especially with brie larson sucking up all the fun out of the movie with her expressionless face  i hereby dub this the worst marvel movie of all time
Apr 1 2019,positive,brie larson is remarkable in her role as captain marvel the movie lacks confidence and although action thrilling the move is alright
Apr 1 2019,negative,very slow the action scenes were pretty good but didnt feel any threat or need to even care if the baddies won or not im a big comic book fan and did not like how they changed marvel to some lady and also changed the skrulls i felt no connection to carol danvers from the film if i didnt know her story i wouldnt give a damn what about her i pleed with movie makers stop changing source material 99 of the comics you are  basing your movies on have it down perfect
Apr 1 2019,positive,brie larson is a great captain marvel the story was good whenever you could make sense of it but it would have been awesome if the writers had done a more sequential story line than the multiple flashbacks guardians of the galaxy lost nothing with minimal flashbacks in fact it was far better than captain marvel because the story was fun and easy to follow unless confusion was what the writers were going for i recommend tell a better story 
Apr 1 2019,positive,one of marvels best films  brie larson knocked it out of the park
Apr 1 2019,negative,a dud on the level of thor 2
Apr 1 2019,negative,utterly boring only the loud soundtrack is preventing to have a nap after 30 minutes into it
Apr 1 2019,neutral,if youre going to this movie to see a marvel movie then youre getting what you paid for if youre going to see anything different than that youll be disappointed they tried to tell the origin story in a different way and it was interesting how they did that but they reveal nothing about her through the flashbacks brie larson is a good actor but she doesnt feel like captain marvel at all i blame that on the script though just like all mcu films it takes liberties with the material so expect that but i think they did well enought with what they did most people who dont even want to see this movie will go see it just so theyre up to speed on whats happening in the mcu so thats what id say about it its not a great standalone movie but it does add lore to the larger mcu
Apr 1 2019,negative,she is way over power i feel that she is going to destroy end game
Apr 1 2019,negative,bleh after all the hype and other mcu flicks youd have thought this might be good but alas  yawn
Apr 1 2019,positive,normally i like marvel better than dc but wonder woman really set a standard for female superhero movies that this film simply did not meet
Apr 1 2019,positive,great fun wonderful story would have liked to see a bit more depth in the character from brie larson but she was still good and i have a feeling she gave what the director asked for
Apr 1 2019,neutral,it was a fine popcorn film in the vein of the 90s
Apr 1 2019,positive,great movie loved brie larson in it
Apr 1 2019,positive,captain marvel was typical trash i predicted everything that was to happen and there was no wow factor its you basic super hero finds there power and figures out who they are in time to defeat the enemy who was never seen to be the enemy in the first place complete and utter crap
Apr 1 2019,positive,loved it  criticism is bs  in the movie its nothing my marvel magic and a pretty good plot
Apr 1 2019,positive,i enjoyed this move im a huge mcu fan and ive always liked bri larsen and sam jackson i thought the aliens were done very well the cat is hilarious all that said it did feel thrown together a bit as a must make origin story before end game i would put it in the middle of the pack of mcu movies and there has never been an mcu movie i didnt care for other than thor 2 or ironman 2 all the haters on here for her are simply that haters this was a solid flick and a good addition to the mcu
Apr 1 2019,negative,i went into this with pretty middle of the road expectations based on the trailers alone  in that regard it was a pretty mediocre marvel film reminiscent of the first thor movie  there is really no main villain more of a group of people an obvious twist a lack of emotional impact lack of danger which all led to just a lack of vested interest in the movie  the main villain if you could really call him that hes kinda only a slight villain at the end poses no threat to captain marvel at the end and there is no real epic battle that puts carol danvers in a position where you feel she could lose the final battles are just her beating the heck out of everyone and learning new powers instantly with no real challenge  it was not terrible like some people say but again is a pretty bland and forgettable adventure like the first thor movie or even the second one  brie larson also never felt like she was having fun with the role and in the few scenes she started to have fun they just ended up right back to being dull and drab to be fair captain marvel in the comics has been a stick in the mud lately as well so it maybe being to faithful to the comics in that regard    overall it was boring and totally expected  i wish they had done more to make this movie a lot of fun and give captain marvel a chance
Apr 1 2019,positive,great movie kids loved it cant wait to see the next one
Apr 1 2019,negative,after infinity war when i saw the post credit scene i was really excited for this i really wanted this to be good it just didnt really live up to the hype  it didnt seem to be an adventure that takes the audience to the edge of their seats no challenge or struggle yon and his crew didnt pose a threat ronan the accuser nothing the skrulls are just grunts that get beat up and with a weird twist  the story is just about being suppressed i mean shes great at everything and the only problem is that yon and the kree are just suppressing her awesomeness then when she came to that realization suddenly no one can stop her there wasnt even an inner struggle like with the hulk or dark phoenix where they themselves are trying to control and suppress the power they have and furys eye really whew man it was quite a let down and whats with the military training flashback with the no place for little girls line or something like that the setting was in the 90s right please marvel and disney dont let end game be like the last jedi
Apr 1 2019,positive,i enjoyed it confused as to why its called captain marvel tho as that is not her name
Apr 1 2019,positive,captain marvel is a great mcu movie with a well developed plot and characters i think the fact that it is a movie set in the 90s and that it is the first ever mcu movie with a female lead captain marvel is a great movie for younger girls to relate to i always wanted a cool female badass superhero movie character when i was younger not only that but they adress a few of the problems women face  however quite a lot of people disagree with my opinion as most think that what makes a great female superhero is her sexualising costume
Apr 1 2019,positive,probably the best marvel movie up until now great script and direction fabulous cast first class entertainment all my friends loved this movie so much and my brother just literally forced me to by tickets to watch it again tomorrow dont miss captain marvel in cinemas its so much fun with a great story
Apr 1 2019,negative,boring movie watch it and want my money back but guess thatâtms my fault
Apr 1 2019,positive,i watched it yesterday and really enjoyed it
Apr 1 2019,positive,absolutely great movie the best from mcu so far high quality superhero movie
Apr 1 2019,negative,i was very disappointed in the character captain marvel i really hope that they built her up because im not looking forward to seeing her for another seven moives
Apr 1 2019,positive,besides the mixed reviews i like it  although brie larson or whatever her name is  reminds me of kristen stewart with her lack of emotional range  the story line was really good tho but it was no surprise who the villain ends up being  i didnt think i would end up liking the movie  but it was pretty good
Apr 1 2019,neutral,not up to the usual high standard of marvel movies jokes between characters werent very funny tried hard to be pc which was annoying even removed any sex appeal that the main character had  sheesh wonder woman demonstrated that you dont need to do that to have a strong woman character
Apr 1 2019,positive,this was a very entertaining movie the action was good the movie was very funny at times the had a very good story 
Apr 1 2019,negative,the first hour was boring the build up to the climax was unrealistic and lacked drama and the big payoff was a dust yourself off and try again flashback 
Apr 1 2019,negative,contrary to the description provided above there is little comedy in the movie a few gags here or there but little to make you do much more than smirk or giggle not unlike our protagonist a superhero origin movie that leaves one wanting for more charisma from the titular character and breezes over any substative motivation carol danvers might have in exchange for nods towards political statements couple that with several continuity errors from what was already established in the mcu and youre left with a movie that has excellent effects a nostalgic soundtrack and baffling storyline choices
Apr 1 2019,negative,one of the weakest from the marvel movies
Apr 1 2019,negative,i donï 12 12tmt think this movie was good at all terrible acting it was really fake
Apr 1 2019,negative,captain marvel was incredibly medicore this is so below a marvel movie its like the writers put absolutely no effort into this riding on the coattails of avengersendgame hype and laughing all the way to the bank i seen an advertisement for captain marvel on a pineapple they were really pushing this movie hard and now i see why it just wasnt good it was also the only thing worthwhile playing in theatres making me feel even more duped all of the good movies coming out weeks from the day i saw captain marvel
Apr 1 2019,negative,the problem with the movie is that there is no emotional connection to the character and captain marvel didnt ever change or get better she just let her emotions control what she did even when she was sparing and getting angry that she was losing
Apr 1 2019,positive,ive now seen this times 3 and it gets better every time brie totally brought something very much her own to the role excited to see her work in endgame and the sequel to this awesome movie haters gonna hate but captain marvel has nostalgic music themes humor action arcs and heart felt moments with something for everyone to take home at the root of it all it reflects present day culture war from a scifi point of view and instills the value of being better and being on the right side of things higher further faster baby
Apr 1 2019,negative,boring bad overhyped bad acting childish kinda good visually speaking but then again were not paying to stare at pictures
Apr 1 2019,neutral,while not bad it wasnt good either  i never felt connected to herthat i was rooting for her to win  i also never fully understood what her powers are and more importantly her weaknesses  in one moment she having trouble fighting a few guys hand to hand the nextshe takes out a big spaceship with ease  worth my  to watch once but that was it
Apr 1 2019,negative,i would give this a 0 if i could my mom and i were semi excited to see this movie only because of the avengers infinity war captain marvel symbol appearing at the end and i was disappointed i loved brie larson in scott pilgrim v the world and in kong skull island but her acting was not that good carol was a very stuck up character the plot line didnâtmt  add up to the avengers plot line the skrull war was not that great the action scenes were i rather not get into that i found goose nick and maria as well as monic great carol was just a very unlikable character and some sequences in the movie mad no sense this would have been done better if by a different director and if monica rambeau was the main mcaptain marvel
Apr 1 2019,positive,i like it plan and simple but didnt woow me it is trying to hard to be funny with lame jokes i believe that captain marvel carachter has less charisma than a plate of grits in a southern breakfast with out maple cyrup
Apr 1 2019,positive,great movie snuck in some cool social issues action funny nostalgic and smart
Apr 1 2019,negative,just want any good larson was miscast in this role no story arc like other mcu characters 
Apr 1 2019,negative,on the bottom of my mcu list along with thor dark world it was bland no heros journey she was powerful with an attitude at the beginning and ends with her being powerful with an attitude her character never grows and she is just all strong just a weak story worst mcu origin story in my opinion i really hope her role in endgame is minimal
Apr 1 2019,negative,really boring movie almost slept through the movie little or no character depth the film doesnt really make us care about the lead character because the film fails to add any depth to the character and it feels like the character is being kept in check in fact every other characters had more depth than the lead  also the lead character has little or no expressions and appears stonelike and is really irritating at times carol denvers doesnt really do anything to amaze or inspire us or make us fall in love with the character  humor from the lead character seems forced and unnatural because she seems bored most of the time carol denvers is not a really funny character samuel l jackson ben mendelsohn and jude law were the best parts of the film since the lead character didnt have much to do and they do try in every way to save the movie  the whole movie seems to be based on convenient plot twists if something happens it is because the plot demands it so  from technical standpoint bad lighting bad color palette choices especially during the train fight scene mediocre cgi and fight scenes really leaves much to be desired  in a nutshell the movie has nothing really new to offer and really just seems like a passtime and a lazy attempt to introduce the captain marvel character while we wait for avengers endgame
Apr 1 2019,negative,i think i subconsciously wanted it to be similar to wonder woman which i thought was fantastic but captain marvels character was not very easy to like or get attached to it was very disappointing i didnt hate the movie but it could have been so much better
Apr 1 2019,positive,better than i expected based on many of the reviews larson was ok 
Apr 1 2019,negative,worst marvel movie everboring predictable and not funny at all
Apr 1 2019,negative,yet another paint by numbers marvel movie not the worst of the bunch but thoroughly oldhat youve seen it before
Apr 1 2019,negative,something i would see once the character was very one dimensional and the story was predictable mcu could do without this one
Apr 1 2019,negative,not what i expected couldnt relate much to the main character and her story
Apr 1 2019,negative,the only reason i love marvel movies is because of the storytelling and narrative they choose every main character in the mcu teaches something even though they have powers they have their weak spots captain marvel in another hand is superman without kryptonite and this makes this character so boring and lacklustering other than captain marvel  the supporting cast are good but the directors could not able to use them in a proper way and coming to nick fury the way he lost his eye omg its a disrespect to this character and even how avengers got its name makes me feel irritating i thought captain america was the first avenger scarlet witch black widow and gamoras origin stories would have been more interesting than this blatant character
Apr 1 2019,neutral,a  nice marvel movienot crazy good  not crazy bad
Apr 1 2019,neutral,decent for a marvel movie not the best but not the worst either i prefer this over any captain america or incredible hulk films but to tell the truth wonder woman did it so much better than this
Apr 1 2019,negative,movie was ok the big problem for me was captain marvel she seemed so uninteresting as a character and reminded me of the girl from the twilight movies 
Apr 1 2019,positive,it was a very good origin story now cant  wait to see avengers end game
Apr 1 2019,negative,really disappointed by this movie it was slow and had many annoying dialogues the main actress is quite plain this movie had so much potential fury and the cat were the best partsz
Apr 1 2019,positive,really enjoyed the movie and thought brie larson did a great job
Apr 1 2019,positive,it was a little boring and kiddy at some points but overall pretty good not a bad solo movie 
Apr 1 2019,positive,theres one thing that keeps this from being really great  it basically means all the foes faced by the aveners team were trash at no point was fury so concerned about the planet that he tapped in cpt marvel and that makes this movie a retcon killer for all the other movies
Apr 1 2019,negative,frankly the worst mcu movie the lead actor performance is horrible i find it extremely political and totally not fun to watch is marvel losing the plot saddest part this actor will be in end game  
Apr 1 2019,neutral,kind of boring  there was never a moment she was in danger lame comedy and dont make mo check er video about it
Apr 1 2019,positive,a fun way to spend a couple hours brie larson 
Apr 1 2019,neutral,it feels like in an effort to catch up to endgame it doesnt give itself time to tell its own story though the few times it gives itself time to breath the characters have great chemistry and has some impressive action scenes but this film ultimately feels irrelevant apart from required watching for captain marvels origin
Mar 31 2019,positive, very entertaining not the best marvel movie ever but it is definitely worth watching and its a great segue into endgame a typical origin story 
Mar 31 2019,negative,captain marvel is one of the bad movies in the mcu it kinda feels like iron man 2 only that larson isnt potraying a very likeable hero carol danvers was really a letdown personality wise i just hope they change her personality a little during endgame andor cm2
Mar 31 2019,positive,this movie is so good the trolling of white men be damned they need to get on board and recognize there is an issue with representation if they want to act like little man babies because women want a fair shot then so be it this movie was truly life changing for me and every little girl and boy out there need to see it asap 
Mar 31 2019,negative,real heroes dont call themselves hero  if your actions make you deserving of that characterisation then that is what others will call you  i waited for this movie for a long time ive been a fan of carol danvers character for a long time unfortunately what we got is a poorly written exceedingly obvious retcon that is an insult to fans of both the character and the rest of the mcu  the other origin movies like captain america and iron man show us a real origin and establish character taking a few creative liberties while attempting to stay true to the source material we get to see how they develop what their motivations are what makes them heroic etc captain marvel dives right into the more recent iteration of the character completely butchers and completely omits critical details of her history  what this does is create a shallow mockery of a much more interesting hero   even the title of captain marvel has no substance because the name is an homage as well as an honor but we dont get to see why because her progression is subverted   the writers took a character that definately derserves a place in the mcu but chose to do such a horrible job that it feels forced and insincere   the effects are great but making it flashy doesnt make up for the poor casting and sub par writing compared to other movies in the franchise
Mar 31 2019,negative,this is the 3rd time posting a review after having it deleted movie is terrible bad acting bad script bad hero dont waste your time or money
Mar 31 2019,negative,bad acting bad  story
Mar 31 2019,positive,an exciting pseudotwist on the marvel formula this flick makes the most of its roots and turns heads with visual flair and emotional punches in a way that feels genuine thanks largely to larsens charisma and the smart use of indie drama talent in the directors chairs
Mar 31 2019,negative,i have nothing to do with the outside politics when reviewing this film ant man and the wasp and captain marvel were to me both bland filmsant man and the wasp having better humour and characters however captain marvel was heavily advertised as a movie that would change everything we knew about the mcu i didnt have much faith in this movie as the source material never portrayed carol danvers as a likable character as she could always the most harsh and militarised person in the room so for me she would work as a morally ambiguous heroine whos end justify the means the movie depicts this overconfident character with all her flaws but never suggests that these are character flaws but rather her strengths    two of the reasons the mcu is successful is that we trust the marvel studios to deliver on great character and relationships this movie jumps from star force to fury to maria to good skrolls never giving a chance to create a well rounded full character or meaningful relationship the second reason is that we have the layout for storylines thanks to the comics which are famous and beloved a reason or in captain marvels case disliked for a reason the skrolls kree war is a through line and constant within the marvel comics with no good sides and villain being war itself secret invasion is one of the most iconic storylines but is now tainted by seeing the meekness of the scrolls and  incompetence of the kree the story could be done later but the menace of skrolls is diminished as ill always think of them of victims with the best comedic moments in captain marvel captain marvel has been reboot for 6 times for a reason and that she cannot carry a story by herslef and barely with a team
Mar 31 2019,negative,even though i was excited to see the movie   when i heard it was coming to cinema i was   disappointed in the delivery flat unemotional   and downright boring i hope this is not the   future of the mcu
Mar 31 2019,neutral,did not find the movie to be very interesting although it did have its moments some of the comedy was good but several times they tried to reach for it i found myself drawn to the lead scroll character as he was able to show a lot of emotion yet at the same time use humor and sarcasm to create great moments
Mar 31 2019,negative,i had high hopes for this movie but it was clear the writers or directors or both just didnt know how to handle this character the movie went from a memory loss film to a buddy cop movie to alien invasion with a twist that was lacked importance then the twist became the driving force of the plot brie larsons acting was disappointing and was carried by every other actor in the film i loved monica rambeau especially i was disappointed by a lot of decisions in this movie like how she got her powers and how fury losses his eye id rather black widow or scarlet witch take over as the female leader of the mcu i care far more about those characters than i do about brie larsons captain marvel nothing in this movie truly made me want her to be the new lead of the mcu i didnt care for this film or its decisions however i believe that it had some enjoyable parts but i wouldnt rewatch it people can like this movie all they want but it just didnt make me care for it the same way i didnt care for thor the dark world or batman v superman if you want to see a powerful woman coming to know herself and her strength watch wonder woman it made me care about diana
Mar 31 2019,negative,ugh crap storyline the lead actressï 12 12tm portrayal of the main character lacks charisma for some reason i couldnï 12 12tmt relate to her as a hero character or even just as a human being in the mcu this is one of the reasons why comic book films nowadays just makes me feel fatigued
Mar 31 2019,positive,the most marvel movie out there the plot is barely there the pacing struggles to move forward at times and the main characters personality does not live up to what marvel has done in the past decade its obvious that everyone is doing the best they can with the material that they had which does make the experience a lot more bearable
Mar 31 2019,positive,excellent in all respects  a superhero movie with real heart and humor larson is terrific thoroughly enjoyable
Mar 31 2019,positive,brie larson was charming and her chemistry with samuel l jackson was great add to that the 90s nostalgia and cute kitty stuff and you have a real fun movie one of the best mcu origin movies for sure
Mar 31 2019,negative,sorry but was bored the entire time watching it
Mar 31 2019,positive,it was funny really enjoyed watching
Mar 31 2019,positive,as a prequel or side story to any marvel universe it works but as a solo movie not so much it is just like the marvel version of wonder woman but wasnt as good as that there are some good action scenes and drama and laughs and everything you want to see but nothing that makes it stand out from any of the other marvel movies that i have seen i didnt like that cat being like an alien that was dumb captain marvel did a good job and nick fury also has a lot to say it was kind of stupid that is scars are by a cat and not something an old boss but a good edition to the marvel movies and hope to see what happens in the last avengers hell ya
Mar 31 2019,negative,the movie wasted a ton of potential by turning the skrulls into something other than the villians they were when they first appeared in the fantastic four
Mar 31 2019,negative,brie just wasnt the right person for the role  samuel jacksons performance prevented the movie from falling flat
Mar 31 2019,positive,more interesting than wonder woman which was awful nice artificial works to make sam jackson and clark gregg look younger nicely complicated villains
Mar 31 2019,positive,personally i thought captain marvel was amazing beautiful animation a lot of references to small details in the mcu i think a reason people find it boring is because they put an origin story in the middle of a climax everyone just got off infinity war now anxiously waiting for endgame so i can see why it would feel like a weird buffer i actually havent seen inifity war yet gasp yes ik so i was really able to enjoy this like i have all the other originsfirst stand alones if it were to have come out sooner i think more people could say hers stands evenly with the thor iron man doctor strange etc
Mar 31 2019,negative,  a regular movie that does not even come close to what it promised
Mar 31 2019,negative,horrid and useless
Mar 31 2019,negative,the movie was fairly cheesy and full of plotholes when you watch all the other mcu movies
Mar 31 2019,neutral,sometimes entertaining and sometimes boring about the worst thing a superhero movie can be is boring  i am not a fan of this character but thought brie larson did a decent job
Mar 31 2019,positive,dont get all the girl power hate im a masculine guy and i enjoyed it laughed a lot not as much as thor ragnarok but a good amount good addition to the marvel family 
Mar 31 2019,positive,fun addition to the marvel cinematic universe
Mar 31 2019,positive,i liked it it explained a lot the last 5 mins seemed unnecessary 
Mar 31 2019,positive,i thought the movie was solid all around captain marvel was a stoic warrior who seems well suited to the mcu and seeing young nick fury was a delight hard to say more then that without spoiling the ending the only thing it needed to bump up the score was to have a threat that was actually challenging to the protagonist it suffered a bit like age of ultron in that regard
Mar 31 2019,positive,loved the movie  i loved seeing carol danvers pick herself up and dust herself off no matter how she might fail  the sured way to make sure i succeeded at something growing up was to tell me that i couldnt do it  i loved the references to top gun  go goose  i loved the music  i wasnt a comic book fan  so i cant vouch for how this fits into the marvel universe  myself my wife and my teenage daughter loved the movie  one thing for ms brie larson  that the press needs more objectivity and balance is not a new issue  people have been saying this for as long as i can remember  you can say that there needs to be more balance without implying that hate is involved       or not involved  however the movie was great  ignore any controversy and go see the movie  you will enjoy it
Mar 31 2019,negative,incoherent and disjointed so many character motivations were unclear and so much of the plot was incomprehensible the deaging of sam jackson and agent coulson looked amazing and there were some cool action moments but the storyline was so convoluted i found it very difficult to enjoy the vast majority of this film
Mar 31 2019,positive,for a super hero film not bad but this was supposed to be an epic film and it just didnt make it to that however it was entertaining enough to watch and expect avengers to be even better
Mar 31 2019,positive,i saw it twice in theaters its that good
Mar 31 2019,negative,they made a marvel movie just for feminists its a heresy for all original miss marvel fans and nick fury original history
Mar 31 2019,positive,i have already watched this a multiple times and i can say that it is such a great movie i could not imagine someone else portraying captain marvel other than brie larson she is a perfect choice her acting skills and confidence is beyond amazing now i cannot get enough of her and i need to see this part 2 soon
Mar 31 2019,positive,pretty good overall funny action packed and beautiful cgi and makeup i think it was a little unfair judged because just like iron man 1 captain america the first avenger ironic name now and especially thor 1 its an origin story so its full of exposition and doesnt quite have its legs even more so since it has way more to live up to than the first few marvel movies that came out did not to mention is has the incredibly hard job of bridging together with endgame it was a good movie had powerful messages and is definitely worth a rewatch
Mar 31 2019,negative,bored and repetitive
Mar 31 2019,positive,when you say im watching a marvel movie this means something a stellar cast comedic timing near perfect story weak villain emotional protagonist that has some forced connection with the antagonist and a stan lee cameo well all of this elements are present with oscar winning lead brie larson and her chemistry with flawless samuel l jackson will make this movie worth a watch but a super emotional lead and a weak villain with blatant cgi war between 2 alein races can make you want to leave the theatre i know a marvel movie but with flawless samuel l jackson cat and marvels heartfelt tribute to stan lee will make it worth a watch ps near perfect post credit scene
Mar 31 2019,positive,pretty good introduction to the characters and addition to the franchise
Mar 31 2019,negative,mediocre film the main character has no faults which made it boring to watch the villains if you can call them that were portrayed as being weak so no steaks helen slater in the 1984 supergirl film had more emotional range than the lead here
Mar 31 2019,positive,i caught this again on the weekend the first time since the cinema the film is plagued with cliché model storytelling and as an origin film its not that eventful this film is a gap filler for avengers endgame and the film has an endgame destination not a great marvel film but not a horrible film theres many more bad comic book movies out there this just aint one of them larson is a little miscast in the role but that could be from the storyline time will tell as this warrants a sequel 08032020    as a captain marvel fan this film fails to ignite her and comes across as a giant feminism driven plot on the plus side i would like to see young girls going to the cinema and seeing a character like this but this is no wonder women this fits loosely in the marvel universe and opens up a lot of plot issues by having a character so powerful missing for so long maybe a sequel will solve these the true reason for this film is the connection to avengers end game larson is well cast and is extremely talented its almost a shame seeing her in a film of this stature she might be attempting to raise her profile and this will succeed in doing so but at what cost there are a lot of trolls and anti feminist protestors out there and larson is very outspoken with this passion i personally didnt love the film but i get the forced nature of the plotting it is time for change the central storyline of getting back up is the key for all the little girls out there and thats one message everybody can use not my ideal captain marvel storyline or film but it ends with the character in full swing for endgame 19032019
Mar 31 2019,negative,the movie was boring and flat and even if it did tie some things in its still just an eye sore on the great legacy that once was marvel idc about a girl lead or anything or even that the actress is so annoying and irritating offscreen its the fact on how the movie was done and how she didnt really work for anything its was just some bland movie that made me feel like i was watching some kinda indie ripoff with good effects
Mar 31 2019,negative,bad lazy writing poor story telling boring 
Mar 31 2019,positive,great story great performance great retro vibes great chemistry between danvers and fury great cat great surprises super great hype for avengers endgame
Mar 31 2019,negative,as a woman i was initially excited for this movie   but then i saw it  the story overall falls very flat carol danvers is marketed heavily as a strong female character but she is anything but   this movie taught me that in order to be a strong female you cannot carry any weaknesses   to be a strong female you cannot have any flaws   and finally to be a strong female you must dominate over men   carol danvers had no heart no weaknesses no flaws and her only conflict was to dominate over men which she somehow achieved very easily  if she had been more affected by her misunderstanding with the skrulls if she have felt even an ounce of guilt for killing the skrulls in the past then i might have been able to resonate with her but she breezes past this revelation like it is nothing because the film wanted to keep the underlying agenda that women do not have flaws and do not have anything to feel guilty about   conclusion captain marvel is not a strong female character  a strong female character is a woman that has flaws but manages to triumph over them anyways
Mar 31 2019,negative,one of worst marvel filmsplease dont ruin end game
Mar 31 2019,negative,the movie wasnt that good im disappointed in marvel captain america is the first avenger should have saved my money for shazam
Mar 31 2019,positive,fun and way better than the trailers made it look  a great movie far from it but a fun mcu movie for sure
Mar 31 2019,negative,captain marvel is so boring i never was worried about her no tension shes way to powerful to even care and the actor show almost no emotions iin the movie it is one of the most worse marvel movies made if there was anything to show yeah shes powerful but even she strugle against evil this move suck it is a chore to watch
Mar 31 2019,positive,it was a fine superhero movie i guess i bought into the prerelease hype and figured it would be a lot more impressive than it is again it was a fine movie but not great or even memorable
Mar 31 2019,negative,visually it was an ok movie definitely not the cringefest i was warned about but it most certainly has its moments i do not feel that any one actor actress added to my disenjoyment of this movie as even the greatest actor cannot work with a garbage script story and i feel ms larson gave it her best these 2 stars are hers the movie as a whole is awkwardly bland and i cannot really pick any stand out moments to even praise criticize from any entertaining standpoint it was fun but meh 25
Mar 31 2019,negative,overall a good but not great movie  good  special effects are fun  fury is awesome all the easter  eggs are great   ill have to rent it at some point to watch again for the easter eggs    bad  captain mar vel switches sides far too quickly for me  she is all for the kree side then the bad guy says hey im not bad your friends are bad while he is lying to her about his real reasons and she thinks for like 2 seconds and says ok i switch sides  ugh   i also think her powers are too inconsistent   she cant blast the handcuffs but can blast a hole in the ship  she blasts some people and they die and she blasts others and they get back up       overall fun but not great  middle to low middle of the mcu films
Mar 31 2019,positive,i was warned by family and friends shes too powerful  aw nuts  she played the part to the hilt  swagger selfassuredness intelligence  the other actors were good support  good fun
Mar 31 2019,positive,i went in with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised enjoyable movie
Mar 31 2019,neutral,worse than expected no argument no special effects just watch it to follow marvels story
Mar 31 2019,negative,this is the worst mcu movie to date it has no story of its own instead it merely rides the coattails of the world built by the 20 prior movies the pacing is terrible the dialogue is lacking and brie larson is seemingly incapable of showing any emotion to bring the secondrate character to life you will not miss anything if you dont see it
Mar 31 2019,positive,thoroughly enjoyed this movie
Mar 31 2019,negative,not even the least bit of fun
Mar 31 2019,positive,i watched captain marvel in the theatresit was definitely a nice movie and brie larson performance was just fabulousthe comedy and action scenes were the most enjoyable
Mar 31 2019,negative,boring and lifeless complete waste of my time
Mar 31 2019,negative,no good   brie larson should have never been cast for this role   why could they not have spent more time and found someone like wonder woman   now she was a phenomenal lead actress that brought honesty sincerity and is not a self centered pompous spoiled brat
Mar 31 2019,negative,dont like the way they retcon the universe because of her character
Mar 31 2019,negative,2 hour long borefest no character journey goose and nick fury are the best part of this snoozefest
Mar 31 2019,negative,a fairly boring and uninspired origin story that looks amazing at times yet manages to fail on almost every other level from a lazy direction awkward use of 90s pop culture and music stiff acting from brie larson and terrible clichã c changes to the source material captain marvel does not deliver on the promises made to the fans of the marvel cinematic universe and looks to be the black sheep of the infinity saga barely essential to see i would advise to only watch it if you are a completist and wish to check it off your mcurelated bucket list while waiting for avengers endgame    surely this movie will fade into obscurity as quickly as all of its troubles arose good riddance brie we hardly knew ye
Mar 31 2019,negative,although cpt marvel wasnâtmt a terrible origin movie it lacked that wow factor many other marvel movies have the animation was amazing and the story was great but the jokes were a bit cheesy and the pc was unnecessary
Mar 31 2019,positive,a movie with a great plot twist and friendship between fury and danvers but a dragged start and a failed tentative to be in specific scenes a guardians of the galaxy that this movie is not it everything available to be a great movie but it didnt enjoyed the benefits of making a movie in the 90s soundtrack not memorable at all and a visual that is not too styled enough the screenplay is good not to complain about that
Mar 31 2019,positive,surprisingly loved this movie am looking forward to seeing what comes next
Mar 31 2019,neutral,top 5 worst mcu movies kind of reminded of the superman 2006 no actual plots just super power running around acting badass
Mar 31 2019,negative,the lack of character development of captain marvel is evident
Mar 31 2019,positive,finally saw this film i absolutely loved it finally getting kickass women who are great roll models i loved how furey lost his eye goosebri did a great job on par with and above most marvel films haters goons hate but thereï 12tms no reason not to love it the pace was good story line characters very pleased
Mar 31 2019,neutral,disappointment and a little boring
Mar 31 2019,positive,going into this film i had questions about brie larsons casting but expected a great story that fed off the current state of the mcu turns out i had that back asswards larson fit the role perfectly and puts on a great performance but the story is pretty lazy and the humor is disappointingly corny especially when you consider how surprisingly funny marvel movies are capable of being i also hope future movies include a patch that sees a captain marvel nerf just to keep things interesting but at the same time i enjoy watching action sequences of her overpowering everything in her way this film is like a cheese platter the brie almost saves it but in the end its just an average appetizer to the main course that is end game
Mar 31 2019,negative,mehnice to meet u carol cant wait till u just join the team already
Mar 31 2019,neutral,it passed the time but the plot execution wasnt very good and what they were doing with different things in this movie took away opprotunities for future marvel movies
Mar 31 2019,positive,very good movie the characters are all likable carols and furys chemistry is off the charts loved the skrulls and the cat and yet the movies biggest strength is the story which is refreshing and original
Mar 31 2019,negative,very mediocre only watch it for sam jackson goose the cat and chris evans end credit scene
Mar 31 2019,negative,hands down the worst picture in the mcu  bad script bad acting lots of plot holes and no character development  brie larsonï 12 12tms title character was unlikeable
Mar 31 2019,negative,captain marvel was pretty dull and boring it felt like a made for tv movie if you havent watched it yet dont waste your money wait for it on netflix or network tv
Mar 31 2019,positive,saw it twice i really appreciated larsonï 12tms acting even more the second time good movie
Mar 31 2019,positive,was not sure going into the movie was very pleasantly surprised awesome movie  love how they filled in so many missing pieces makes me excited to see the last avengers movie   one of the better stand alone marvel movies
Mar 31 2019,positive,one of the better marvel movies ive seen
Mar 31 2019,positive,great build up piece for endgame i liked the captain marvel backstory and the franchise seems strong enough to warrant a sequel the only thing i wasnt sold on here was brie larsons performance in this particular rooe it was good but whether it was her or the director it did not have enough emotional resonanxe or intensity for me i just did not feel like she owned the character anywhere close to other actors have thus far in the mcu however the movie did a lot of other things well such as drawing on 80s nostalgia supplying strong supporting cast and characters and creating a pretty solid plot that includes the signature marvel twist
Mar 31 2019,positive,while the beginning is very dull captain marvel seriously picks up afterwards not the best marvel movie but a satisfying one
Mar 31 2019,neutral,good movie nice balance of action and drama
Mar 31 2019,negative,i watched this movie because it it has a superhero that will answer the distress call from nicky fury shown in infinity war but this is the worst movie in india released in 2019 by a foreign studio given that there are big budget hindi action movies in 2019 marvel needs to do way better most uninspiring lead    vies
Mar 31 2019,positive,come on people what an awesome story and shes such an amazing and down to earth person 
Mar 31 2019,positive,a solid 4 brie larson is pretty cool
Mar 31 2019,positive,another solid marvel movie
Mar 31 2019,positive,everyone this movie is decent but let me start with this i do not like the politics for the marketing of this film i followed it and am very disappointed with marveldisney and rotten tomatoes especially now lets talk about the movie the positives great vfx great supporting characters goose was great and had a different idea for plot but i do not feel it was executed properly my personal opinion the negatives brie larsons performance fell flat at times when she was performing good it was good must give credit where credit is due jude laws character was under used captain marvel not having any weakness or struggle in the closing fight battle whatever is a little disappointing and me personally feel connection to carol as truly their was not much character development if we are being honest overal not a bad movie had some pros had some cons fun time once it speeds up 
Mar 31 2019,negative,one of the worst mcu movies bad action fights horrible storyline and 0 charismatic charactersvillains
Mar 31 2019,positive,i thought it was entertaining the political correctness was held in check for the most part unlike black panther where its shoved down your throat 
Mar 31 2019,negative,apart from goose the cat i didnt think think much of this moviethere was no real journey the movie i think needed a more likeable actress like emily blunt or something i think its been overhyped for entertainment value it providesits not bad just not great
Mar 31 2019,negative,ill admit that im somewhat over the marvel movies in general but ive decided to see them through until endgame that said captain marvel would rank on the lower end of the mcu movies for me the dialogue was terrible humor didnt connect for me the 90s references especially in the beginning felt forced and brie larsons acting was terrible this was kind of a surprise as i dont think of her as a bad actress at all the villains skrulls felt more like comic relief early on and the twist was predictable i did find myself laughing at parts that are not meant for laughter so i suppose there is that im also not fully bought into captain marvel being all powerful  the way i saw it she can fly and shoot energy from her hands cant a bunch of other heroes do the same thing    maybe im just burnt out on these mcu movies in general but i couldve walked out of the theatre and been fine this one is probably better to rent just to get caught up before endgame
Mar 31 2019,neutral,you see it today you forget it tomorrow  barely average
Mar 31 2019,negative,the original captain marvel is better
Mar 31 2019,negative,this film makes other better mcu characters weaker in order to prop up a fraud the films terribly writing filled with phony feminism and it negatively impacts the mcus continuity
Mar 31 2019,negative,one of the worst mcu movies ever made horrible story no character development ruined nick fury and how he lost his eye just ugh terrible
Mar 30 2019,positive,i absolutely loved captain marvel and found it to be incredibly inspiring and more downtoearth than other marvel films
Mar 30 2019,positive,captain marvel stars brie larson as the superhero as carol danvers  marvel did another great job casting brie as a strong willful and charismatic and fun character we could all love  we find out how jackson lost his eye and several other loopholes in the marvel universe  hopefully we get to see how this movie will tie to the avengers end game   i didnâtmt understand why this movie had so many negative reviews i thought it was very good  i believe captain marvel is a mixture of wonder woman and supergirl with clues that referenced brie with danvers sisters  she could be the long lost sister with no negative superpowers  she is the ultimate superhero we didnâtmt know much about  there was also top gun references with their nicknames from the air force academy  overall it was a good strong feminine  superhero you got to see it on the big screen
Mar 30 2019,positive,i loved every minute such a great movie for all the girls to see very empowering
Mar 30 2019,positive,loved it im excited for my daughter to see it
Mar 30 2019,positive,pretty spectacular nick furys role is amazing the action is pretty darn cool this movie is certainly rewatchable
Mar 30 2019,negative,it was like watching a superman film if superman had no weaknesses from the moment it started you just thought welp yup she is strong k next
Mar 30 2019,negative,horrible movie i never been so ready for a movie to be over with my son didnt even enjoy the movie or my niece they were ready to go saying how boring it was 
Mar 30 2019,positive,i really enjoy a strong femalecentric story that is without the romance or damselindistress act women can kick ass and its shown in this wonderful movie love brie larson and her vulnerability and sweet voice act 2 and 3 of the movie is so much better than the beginning the start was a little bit too slow and draggy
Mar 30 2019,negative,what can i say just another generic marvel movie that fails to delivers with even the funny parts bland dialog bland emotional moments and pretty predictable story line actually a very predictable story line even the music choices were pretty mediocre at best the only parts that were kind of ok were the fighting scenes and even those didnt really deliver i had high hopes for this movie but it is just a big 2 hours of nothing watch it if you must keep the avengersmarvel story line knowledge but i would suggest to save your money and wait until its available on netflix of amazon prime even then make sure to drink plenty of coffee to stay awake
Mar 30 2019,neutral,were my hopes too high  cap marvel is plain and character development was low and she just came off as stuck up  it was ok but a necessary watch for marvel fans
Mar 30 2019,negative,it was just so damn boring my brother and i both almost fell asleep in the theater at different points
Mar 30 2019,positive,it was great more fun than any captain america movie
Mar 30 2019,positive,decent movie with a strong performance by brie larson but i felt as though it was lacking a certain spark that ive come to expect from marvel
Mar 30 2019,positive,thank you for finally giving me a hero who didnâtmt need to fall in love to figure herself out
Mar 30 2019,negative,bad movie dont watch
Mar 30 2019,positive,it was better from a technical stand point than black panther  but they seemed to try to artificially weaken carol danvers character so they could do a female empowerment move and honestly all it did was hold her back because the main plot had nothing to do with her being looked down on because of her gender
Mar 30 2019,positive,brie larson is terrific and the plot will make you say woah cool
Mar 30 2019,negative,very uninteresting movie plays it safe the whole way through and beats you over then head with 90s references
Mar 30 2019,positive,one of the best marvel movies ever the fact people were hating on this movie before it even came out should explain so of these bias reviews its a movie thats smart and funny i hope captain marvel is a big part of the mcu universe for years to come great job brie youre freaking hot
Mar 30 2019,negative,worse marvel movie yet
Mar 30 2019,neutral,my issue with captain marvel comes from a bias love of the comic books the movie itself is ok despite some of its plot inconsistencies in this incarnation marvel is a woman who instead of bestowing carol with cosmic power instructs her to destroy a device she created which then pseudoscience sideways grants her cosmic abilities this feels like an extra long episode of agents of shield more than an actual marvel movie the colors are dulled out costumes look power rangers grade while at the same time the story they tell is ok i do feel like it would have been a much more interesting story to see carol and nick fury do a fish out of water buddy comedy adventure vs the skrulls but thats not what happens here the feminism points are pushed heavy in this almost to the point of being too obtuse something its comparison movie wonder woman does not do and was much more successful for it there is a literal scene where she is being cat called by a motor cyclist who she ignores and then robs after shoplifting an outfit from a clothing store leaving the camera to focus in on an exposed pair of breasts this literally happens in a marvel film  a real feminist margaret thatcher said it best power is like being a lady if you have to tell people you are you arent the ending scene is cool but you literally have seen it all if youve watched the trailer and if you were expecting ronan the accuser to actually show how cool he is i advise you to expect nothing unfortunately she doesnt show any capabilities more fantastical than dr strange stronger than hulk iconic as black panther smarter than iron man strategic than captain america or powerful as thor at all so one can only imagine what they have in store
Mar 30 2019,positive,real enjoyed great solo movie w8th the mcu charm we love
Mar 30 2019,negative,most disappointed movie capitan marvel character one of the most weakest one ever created by marvel movies marvel has created heros like spider man capitan america and iron man based on this awesome characters i give zero stars to capitan marvel
Mar 30 2019,positive,really enjoyed this movie had some problems with the writing but thoroughly enjoyed it
Mar 30 2019,positive,a solid entry in the marvel lineup
Mar 30 2019,positive,really good movie not the greatest marvel movie but definitely not the worst
Mar 30 2019,positive,a fun superhero movie nothing insanely special but it adds to the storyline of the marvel universe 
Mar 30 2019,positive,great movie but slow starting
Mar 30 2019,neutral,very lackluster film this movie introduces inconsistencies to the marvel cinematic universe action scenes are poor the way nick fury looses his eye is very disrespectful to the character in terms of source material this is one of the worse live action adaptations monica rambeau was astablished well before carol danvers and is a far more likable character gender swaping marvel and other plot points are horrible overall this is one of marvels worse movies and they should not push for this film so hard only setting up the next act in the cinematic universe for failure props for the tribute to stan lee only portion of the movie that mad me smile
Mar 30 2019,negative,boring called the eye loss months before premiere way to avoid the obvious marvel
Mar 30 2019,negative,its not a hallmark channel movie 1 star  slightly better than solo and suicide squad but unfortunately worst mcu entry  i thought lots of stuff was retconned that didnt need to be  no issues with anyone in the cast  i just think the writers and directors are to blame
Mar 30 2019,negative,the worst among all mcus movie a big no no with that budget marvel could have done better with storyline and special effects
Mar 30 2019,negative,i felt that this movie had too many plot holes and  after the first half  which was decent the movie started to fall apart
Mar 30 2019,positive,okay it was really good it had great action and a big plot twist plus it had a sneak peek scene of the next movie end game in the credits
Mar 30 2019,negative,forgettable story cool special effects  i should have waited for on demand and even then it was barely worth the time  filler for lead up to endgame
Mar 30 2019,negative,literally just bad dont see it it only has good reviews because flixter is getting payed to delete them
Mar 30 2019,positive,brie larson fits right in and plays captain marvel perfectlyben mendelsohn as talos steals every scene
Mar 30 2019,positive,loved the dynamic story of captain marvel brie larson brought captain marvel alive
Mar 30 2019,neutral,kinda mediocre ben mendelsohns performance and the dynamic between brie larson and sam jackson was the only good thing in this movie
Mar 30 2019,negative,wasnt one of marvels best movies and i dont like politics shoved in my face like it was in this movie im on the fence now about endgame thank you captain marvel one movie not to remember 
Mar 30 2019,negative,least exciting movie ive ever seen also first movie ive ever fell asleep watching
Mar 30 2019,positive,pretty good introduction to the mcu i like that they didnt go full blown aventure perfect storyline to a new heroine 
Mar 30 2019,positive,i loved this movie another great movie marvel all the negative reviews about this movie are from people that probably never seen this movie but anyone who watches this movie will more then likely enjoy every minute i camt wait for it to come out on blu ray so i can watch it over and over as i do almost all the marvel movies 5 stars
Mar 30 2019,negative,with the exception of a good performance from samuel l jackson and attention to detail for the 90s time period this movie tries to hard to make you accept an unlikable character who were are supposed to believe is more powerful than thora god or hulk and the key to defeating thanos sorry but im not buying it this was false advertising in its finest and a sub par film at best for marvel without nick fury and the promise of a tie in to endgame there is nothing to keep you entertained watching this cinematic flop not certified fresh
Mar 30 2019,positive,captain marvel is directed by anna boden and ryan fleck written by anna boden ryan fleck and geneva robertsondworet and starring brie larson samuel l jackson ben mendelssohn and jude law    the story follows carol danvers as she becomes one of the universes most powerful heroes when earth is caught in the middle of a galactic war between two alien races set in the 1990s    captain marvel is an allnew adventure from a previously unseen period in the history of the marvel cinematic universe for that reason i say its a new way to see a mcu movie and its also crazy the ost the humor and the era this movie is a bonker    captain marvel is a very fun time guys its really cool fueled by cgi action sequences and the amazing performances by samuel l jackson and ben mendelssohn btw ben m is very surprising to him that great hes by far the best thing in this movie just like samuel l for me goose the cat comes at the second place i dont want to spoil anything to you about that amazing funny cat but guys prepare to get your mind blown also the cgi of samuel l jackson to make him younger is amazing this is the best agecgied character ive ever seen literally    is it a perfect movie nope it has some flaws its not a great heroine movie there are better heroine movies but its still a fun one but still flawed    my biggest issue with this movie is the first 15min guys they were superrushed even the direction was rushed theres also a scene when a team was searching for someone it was so dark that it was literally so hard to see who is doing what that scene bugged me so much it took me sometime to recognize the characters theres also a very good scene when captain marvel was trying to get those lockers out of her hands rushed but cool when captain marvel arrived earth as we saw in the trailer things finally got back to the right course it was humorous slowpaced a little bit and all the good things started to happen    and the thing that i didnt imagine to say is that brie larson is not that good as carol aka captain marvel shes a very talented actress so i expected something better from her but she was brie larson nothing more i hope to see her better in avengers endgame    its a good origin superhero movie still not that amazing with some amazing action sequences fueled by good cgi im gonna give captain marvel a b go and see it it worth your time guys and as always thank you guys for reading and supporting my work really appreciate it and if you liked it you can click on my name up above and see all of my reviews
Mar 30 2019,positive,this movie has twists and turns and will make you want to see it again and again and find new things i love this movie 
Mar 30 2019,positive,thoroughly enjoyed the movie   best intro to a marvel superhero in the mcu yet my opinion  good action good humour good pacing really liked it
Mar 30 2019,negative,super sexist why cant a superhero movie just be fun and not be about politics wonder woman was great this movie is not save your money and your time
Mar 30 2019,negative,sad when day when the most intresting characters in a marvel feilm are its suporting cast skip this one
Mar 30 2019,positive,i really enjoyed this one nice to see that it didnt just ride on the coattails of other marvel movies it was its own story brie larson was very likeable as the title character captain marvel
Mar 30 2019,negative,only unique in how uninspired it is utterly forgettable and hard to watch i just didnt like it
Mar 30 2019,negative,i didnt have any expectations of this film intentionally stayed away from other reviews and had not seen more then a couple seconds of a trailer  what i got was a lackluster experience this film offers nothing captin marvel isnt belivable as a heroine the film is preachy in an obnoxious way   i wish there was an option to give less stars    two thumbs down   save your time and money and skip this one
Mar 30 2019,negative, oh marvel shame on you
Mar 30 2019,positive,it was advertised better but the movie does have enough charm to carry itself the only downside is the excess of 90s songs played towards the end of the movie itself
Mar 30 2019,negative,boring and confusing
Mar 30 2019,negative,there is nothing important in this movie  nothing
Mar 30 2019,negative,not a very good film especially as i have loved all the other mcu films i would suggest watching shazam instead far funnier and much better acting as well
Mar 30 2019,positive,great story told of how hero became
Mar 30 2019,negative,itï 12tms good not sure if i want a sequel to a character that has no character growth possibility
Mar 30 2019,positive,date night and the wife and i really enjoyed the latest marvel movie   it explained to those who didnï 12tmt read the comics first how the avengers became who the are larson is basically the female superman to dc like a better marvel version of wonder woman   she has wit and attitude like a cleaner and female version of deadpool jackson is funny and law is surprising as well itï 12tms worth the watch and is order to be caught up in time for end game i surggest you see it in theaters probably wonï 12tmt be on bluray or streaming before april 26th donï 12tmt let the nit pickers discourage you itï 12tms a good classicly donï 12tmt marvel movie
Mar 30 2019,positive,the movie was phenomenal brie larson player carol as well as anyone could have asked for i connected with the character i understood what she was going through not because i am an undercover superhero but because the story she told was not just limited to superheroes or in this case superheroine it was the story of a woman wading through the lies she has been told that constantly tell her she needs to do things the male way and she she is not good enough when in reality as carol aptly puts it she does not have to prove anything to anyone she does not have to play by his rules she does not belong to him or his world the story of captain marvel defeating the people who keep her down is a story of empowerment in the face of oppression it is a story of achieving when the world has existed to keep you from achievement perhaps that is why so many men have difficulty understanding this film because it is not a run of the mill story     yes she is perhaps the most powerful being in the universes yes the fight scenes were jaw dropping and beautifully pulled off but it is also a story that as an ordinary person can ordinary woman an ordinary gay i can relate to this film left me on the edge of my seat crying laughing and enjoying every moment of it    thank you to everyone who worked on this film thank you
Mar 30 2019,negative,the fact that they keep removing reviews that donï 12 12tmt align with the marvel agenda is crazy     that said i didnï 12 12tmt care for the movie itï 12 12tms on the same level as and man and the wasp plenty of plot holes and continuity issues that negate the previous movies     assuming this movie isnï 12 12tmt directly required to understand endgame then i wouldnï 12 12tmt advise watching it catch it on cable maybe
Mar 30 2019,negative,nick fury story line  how he damages  his eye   how the film links to the up coming averages endgame story ark   was better than the badly put togever story ark that was cobbled togever from offer storys that was made to make the captian marvel mcu version of the hero    i am glad that the hero was brought into the mcu  the actor that was picked to play her was marvel was a poor casting choose with in the film itself and the bad press that she brought to the film  the hero as well    the fact that mar vel was changed from a  lesser hero  that was the one to try  save carol adding his dna  abilities to her but was swiched it to be like the way scarlet witch  quicksilver gained there ability from the mcu age of ultron    in endgame i hope that the undoing of the snap will bring the full marvel university into the mcu as bringing in the lost heroes as well quicksilver  aswell as the mutant that have not been in the storys due to that say professor x or some major mutant has been keeping the xmen  offer mutants under cover also could then bring the mutant into the mcu as a side fx of the infinity gauntlet with the infinity stones with  due to the reality stone  time stone that has been setup to do so due to loki  doctor strange  the ancient one or mordo  wong    but anyway the film was bad and poor story telling had some good parts but due to the lack luster of the main story ie captain marvel story ark    but was good in some of the fight scenes  odd way to gain her powers    but did end up thinking more about the next averages film in the film and what could happen more than the film keeping me in the story of the film that was being watched at the time    2 to a max of 25 but will be a 2 as the reallife bad mouthing  twitter what was said by the lead actor heres hoping that the stones can change the look of the hero and replace the actor    ps be great to see rogue and marvel to get the rogue brought into the mcu like her 90s power  problems with carol in a coma if needed or to get the 90s rogue
Mar 30 2019,positive,solid b    typical mcu origin movie a couple of surprises but nothing earthshattering   first 30 minutes are a bit clunky but once the action settles on earth it smooths out the buddycop vibe between fury and danvers was fun ben mendelsohn really steals the show especially when he shows up at maria rambeaus house and keeps his native aussie accent theres a great nod to pulp fiction here too hes as good here as alan rickman    the no doubt song used in the 3rd act was a little obvious and hamfisted alanis morissettes excellent breakup anthem you oughta know might have fit better here both thematically and tonally while not being over the top   interesting take on the skrulls that deviated on the source material however given the current political climate i can totally understand the unintended messaging consequences that would have resulted from keeping them closer to the source material and its not inconsistent with how theyve been portrayed so it works another change from their âoriginâ was likely due to a certain characters rights at the time of production its kinda sad that we didnt get a tease of a certain potential phase 4 big bad especially now that those characterâtms rights are about to revert back to marvel     theres been criticism that danvers is too wooden and lacking personality here but thats understandable given the situation shes in what with her having amnesia we saw a few hints of her human past but seeing more of her from her prekree days would have greatly helped make for a much richer character so much of steve rogers motivation  character comes from his desire to serve in ww2 and to continue to do so after his thawing out âi dont like bulliesâ but why did carol danvers join the air force especially at a time when we werent at war and when women were restricted from flying in combat the trailers suggested that a lot of time will be devoted to this part of danversâtm backstory but in the final edit this part of her character is glossed over its merely a plot point to put danvers in the right place at the right time it reminded me of hal jordan in green lantern even james rhodes âwar machineâtm a supporting character in the mcu who is also usaf with a few lines of dialog in civil warâtm we got a complete understanding of his motivations we like cao because we got to know and like steve roger before he got his abilities carol danvers deserved as much as we enter phase 4 and carol danvers is being positioned to pick up the mantle of one of the leaders of the mcu moving forward she deserves a little better than what she got here so yeah the script could have probably used one more pass and we could have spent more time with capt captain danvers usaf fingers crossed that endgame will do her justice    overall i enjoyed captain marvel im glad she wasnt shoehorned into the end of age of ultron like whedon wanted and after the endcredits preview im looking forward to seeing how she plays into endgame and beyond
Mar 30 2019,positive,an amazing movie like almost all mcu movies are with the plus that we have a strong and impressive female leader in the main hole
Mar 30 2019,negative,really didnâtmt like the movie the acting was terrible and i donâtmt understand why marvel is pushing the character on the audience itâtms not even a well liked character in the comics
Mar 30 2019,positive,this movie was freakin awesome and brie larson did fine in the roll of captain marvel and this movie wasnt to boring i guess and dont blame brie larson if you hate the movie 
Mar 30 2019,positive,it was ok but nothing special i went in with high hopes but unfortunately its one of the weakest mcu films
Mar 30 2019,negative,captain marvel was too rushed the movie seemed to be squeezed in to introduce the character in avengers end game she had no real limitations or struggle during the movie
Mar 30 2019,negative,the movie failed to provide plausible connection of cpt marvel with her environment and motivation of her actions things felt rushed with the audience having to put the effort of making the connections and assumptions action scenes were just absurd and no explanation of cpt marvels powers were given
Mar 30 2019,neutral,weak movie bad acting plot holes boring and plain wish i had asked for a refund
Mar 30 2019,neutral,i expected much more
Mar 30 2019,negative,its just a below average movie i liked fury and goose thats all i have to say
Mar 30 2019,negative,i am probably gonna stop going to disney movies they are destroying everything like like
Mar 30 2019,positive,tons of fun amazing special effects thanos watch out
Mar 30 2019,negative,marvels weakest film
Mar 30 2019,negative,unlike other marvel movies the weakest part of this movie was the main character overall just a meh movie
Mar 30 2019,negative,was disappointed by this terrible movie even the cgi was second rate at best when compared to most mcu films will not go back to see more of this superhero
Mar 30 2019,positive,love this movie a good first movie for a good character love the combination of carol and fury good jokes a nice twist and love goose
Mar 30 2019,positive,i was pleasantly surprised by captain marvel i loved brie larson as carol danvers even though the trailers cut her out to be a flat character sameul l jackson is great as always and ben mendelsohn was reaaly good in this film and i think his performance might have been the best the story was pretty decent and the action was stunning itâtms not perfect but itâtms way better than people give it credit for
Mar 30 2019,positive,captain marvel is a fun but flawed movie oscar winning actress brie larson does a impressive performance as carol danvers and samuel l jackson is wonderful as a young nick fury this is not the best entry in the marvel cinematic universe but it is still very entertaining with infectious fun
Mar 30 2019,negative,badbadbad this movie is not the usual bad assery i was expecting from marvel
Mar 30 2019,positive,awesome story line and script itï 12tmll surprise you how good it is
Mar 30 2019,positive,good movie kids loved it donâtmt listen to the haters i was a sceptic but it was a lot of fun this score should be higher
Mar 30 2019,negative,i fell asleep so it failed my is it boring test
Mar 30 2019,neutral,underwhelmed by a production of this magnitude
Mar 30 2019,positive,not a bad movie but far from the best of the mcu
Mar 30 2019,negative,the story wasnt very good and had a lack luster story
Mar 30 2019,positive,ignore the trolls  the movie was fun and fits in great with the rest of the newer mcu movies
Mar 30 2019,positive,loved this movie it was awesome
Mar 30 2019,positive,i liked it it had flaws like most marvel movies do but the good outweighed the bad brie larsen was great and i didnt think the feminism was over the top like many have complained it was
Mar 30 2019,positive,captain marvel is a solid entertaining origin story it features a good lead performance from brie larson and excellent supporting roles from samuel l jackson  ben mendelsohn the action sequences are good but not great they couldve been a bit more frequent and engaging well worth watching but not as good as previous solo origin movies such as iron man antman and doctor strange
Mar 30 2019,positive,marvels latest is a feminine film and not just because it revolves mainly around female characters and the empowering friendship and mentorship between them passing the bechdel test with flying colours but that its more emotion and narrative driven as opposed to being action orientated its understating take is refreshingly grounded with an underlying political message that draws an analogy with the refugee problem in the real world directed and cowritten by anna boden  ryan fleck with indie sensitivities this is a different kind of superhero origin story where the audience together with our suppressed heroine have to work backwards to figure out what happened and discover her real identity in spite of the duplicity and manipulation around her the script is well constructed enough to avoid contrivances and contradictions that normally annoy narrative pedants like me and if the action sequences feel pedestrian the use of cgi is subtle and unintrusive especially in the deaging of samuel l jacksons nick fury while brie larson certainly looks the part her captain marvel remains a work in progress but it is the inspired casting and layered performances of ben mendelsohn jude law and annette bening in ambiguous roles that could go either way that impress most and their past acting careers certainly help play up the friendorfoe intrigue the uniquely 90s setting provides abundant opportunities for levity and nostalgia and spotting the many cinematic homages from superman to french connection to buddy cop movies to westerns and star wars and star trek is more fun than tonal whiplash for me but above all else the biggest nod is reserved for top gun with a scenestealing cat named goose and im ultimately drawn to this appealing female superhero film which dare i say i find preferable to black panther
Mar 30 2019,positive,i loved this movie i felt pumped leaving the theater
Mar 30 2019,positive,fun movie  the whole family enjoyed it and now my girls want to grow up to be captain marvel
Mar 30 2019,positive,oh my waffles this has been my favorite movie for a while and is now my new favorite marvel movie i love that they finally made a femalecentered marvel movie good for marvel but all that aside the catgoose was the whole star of the show along wit samuel l jackson he was so funny this was the funniest marvel movie ive ever seen but they also gave it more serious moments
Mar 30 2019,negative,i actually fell asleep while watching
Mar 30 2019,positive,not the best remake off of comics but fun             benh
Mar 30 2019,neutral,it was an ok movie nothing to rave about and nothing to hate
Mar 30 2019,negative,the first third of the movie was great if the rest of the movie was like that i would give it 5 stars but unfortunatly the rest of the movie is just compleatly absurd and boring
Mar 30 2019,negative,the movie has some great moments but those were overshadowed by the propaganda that was not only unnecessary but unwanted
Mar 30 2019,positive,balancing the meter
Mar 30 2019,positive,it was a very very very well done movie not even a moment of me getting bored highly recommend to all families 
Mar 30 2019,negative,these movies are getting worse and worse after this calamity i dont think ill bother going to the next one
Mar 30 2019,negative,no heros journey shes perfect right from the beginning has multiple boring episodes one of the weaker mcu movies
Mar 30 2019,negative,captain marvel showed no growth as a character and felt robotic and dull we just want well written characters and people who can actually pass as a human to play them
Mar 30 2019,negative, that is all 
Mar 30 2019,negative,i attempted to watch this movie on the internet a cam version because i wont buy a ticket to see it in theaters after i heard what people said about this movie i got bored after 10 minutes of watching and stopped the major factor was the acting of brie larson she did not seem to have any emotions she is just badass from the start no struggle or anythingboring
Mar 30 2019,negative,its 2019 how are we still making sexist movies like this more strong female and male characters needed in lead roles when will we have the first strong female leading character in a marvel mcu film at least we have dark phoenix to look forward to the strongest marvel comic book superhero
Mar 30 2019,positive,the movie is very enjoyable the action scenes are entertaining and the performances of the actors and their chemistry amazing personally i believe it is marvels bets or origin story
Mar 30 2019,positive,this is definitely the best origin story since iron man  samuel l jackson ben mendelson  jude law and clark gregg are a strong supporting cast this character development was missing in captain america thor drstrange and the black panther  brie larson plays a fun captain marvel showing much more character than in the comic i understand the some what political overtones in the movie  the political messages in this movie were subtle enough to be enjoyable in my personal opinion  it was one of the better marvel movies i have seen in a long time definitely worth going to see especially in 3d  i understand the grievance of those that are against identity politics in entertainment like jack posobiec  however this film was relatively harmless and worth going to check out in theaters
Mar 30 2019,negative,so many chances to be a good movie so many squandered chances 
Mar 30 2019,positive,tonally uneaten but the end half of the movie was high quality
Mar 30 2019,negative,a direct to dvd script on a big budget  why did you have to do that to my boy nick fury like that  weak plot weak motivation weak character development  also why would captain marvel shoot a innocent bar owners juke box to prove to nick that she isnt a skrull when she knows nick doesnt know what a skrull is which was established 1015 minutes before this scene  why even try and make a plot twist out of the kree an already established enemy in the marvel cinematic universe its like this film wasnt intended for marvel fans
Mar 30 2019,negative,i was all in for a feminist movie if this one could be it but is not the case taking the soso script aside the movie is like a copypaste of scenes i would do on imovie many of them roughly transitioning to the next each once on a while a 90s song to remind you thats the theme even when theyre a bit forced to and like they dont even have the spice girls if they were trying to go so hard for the feminist retoric but in any case brie larson is plain boring shes emotionless and lets say thats the character still not even the action moves were that well done when she looks into the camera is like she drains your life through the screen thats how boring and uninspiring she is
Mar 30 2019,positive,this was one of the better super hero movies that i have seen in the past few years i watched it twice and yes it was entertaining both times the movie maintained my interest with a good story line great special effects and excellent music selection i thoroughly enjoyed watching captain marvel stand up to the enemies and make me believe she could defeat anyone i felt like finally here is a woman who is treated with respect and dressed equal to the men meaning she didnt have to show excessive skin highly recommend
Mar 30 2019,neutral,its was alright fight scenes were good along with the little comedy bits throughout the movie but the main problem i have with it is how clique it is for example her backstory the mustang camaro bit and just the backstory for characters basically in parts it just drones on and on to the point i got distracted and started thinking about this weekends f1 race but if you a marvel fan its kinda must to see but to end it off i did like the indiana jones bit
Mar 30 2019,negative,probably the worst mcu film iï 12 12 12tmve seen cat was good and cgi was good but acting was poor action scenes were not on par with all other mcu movies and main character is not likeable or believable sheï 12 12 12tms no wonder woman i didnï 12 12 12tmt buy her fight scenes at all and she runs funny am sure sheï 12 12 12tms a good actress in ur own right  but she fails at playing tuff and ruins the mcu i can only hope she doesnï 12 12 12tmt have big role in end game itï 12 12 12tms bad enough knowing she has more movies of this calabre coming
Mar 30 2019,positive,loved it  im a die hard marvel fan and this reminded me why  probably one of my favourite films in the franchise  danvers is stoic without being made of cardboard naturally charismatic and great to watch  lots of lovely little easter eggs the best of which is when shes dealing with her lost memories of being part of a fighter pilot program smashes through a ceiling of the blockbuster video and picks up that old twovhs copy of the right stuff then gives the cover a small smile  great fun and best of all it passes the bechdel test the mako mori test and the furiosa test 
Mar 30 2019,negative,worst mcu movie to date
Mar 30 2019,positive,waited to see this movie to formulate my own opinion and its fine its not great and its not terrible  its middle of the road for the mcu i would place it among antman  the wasp and say the incredible hulk
Mar 30 2019,positive,good movie fits well into the mcu
Mar 30 2019,negative,fell asleep through it
Mar 30 2019,negative,painfully boring flat story confusing  and unlikable hero kinda feel cheated and nervous on how it will be integrated to end game just have to wait and see i fear for the future of the mcu
Mar 30 2019,negative,it just wasnt good its that simple she was awful and flat and i boring and annoying and she was most of the movie soit wasnt good 
Mar 30 2019,negative,not a completely terrible movie but with a lead actress who is upstaged by a cgi cat need i say more
Mar 30 2019,negative, reserve revolves around a female character but does not show how she is strong neither how she got it 
Mar 30 2019,negative,ok so i just wrote a very lengthy review and it deleted immediately nice not a good movie random fact so you know i saw it the skrull are family oriented       very disappointed on rotten tomatoes
Mar 30 2019,negative,as a marvel super hero fan this is just boring beyond expectations
Mar 30 2019,negative,very dry movie and acting however the cg was impressive there were many times in the movie where humour was implemented and this was the first time watching a marvel movie in the cinema in complete silence as no one else seemed to find it funny either main character isnt very likeable and comes across extremely overly confident entitled and privileged from start to finish zero struggle whatsoever
Mar 30 2019,negative,the movie is lifeless the actress is so dry im disappointed that they imposed a strong women character rather than a women with a strong character that wonder women and alita battle angel showed us
Mar 29 2019,positive,i love this movie i am such a big fan of captain marvel now
Mar 29 2019,negative,boring was lured to watch it as filler before avengers endgame but it was totally not required a waste of money
Mar 29 2019,negative,the lack of an engaging plot and boring characters made this movie brutal to sit through despite half the audience snoring in the background i would place this amongst the ranks of iron man 3 or thor dark world the fact that a cat is the most engaging character in the entire film speaks for itself while samuel jackson portrayed his character as nick fury as exceptionally as he has throughout his mcu appearances this was a major step back for marvel studios
Mar 29 2019,negative,the movie is overall very cartoony looking and theres so much fx
Mar 29 2019,negative,a lame movie i was hoping something close to alita but i cannot be more dissapointed poor acting lame characters handed powers a copycat story i hope i havent spend money on it
Mar 29 2019,positive,loved it captain marvel is a great movie brilliant lead character lots of action  and her super powers are brilliant really looking forward to seeing the character in endgame 
Mar 29 2019,negative,very bad acting and bad cgi not upto the mark of marvel movie looks like they made movie out of scraps from infinity war and endgame residue budget
Mar 29 2019,negative,entirely unnecessary unless you purchase entertainment for reasons of gender equity  i dont  the sole reason to wait through this movie is for samuel l but even then his dramatic story about losing an eye back in cap america 2 gets peed on  its actually a dumb thing that happens  give this one a miss
Mar 29 2019,negative,worst marvel movie in my opinion
Mar 29 2019,negative,this movie left so much to be desired where was carol danvers character arc she was powerful the whole time the cat and nick fury pretty much carried the whole movie wonder woman had so much better character development
Mar 29 2019,positive,amazing and a must see
Mar 29 2019,negative,have seen the movie while the side characters are full of life i feel like the protagonist didnt at all and at modt times didnt even seem relatable in any way the special effects are really good but the plot of the movie seemt confussingly simple there was no point in time where the protagonist had to look at herself and see her weak parts its s like she doesnt have any didnt like it sorry the cat was good though so make a movie about the cat alone
Mar 29 2019,negative,devoid of any real emotion form the main character worst mcu movie too many timeline inconsistencies to list
Mar 29 2019,negative,a story about a female bullied by males throughout her life and ultimately fighting against an evil government in order to save illegal aliens from extinction  given the current state of politics in the us this movie is definitely a propaganda film straight out of california  if i ignored both the direct and metaphoric analogies about politics scattered about this film there would be nothing to review except for the endcredits scene which seems to be a random scene thrown in lastminute from the upcoming avengers endgame film  allinall this film is a great example of forcing down a political view down an audienceâtms throat
Mar 29 2019,negative,this movie has no pacethe worst mcu movie yet my daughters fell asleep halfway throughthe only positives were the catand we got the tickets for free from my wifes work group
Mar 29 2019,positive,grate starts off a little fast and it takes you 20 min to catch up but after that its really good
Mar 29 2019,negative,slow and boring good scenes few and far apart
Mar 29 2019,negative,so i just watched the movie and i am sorry to report that the movie fails  and that is hard for me to say since i love marvel movies but this movie dissapointed bad enough that it warranted me to put this out there  simply put the movie falls short way way way short on many many points and failed to deliver a satisfying movie     the story is clumsy and feels pieced together  parts of the movie dragged on needlessly or do nothing to add to the would be adventure the acting was just okay  the stakes barely hovered off the ground and i barely had a connection to the lead  not to rant but seriously im actually this dissapointed where this matters enough  so first what the heck happened to fury he was a wimp using a kid friendly word there all throughout all the mcu he is a kick butt guy and here he is a tame and mild guy  really  i get it he is shown here before hulk and iron man but really he needed a liitle more shaft shut yo mouth in him    i kept waiting for the actual movie to start but before i knew it it was over and oh capt marvel has powers and saves the day wahoooooo  so second  dude those powers they were supposed to be like whoa but they were never really shown off or showcased or showboated not really at least    i was really really hoping for more and was disappointed instead the movie had its moments but dang this movie sucked as a whole and i like brie larson   in all of this i just have to say i feel cheated out of what could have been a much better movie   third and then some   gimme more 90s pop gimme a more kick butt fury gimme a more monica friend back story even gimme more agent coulson back story gimme more carol back story standing strong  gimme a true kick butt power show off and really spoiler thats how he lost his eye   meh i know which movie im leaving out of my movie collection
Mar 29 2019,negative,wasnt satisfied
Mar 29 2019,positive,it was just okay i am a huge marvel fan as well as my kids this movie had some exciting fight scenes and some comedy from samuel jackson but overall it was on par with thor 2 or iron man 2
Mar 29 2019,negative,meh character build up story
Mar 29 2019,positive,such a wonderful movie very different from other superhero origin story really love how brie larson embodied captain marvel women are emotional but strong this is very emposwering i feel more confident and stronger as a woman after watching it thanks to marveldisney for selecting brie kudos to everyone in captain marvel
Mar 29 2019,neutral,510 movie a lot of bad choices were made that were not crucial to the plot
Mar 29 2019,positive,the movie was good not the greatest i have seen
Mar 29 2019,negative,mainly just brie larson walking around for 2 hours with her fists clenched and acting snooty  overall not that good
Mar 29 2019,positive,my 7yo son and i saw this and we both loved it especially his reaction at some of the throwbacks from my childhood i love how marvel has woven all these separate stories together and my kiddo loved goose his reaction to goose near the end was the best im disappointed in all the manbaby comments this movie is getting it was fantastic i would for sure go see it again and i cant wait to see her kick some a in endgame
Mar 29 2019,negative,eh it was alright nothing to call home about
Mar 29 2019,negative,boring the stars are for stan lees memorial intro
Mar 29 2019,positive,captain marvel delivers a lot of the things that i love in every other mcu movie it has good action great cgi humor and likable heroes it is an important piece of the puzzle as we approach avengers end game because it establishes the history of carol danvers before bringing her in as a deus ex machina i was a bit worried about the movie taking place in the 90s because i didnt want it to feel like a prequel but since this is the first time we are meeting the character on screen it wasnt too bad there were certainly some prequellike references to things that would pop up in many of the other films and that was only moderately successful sometimes it was just a cute wink to the fans but other times it felt like they were trying too hard as an avid fan of the entire franchise i still enjoyed most of these small moments but i think the film could have worked without any of them the story of captain marvel isnt all that original but the way it handles the kreeskrull war was fascinating i was delighted that they didnt go completely down the expected path and offered some surprises even for fans of the comics and any time you introduce shapeshifters into your mythology there is great potential for future surprises so there was a good story in this film the sad part is that it wasnt the story of the main character i could see the potential in the story of carol danvers when they showed brief flashes of her history but because thats all we get it makes it terribly difficult to form emotional investment in her past this neutering of the emotional core of her story makes the climax also lose some potency we dont truly experience her history of being oppressed so seeing her rise above that oppression loses its power i still liked brie larson in the lead role and i thought she did some interesting things to portray the blend of human emotion with kree dispassion it just felt like the script let her down and didnt allow her as many wow moments as you want from the hero she is quippy and certainly becomes superpowered but i wanted to love her character more than the story warranted on the other hand this is probably the best appearance of nick fury to date samuel l jackson is simply delightful in the film and constantly brings the laughs he is more casual and laidback which fits his younger persona but also is clever and three steps ahead of most other characters i loved that he acted like a real spy and you could see how he slowly develops the more cautious demeanor we see in the other films captain marvel is in the lowertier of mcu films but for me that still means it is thoroughly entertaining and better than some of the best films in many other franchises
Mar 29 2019,negative,forgettable at best annoying at worst the post credits scene outshines the whole movie
Mar 29 2019,negative,no story no villain no boss fight not my type watched it just because of whatever it had for endgame and the mid credits scenes was the only good thing about this movie nick fury loosing his eye was a joke lol
Mar 29 2019,negative,couldnt connect with carol at all its a shame they ruined this character
Mar 29 2019,positive,absolutely loved this movie from start to finish the relationship between brie larson and samuel l jackson drives this movie forward ben mendelsohn absolutely kills it as talos this is a great story and is a nice fit in the mcu this got me even more excited for avengers end game which i didnt think was possible this movie doesnt have some script issues at times but that is overshadowed by how much fun this movie is
Mar 29 2019,negative,movies should be made to portray a story however that must be done movies should be judged based on prior not on the impact it has on society movies now a day seem to be critiqued based off of the idea of them not the movie itself
Mar 29 2019,positive,a fun addition to the mcu captain marvel is a fun period piece with decent acting from brie larson a great performance from sam jackson and the way they play off of each other makes the movie work overall this isnt one of the best marvel movies but definitely not one of the worst or most forgettable either
Mar 29 2019,negative,watching all the black characters treat captain marvel with this level of reverence was borderline disturbing as an even further slap to the face not only did they make war hero and superspy nick fury into an utter buffoon but they rewrote the original source material for monica rambeau as not an equal of danvers but a subordinate who looks up to auntie carol ugh  that aside the story itself doesnt fit into the mcu as it creates numerous plot holes actually more like plot chasms removing that you still have a movie that suffers from delusions of adequacy the skrulls are wildly inconsistent with their behavior considering what their ultimate motivation is supposed to be the supposed  reveal just created an even bigger plot chasm without going too far into spoiler territory death orders were issued to relatively innocent parties and the supposed good guys in disguise engaged in reckless public endangerment that dare i say actually put them more in the role of villains than the movie implied 2nd worst mcu movie in my opinion
Mar 29 2019,positive,itâtms not the best movie in the mcu but itâtms no iron man iii either the story its biggest weakness was the thinness of characterization for the blueskinned kree starforce characters
Mar 29 2019,positive,amazing loved brie larson deserved to be an all time favourite thank god it has a stan lee cameo
Mar 29 2019,positive,my favorite marvel movie and i have seen them all the acting script and special effects were wonderful for the film cannot wait to see where this character leads us in endgame
Mar 29 2019,neutral,movie had its good moments but overall didnt leave that satisfyed especially with the final fight though the spaceships scene was cool there was no legit threat to add suspense as the movie reached it climax its an average marvel film with about a 2 or 3 time tops rewatchability for me which aint that great considering ive watched movies like iron man thor ragnorock doctor strange etc 5 6 7 times and enjoy
Mar 29 2019,neutral,it was quite mediocre it actually breaks continuity in some instances samuel jackson and ben mendelsohn were great brie larson was okay but she failed to make me feel invested in the character carol danvers was never in any kind of danger so i was never even remotely concerned for her they did nick fury dirty with the way they had him lose his eye before the movie came out i saw all these memes saying the cat did it but i didnt think it would actually happen considering how absurd it would be then i saw it happen and i just felt like i was trolled ronan was criminally underused in the film his only notable feat in the movie was fleeing from danvers who again was never in any danger i believe this film is at the same level of quality as thor the dark world and iron man 3 i expected better from marvel maybe theyll get it right by the time the inevitable sequel comes around
Mar 29 2019,positive,i loved this not great art but great fun
Mar 29 2019,neutral,just a normal superhero movie nothing too special 
Mar 29 2019,negative,captain marvel felt more like a necessary burden than an imaginative adventure i wanted to be transported to the marvel universe and explore the free skrill and go back to the 90s instead there was no adventure or exploration very little growth in any way from the characters and an anticlimactic finish the movie was decorated and technically executed like a 750 million movie but i felt now love or passion from it i didnt feel like it mattered to me or my sisters as we watched funny moments great effects and the cinematic universe buoyed this film
Mar 29 2019,positive,i though captain marvel was pretty good it feels like guardians of the galaxy mixed with thor
Mar 29 2019,positive,not perfect but makes a solid marvel movie the good thing about marvel is that everytime one of their movies comes out is not badits either fine or great or perfect
Mar 29 2019,negative,would give a higher score but the inadequate performance that brie larson gabe was just so terrible that i couldnï 12tmt enjoy the rest of the actors performances samuel l jackson gave another great performance but wasnï 12tmt enough to fix the lack of enthusiasm and emotion that brie larson gave
Mar 29 2019,negative,disappointed with the casting 
Mar 29 2019,positive,in a pivotal scene at the beginning of the third act and without giving any actual plot points away the soontobe captain marvel decides that for reasons that would give away the plot the color pattern of her suit needs to be redesigned more than just being a wonderful subversion of the classic costume change montage in so many chick flicks the short sequence signals the central ethos of the wider marvel universe the source of power comes from the heart not from the suit a character dons or the stones another collects the formula is by now familiar to the point of fatiguethe magic marvel formula never entirely belonged to that other captain who supposedly was the first avenger if not necessarily in namebut this iteration is filled with so much heart and so many clever character moments give me a buddy cop spinoff with just fury and the cat as to still be something special if not wholly singular
Mar 29 2019,positive,not a bad movie the story is a little flat but nick fury and the cat lighten things up a little
Mar 29 2019,positive,my review of captain marvel non spoiler    1 love goose the cat btw if you thought cats were scary when angry this movie gives you a reason to sleep with your eyes open if you own one    2 addressing one of the criticisms on this movie from some notable criticics yeah itâtms exactly what it is an âorigin storyâ thatâtms what we knew going into it and thats what youâtmre getting i really donâtmt know why thatâtms a shocker tm    3 as far as people saying the movie was âsexistâ or so some audience reviews have been calling it i didnâtmt really get that vibe despite being the main character captain marvel came off like black widow did in iron man 2 nick fury and the other male leads had plenty of screen time and jokes between both genders i would say were evenly distributed and not shaming of one another    4 as i said before captain marvel had a iron man 2 black widow vibe about her introduction plenty of badass moments you would expect from a hero of her caliber but if i could compare her to a male hero sheâtms like captain america with a side of iron man a strong witty and headstrong individual but a confident leader looking to find her place    5 i think most critics are missing the broader point despite this movie having a plot comparable to james cameronâtms avatar this movie seemed like a triumph of the will captain marvelâtms struggle to regain her past leaves her conflicted and in remembering her past looking back on all the times she had failed or fallen she continued to get up and push forward this same message of pushing through adversity doesnâtmt just apply to a single gender it should be a moral that everyone should be seeing and embrace no matter the difficulty you go through itâtms about how much you can take and keep moving forward     45 solid movie
Mar 29 2019,positive,larson shows off a very much needed human aspect to captain marvel this movie is a blast
Mar 29 2019,negative,graphics really good cast could work with awesome costumes but too many gaps in the story and pushy about political view and scrolls angle was boring and found the director and writers wrong for this movie another batman vs superman 
Mar 29 2019,negative,the jumpy editing the very bland middle 2 acts and the victimhood premise to try to inject struggle by making men look bad especially the motorcyclist being completely chauvinistic make the fair first act and decent final act seem too little to make the movie enjoyable in total
Mar 29 2019,positive,this was a really fun romp captain marvel seems too powerful so hope that she doesnt become a mary sue in her next outings
Mar 29 2019,negative,honestly after the first half of the movie i thought it was not too bad but it went down hill from there i have never seen a more anticlimactic movie ending i also did not like how they portrayed fury in my opinion his character had always been tough and mysterious and in this film he comes across as an absolute fool
Mar 29 2019,negative,i went into this movie wanting to give it  a chance regardless of the drama i heard about brie larsons opinion of certain people  i feel like brie was not the best choice to play cpt marvel like many have said before  i started checking the time to see how much was left of the movie at times  brie seemed very cold while delivering her lines and i found myself rolling my eyes at other times  if this wasnt connected to the mcu and a stand alone movie i would have just waited till it came out on dvd and rented it for 5  i felt like i was being preached to instead of just watching a superhero movie i dont want to feel guilty by the main character when seeing a marvel film  as i said before skip the movie and wait till its released on redbox netflix or whatever service you choose
Mar 29 2019,negative,the best thing and seemingly worst thing i can say about captain marvel is its a marvel movie its fornulaic like a recipe in a cookbook   first off the film really doesnt seem like necesary viewing for infinity warendgame it basically feels like filler meant to establish a character with alot of padding in between  so if thats what youre wondering there you go   the casting was alright though a bit underutilized only a couple of characters particularly stand out while the rest feel bland or wooden or are simply not given enough screentime to be used well the runors about the main character herself having only a few expressions do seemingly ring true here the villains for most of the film were seemingly inconsistent as well going back and forth between shooting at the main character beating her friend to a pulp in attempted murder and threatening a child to just being lovable goofballs all of a sudden it felt like someone in the writers room had two ideas ahead of time and instead of devoting to one they changed their mind a few times through the process   the music choices at most times felt shoehorned in not fitting scenes very well almost like they were just wanting to make a soundtrack of 90s nostalgia justbfor the sake of it i get the feeling those record sales will be decently high though   the effects were good at least on a base level the cgi was well done props and makeup were quite well conceived as well they werent really used to any great affect though most of the cgi heavy scenes sortof feeling like visual noise for lack of a better phrase   some people were worried about the political tones of the film while yes they are there and that may take away for some it will likely be enjoyable for others i dont feel like it takes to heavily away from the film though it does make her motivations feel a bit more murky in my opinion   the action was only really alright in one or two scenes for the most part it was pretty bland and boring alot of it was just pew pew lazers   all in all it was a film that you can get enjoyment out of especially if you love the marvel formula but it isnt anything spectacular really and honestly is gonna be pretty forgettable for most it feels like mcu filler shoved in last second to establish a new character
Mar 29 2019,negative,i had low expactations and walked out bored
Mar 29 2019,positive,it was decent i enjoyed the movie it had a good message and was decently executed special effects were very well done and the acting was on par i just wasnt blown away ill see it again maybe i missed a connection with it the first time 
Mar 29 2019,positive,i enjoyed this movie for the most part what really struck me was that this movie introduced the skrulls as sympathetic charactersit was odd take on the supervillain race samuel l jackson and goose stole the show in my opinion all this movie really was was an introduction to the guardians battle with ronan in vol 1 and the origin of the tesseract
Mar 29 2019,negative,trite and formulaic origin story not bad per se justmeh 
Mar 29 2019,positive,so fun jumping back into the 90s she rocked this role loved the credit scene too
Mar 29 2019,neutral,meh maybe tied with thor the dark world for the worst marvel movie
Mar 29 2019,positive,not the best of the marvel stories but did a good job tying up some loose ends in the overall marvel universe jackson and the cat were the stars of the movie
Mar 29 2019,negative,was disappoint with the lack of chemistry between characters  i feel that carol danvers had a better relationship with her best friends daughter then with her best friend  the cat was the best part of the movie this movie didnt feel like women power to me
Mar 29 2019,positive,saw it with my wife we both thought that the movie was good it wasnt the best mcu movie compared to the last superhero movie we saw which was aquaman we enjoyed captian marvel much more aquaman was an embarrassment of camp corn and cringe as a origin story cm was better than the first thor or hulk since larson signed a 7 movie deal we expect shell get better over the next decade well be seeing her in the roll
Mar 29 2019,negative,overall the movie was average but brie larsons acting dropped it to a three for me absolutely awful acting
Mar 29 2019,positive,first tings first before captain marvel there was milla jovovich with fifth element ultraviolet and resident evil   i watched captain marvel two times just to get the a bit different point of view and both times i failed to find many of the points that the film is criticised for i do not know about the politics that is going on in hollywood so my eyesight might be affected by the ignorance but i enjoyed the film thoroughly it shows a very well and realistically developed interpersonal relationships between two strangers in a crime that bonds over their shared experiences everyone who ever went to a place which was alien in both cultural and lingual aspects knows how easy and fast interpersonal relationships develop between two people who share some similarities and end up finding each other in such a strange environment i loved the friendship between the two air pilots i fail to see why anyone would complain about the lack of romantic relationship or would start to ship monica and carol as a couple reading some of the fanfantasies or criticism it seems that there are so many people who do not really know that there are many kinds of relationships and very often best friend relationship are more important takes longer to build and is harder to find that any romantic plot for the sake of having romance  overall i loved the dynamic of the characters i havent read any of the comics therefore they all seem consistent with the characterisation from other films ie fury coulson some complain about the acting of brie larson but i wonder if they ever complained about the acting of chris evans as captain america neither of these character require a lot of emotional acting however the scenes that does require it eg after carol learns her past mrs larson do deliver it i think her acting was spot on given the characters story and her character overall captain marvel is not a teenage spiderman she is an army officer and an ace her mindset how she carries herself are according to that plus she is lost in all possible aspects and on top of that must save entire species while fighting the only person she knew and trusted its an inner conflict and she doesnt go berserk by exposing it she internalise it the way any selfcontrolling person would do i will not say anything about the visual effects because everyone knows that marvel really takes the cherry in those  overall this film has a representation of a real interpersonal relationships therefore  nice character stories and something for the eyes as well thank you everyone who worked on it
Mar 29 2019,negative,been following the mcu for a while  this one is not good at all  makes me question if ill pay to go see end game
Mar 29 2019,positive,if you like marvel movies youll like this one the reverse is also true dont be put off by the social media nonsense leading up to the release date  the movie itself is blissfully free of politics its pure fun escapism if they hadnt had to release it in spring to make room for endgame this wouldve made a great summer blockbuster the family and i loved it
Mar 29 2019,negative,boring and predictable
Mar 29 2019,positive,she is great but the story is wambly
Mar 29 2019,negative,the worst marvel movie they could make best parts is nick fury
Mar 29 2019,negative,started out interesting then movie lost that steam and i lost consciousness
Mar 29 2019,negative,i went opening weekend  i should have waiting for it to be on netflix  as marvel movies go it was kind of lame   it was not the movie it had really been hyped up to be  want to have fun  instead see shazam
Mar 29 2019,negative,if i want to have a political agenda pushed down my throat ill watch mainstream media i dont need it in marvel movies
Mar 29 2019,negative,the movie was okay at best the writing wasnt great and most of the actors were great the visuals were stunning
Mar 29 2019,negative,this movie may be entertaining for some in the theater but this is by no means a good movie okay at best the main character is bland acting wise and the time given to develop the character were poor in execution which leads to a disengaged audience the worst part of the film is the ending as the climax does not feel tense with seemingly no challenges the space fight scene where she fights in her suit suit is boring as it lacks tension i think this was unfortunately a wasted opportunity of a film also nick fury feels out of character and is only played for laughs best of luck to endgame and captain marvel 2 to improving this character
Mar 29 2019,positive,it was ok people have been saying that larson needed to show more life in the role but i found her attempts to bring some spunk or humor to scenes to be blatantly forced and not natural for her she was at her best when she was single minded and focused on kicking ass the movie didnt seem to have a character arc a lot of things seemed forced in to make some tieins to the mcu at large
Mar 29 2019,negative,uhhh    how to put it it was boring i was amazed how i didnt care for almost anything in this movie    i mean i watched other marvel movies numerous times and they always entertain me even though i know everything about them    captain marvel i do not have desire to see 2nd time and i do not thin it will change the story and presentation was not on the level of other marvel movies    i hope cm improves in infinity wars
Mar 29 2019,negative,rotten tomatoes deleting user ratings the only ratings that matter
Mar 29 2019,neutral,mediocre not the standard for films by marvel at this point  bro larson is an amazing actor but i think sheï 12 12tms out of her depth playing this role  she seemed detached thoughout the film and itï 12 12tms quite obvious that samuel j was carrying her through this film 
Mar 29 2019,positive,i was very impressed the trailer looked confusing like it had no storyline but in the end everything gets summed up pretty well 
Mar 29 2019,positive,loved it so much i was worried with all the negative reviews but brie larson proved them wrong
Mar 29 2019,positive,this movie was fantastic full of great messages that support and empower women i thoroughly enjoyed the film and highly recommend it 
Mar 29 2019,positive,a few good moments of dialogue filing cabinet venus fly trap with a great cat and furys back story with his eye i wont be purchasing the movie when its out on dvd and really have no desire to see it again 
Mar 29 2019,negative,one time watch only when you are free  
Mar 29 2019,positive,i love captain marvel its so cool with her super powers
Mar 29 2019,negative,boring choppy story wise cat was cool but brie has a total of 3 facial expressions so weak movie was watchable but i dont think i will see it again in my lifetime
Mar 29 2019,positive,great movie dont understand all of the hate
Mar 29 2019,negative,this would be a passable movie on entertainment value alone unfortunately it also does damage to the established lore of the mcu
Mar 29 2019,positive,so much unfair hate for this movie  this movie was entertaining dont listen to the haters youll enjoy this movie 
Mar 29 2019,neutral,not what i expected
Mar 29 2019,negative,just an absolutely horrific movie this ruined my week my disappointment is immeasurable livid
Mar 29 2019,negative,along with thor the dark world the worst marvel movie in the entire mcu its hard to find anything positive to say just thoroughly meh hoping the character is redeemed by avengers endgame
Mar 29 2019,positive,decent movie with good points and bad points  just wasnt anything special
Mar 29 2019,positive,great addition to the marvel cinematic universe
Mar 29 2019,negative,boring thank goodness for nick fury  the only character with a personality  i am less excited to see endgame now that captain marvel has answered the page the movie did nothing to build the anticipation for endgame and answered no real questions no emotional connection was made with the title character her origin story is incredibly weak why should we care about captain marvel i really dont know 
Mar 29 2019,positive,absolutely loved it
Mar 29 2019,negative,a dredful display of ideology versus storytelling
Mar 29 2019,negative,so disappointing dull and uninspired moviemaking about a character with no personality played by an actress with no charisma
Mar 28 2019,negative,ive been following the mcu for a while now even before it was popular i just hope this isnt a sign of things to come this is one of the worst movies ive seen from marveldisney in a long time with lady characters like black widow and scarlett witch to choose from why they went with this unpopular character from the marvel universe is beyond me this movie was boring wow brie was dull and showed no emotion in her acting the story in this movie dragged and felt rushed what a shame and a missed opportunity of disneymarvel to give us this waste of a movie a month before the finale of this epic movie journey weve been on for a decade and to think captain marvel is the future of this franchise is not good for movie fans comic book industry or toy retailers a real missed opportunity if captain marvel is the one that defeats thanos ill be done with the mcu
Mar 28 2019,negative,total garbagedont see it
Mar 28 2019,positive,movie is good and brie is perfect for that role and the movie also has an amazing story
Mar 28 2019,negative,not on par with all the other marvel movies
Mar 28 2019,positive,pleasantly surprised expected this is be guff 
Mar 28 2019,positive,very good acting and animations 
Mar 28 2019,positive,i liked it i thought the story was solid enjoyed the 90s nostalgia overall i liked this film
Mar 28 2019,negative,not purely terrible but writing was poor throughout and acting particularly of captain marvel and captain marvell was lackluster at best the biggest problem however was that there was never any danger or any stakes to the events in the movie
Mar 28 2019,negative,i did not enjoy it its was kind of blah nothing new here no tension just blast blast blast  you know already that she is going to be fine as the next film is endgame
Mar 28 2019,positive,one of the film of 2019 so far really like it 
Mar 28 2019,negative,im a huge marvel fan its a movie i look forward to watch each time a new one is out however this was was the worst marvel movie i have seen so far there is nothing there that makes me relate with the characters or the story the actress was also not a good pick for the characters she was trying to project total failure in my book i wont watch the next one is there story quality is just as bad
Mar 28 2019,negative,an average story with bland characters there is no powerful villain which  makes it really worse fury and coulson characters are the ones which makes it bearble for a few minutes
Mar 28 2019,negative,captain marvel acting is the same as twilight with no expression boring
Mar 28 2019,positive,a serviceable super hero movie pretty generic but still entertaining
Mar 28 2019,positive,the beginning was a little confusing but as the story progressed the reasons became clear now i want to see it again knowing the story an excellent addition to the mcu
Mar 28 2019,positive,it was a good movie but had a slow start to the movie as well as some jokes that didnt land
Mar 28 2019,negative,oh my i have been wanting a captain marvel movie for the longest time unlike others i had no problem with a woman playing the lead role women are tough too if you dont believe me you need to meet my mom anyway super stoked the trailers were making want to see it even more finally got my chance and man it just fell flat at my feet brie larson didnt look like she was trying her character had no character the plot was generic and followed the same ole tropes perfectly the special effects are pretty amazing though visually the movie was stunning altogether this movie didnt come close to the hype and i walked away feeling like a kid that just got broken up with by his first true love sorry folks this is not a good movie
Mar 28 2019,neutral,boring lacks character development 
Mar 28 2019,negative,wow i didnt think one of the most unpopular charactors in comics could become more unlikeable on the big screen but marvel does it again
Mar 28 2019,negative,stay home and watch something else boring
Mar 28 2019,positive,samuel l jackson makes the movie didnt care for the no doubt song placement  took the possibility of her losing the fight away wish the part where she destroy one ship and it kills the rest was a bit more to it
Mar 28 2019,positive,the movie was not bad it was about on par with iron man 3 the action was fine but the plot involving the kree felt rushed  they could have done a better job integrating the kree into the story line as if you did not see guardians of the galaxy you wouldnt even have been aware of who they were
Mar 28 2019,positive,great movie good backstory and it moves quick enough to keep you interested in it all the way through fun and makes sense in the entire story line captain marvel2 gives us a lot to build on
Mar 28 2019,negative,boring and uneventful cast was ok but director team and writers need to be replaced moving forward
Mar 28 2019,positive,great movie dont listen to the haters
Mar 28 2019,positive,was really boring until the very end
Mar 28 2019,neutral,not bad but far from perfect  some narrative choices are questionable and certain music choices are jarring and out of place
Mar 28 2019,positive,we enjoyed the movie its a good story but not complete theres a promise of more to come theres a bonus if you really know marvel comics you will see a rich selection of easter eggs in this film id like to see more of captain marvel and more marvel stories in general
Mar 28 2019,positive,this movie was amazing up there with guardians black panther and thor ragnarok unfortunately the marvel fandom has a lot of neck beards who are scraping for any reason to hate this but it was so inspiring to me and the guy i saw it with it was entertaining had good comedy and made good references to other marvel movies it was cool as a female veteran to finally see someone i really relate to but once again my other favorite marvel movies all have male leads i think you can be inspired by this movie regardless of your gender so excited to see how captain marvel fits into endgame
Mar 28 2019,positive,i loved it saw it in 3d and it was a joy to watch
Mar 28 2019,positive,great movie it was chocked full of 90âtms nostalgia from my childhood brie larson was an awesome choice for carol danvers once again marvel studios found a way to balance everything perfectly in a newish genre no doubtâtms just a girl for the bg music in the final fight brought back memories of when i was a teen and finding my kind of music for the first time
Mar 28 2019,negative,my girlfriend and i saw captain marvel on opening day normally by the end of the movie you are rooting for the heroheroine neither my girlfriend or i felt a connection with cm my girlfriend keep checking her watch if cm would have died at the end of the movie i just would not have cared enough it was a good one watch movie
Mar 28 2019,negative,if you say this is a 55 you are just lying its not a 05 but its nowhere near a 55 unless you are defending this movie for reasons other than its merit the acting and writing of brie was just flat out bad and boring shes better in other movies but having her as a hero is just bad the writing is probably just as much to blame as her acting the only redeeming factor was a few side actors that did well and the effects were good other than that a whole lot of forgettable nothing happening i tried watching this twice just to give it a fair review i honestly couldnt keep focused its just too boring
Mar 28 2019,negative,unimaginitive  basically marvels remake of ryan reynolds green lantern  relies too much on nostalgia and effects are obviously low budget relative to other marvel films  you can safely skip this one
Mar 28 2019,negative,just never caught its stride never got a vibe or a feeling the comedy never worked i never knew her personality they just told me what she was supposed to be instead of showing who she was and then she wasnt even what they said she ewould be just didnt work they seemed to be doing a reverse origin story where we jump into her story and she spends the rest of teh time figuring out who she was  also brie larson just dient seem like a natural super hero kind of forced
Mar 28 2019,positive,despite the other ratings we really like it  fun action packed  humor and enough plot twists to keep it interesting to the end i may see it again
Mar 28 2019,positive,great movie another hit for marvel and it was almost as good as wonder woman the best hero film of all time
Mar 28 2019,negative,boring as hell movie protag bland jokes unfunny plot confusing
Mar 28 2019,positive,captain marvel is an exciting new addition to the mcu
Mar 28 2019,positive,loved this movie it is nice to see a female superhero take center stage in a marvel movie
Mar 28 2019,negative,i like the marvel universe i also like miss marvel i did not like captain marvel the movie progresses with very little life and energy not helped by brie larson and her drab performance not terrible but not exciting i just wish that she can improve in the future as the present does not instill much excitement
Mar 28 2019,positive,great movie i always love these
Mar 28 2019,negative,just meh  didnt find a reason to care good action at the end
Mar 28 2019,positive,really enjoyed the movie
Mar 28 2019,negative,captain marvel as a superhero is not a very appealing character  its not the fault of brie larson its the fault of the story
Mar 28 2019,negative,this movie had so many plot holes it hurt marvel universe itself watch it only if you are go girl go kind of person else only go if you went outside and nothing else to do
Mar 28 2019,neutral,entertaining as a cartoon on saturday morning  simple themes and unmemorable characters but the central figure has gravity i appreciated it as a movie that as part of the franchise of marvel did its due diligence in the realms of culture reference and snarky remarks as well as well times heart felt drama wells but it had zero original elements beside making personal force fields a little sexier
Mar 28 2019,neutral,i finally saw it  they should have titled it captain mehvel
Mar 28 2019,negative,terrible movie boring leonard part 6 was better
Mar 28 2019,positive,awesome movie with a very interesting origin story
Mar 28 2019,negative,very let down visually it wasnt blowing away any of the other movies in the marvel franchise the plot didnt make a lot of sense and didnt seem to have a revealclimax the acting is great but not really what you see a marvel movie for honestly feel like i shouldve waited for the next avengers movie
Mar 28 2019,positive,captain marvels first half is a bit of a struggle and the poacing feels offwhile admittedly captain marvels second half is stronger than the first in the end it left me wanting more things are wrapped up nicely and some fun easter eggs are thrown in throughout i feel like the film could have used stronger action sequences for someone being touted as marvels strongest superhero i would have liked to see more ass whopping and longer action sequences when she finally embraces her power it is fun to watch and would have been nice to see more of that brie larson provides an excellent performance and it is fun to watch a hero have fast quips which feel genuine and not forced in the end id give captain marvel a 75
Mar 28 2019,positive,worth watching i saw in theatres twice brie larson is great is great plays the over confident strong willed getting into trouble because of it like a badass ben mendelssohn has some of the funniest lines great actor awesome fight scenes cgi looking forward to her in endgame one of the best mcu origin stories behind iron man and captain america
Mar 28 2019,negative,not the worst and certainly not the best i pay hard earned money to see these movies and to be entertained but now its all about propaganda endgame and iï 12 12tmm done of watching marveldisney movies
Mar 28 2019,negative,the special effects were alright but the entire movie felt like it didnâtmt really add up to anything at all on the bright side i donâtmt think captain marvel will be as integral to endgameâtms story other than taking over the mcu in the end itâtms been a fun 14 years but if endgame doesnâtmt impress then this was a terrible way to cap it off or start off the next saga depending on your point of reference
Mar 28 2019,positive,a film that sorely deserves more positive attention ignore the useless controversies this is an entertaining film designed to tide the fans over until end game
Mar 28 2019,negative,a bland movie about one of the least liked marvel superheroes in comics
Mar 28 2019,negative,took me 3 weeks to post  this isnt a suspicion anymore    i didnt enjoy bries performance at all bland and charmless the humour was off not entirely sure thats her fault and not the directorscriptwriters mind you even a more personable actor mightnt have saved the day as marvel have decided to import the biggest headache of the dc universe namely that the lead character is invincible sure superman can be taken down with kyptonite but failing that its all preordained well of course we usually know whos going to survive any film but in theory they could die and they all have faults that make them endearing or relatable not so with carol danvers im genuinely worried for endgame now thanos no problem lets call captain marvel and really concerned about the mcu after than if captain marvel is going to be the anchor still weve had a good run i suppose    and yes if you give this movie 5 stars youre full of it
Mar 28 2019,positive,fills in alot of info not the most exciting but a great origin story 
Mar 28 2019,positive,movie had a terrific storyline and characters that i believe people of all ages will enjoy
Mar 28 2019,negative,just a bad movie  i was bored
Mar 28 2019,positive,one of the best mcu movies
Mar 28 2019,positive,honestly not sure why so many people are hating on captain marvel it was a great origin story we see our heroine discover who she truly is find her own path and set up the avengers as we now know them in the mcu the movie is funny with a great buddy relationship between carol and fury and as a child of the 90s the nostalgia game was on point was it the most mindblowing marvel movie no but it doesnt have to be like the first captain america movie it is introducing us to characters we will come to know and love in future movies i will never tire of seeing a strong woman kicking ass go with an open mind and enjoy
Mar 28 2019,negative,no graphic no plot   no actors
Mar 28 2019,positive,incredible movie went to see this movie with my family this movie is definitely one of my top favorite marvel movies and a generally greta movie overall even with a heavily cgid cat as a guy im happy to see women finally taking the lead in movies like this and proving women can do anything men can and more 5 stars
Mar 28 2019,negative,the worst marvel movie ever made
Mar 28 2019,negative,talk about super hero fatigue these movies becoming so cartoonish and boring
Mar 28 2019,positive,love love captain marvel  yesterday my cousin gived me a kitten and his name is maverick from top gun
Mar 28 2019,positive,i really enjoyed this movie and made me more excited for avengers endgame
Mar 28 2019,positive,captain marvel has been getting a bad rap the movie is enjoyable it probably isnt going to win any awards but for the audience there are plenty of moments that keep the movie enjoyable
Mar 28 2019,negative,from the villains to the hero nothing was enjoyable i didnt have high hopes because the comics for captain marvel arent good at all
Mar 28 2019,negative,this is better than thor the dark world but worse than iron man 3 i ignore hype and just watch the movies to be entertained i go for a break from politics and stress this movie didnt have an overly political tone or even come across as feminist which made me happy but it was just bland compared to the rest of the marvel cinematic universe
Mar 28 2019,negative,not a movie i want to watch the only reason this movie is making it big at box students are being forced to watch it my children had the option of going to the movies to watch this or get punished and stay at school with tuns of written assignments 
Mar 28 2019,positive,there were some gaps in the story but i enjoyed the back story with fury  if nothing else see it for goose  larson does a great job and i love the vibe she brought to the character
Mar 28 2019,negative,i would have rather watched wonder woman a 5th time than this movie
Mar 28 2019,negative,the movi at best is mediocer  but moore then that the only thing witch are nice are kree
Mar 28 2019,negative,im all for diversity and woman power as long as a good story is highest priority but since the last jedi holly does not care about story this movie is forgettable and will have little replay value for future generations escapism is a lost form
Mar 28 2019,neutral,this is a decent movie not great but good a little stiff and leans on sam l a little much ms larsons talent is obvious but the movie does not use her strengths enough  when they try to make her funny it just doesnt work in a sequal they should just let her be the straight man and let the comedy come from her reacting to the crazy that is being a superhero
Mar 28 2019,negative,its almost like marvel doesnt know its own lore behind what movies have already been made they create timeline issues with this film larson looks like she doesnt even want to be there and is way to good for this film
Mar 28 2019,negative,terrible movie and would not recommend the only thing that marvel had to fight was the rest of the cast for our acting her the entire time
Mar 28 2019,negative,you can skip this movie just saw this since i felt i needed to before endgame yea you dont need to i thought i wouldnt believe what people were saying and went to see it big waste of money
Mar 28 2019,positive,captain marvel was a fun experience is it the best movie to come out of the mcu i do not think so but i really enjoyed it it had some laughs the buddy vibe between nick fury and captain marvel was great solid movie would recommend
Mar 28 2019,negative,kind of meh disappointed at the movie main character just not very interesting i didnt feel much tension  and it was a little too preachy for me i hope she doesnt do much in endgame
Mar 28 2019,positive,while i didnt love captain marvel as a character the supporting cast and villain were great the visuals were nothing extraordinary but still pretty  overall this movies feels like its from phase 1 of the mcu it suffers many of the same problems but its simple tone allows for a fun watch   i cant tell if i didt like captain marvel because of brie larsons performance or the bad writing however i am excited to see where the character is taken in future mcu installments
Mar 28 2019,negative,batman v superman is better and i hate batman v superman
Mar 28 2019,positive,one of the best of the marvel franchise
Mar 28 2019,negative,i saw captain marvel and would say it was a waste of money and should of waited for release on vhs
Mar 28 2019,negative,i thought it wouldï 12tmve been better kind of let down leaving theater
Mar 28 2019,negative,far from being a memorable movie or even on the levels of wonder woman a very underwhelming performance by brie larson wanted this so bad to be a success but was left disappointed by the results
Mar 28 2019,negative,this movie was okay it certainly isnt what i was expecting as a 40 year collector of comics i know this character very well especially the years where rogue stole her powers and she became binary this is not the character i know from the comics and what they did to furys eye unforgivable ugh terrible
Mar 28 2019,negative,found it quite unoriginal and boring worth a watch for the back story though
Mar 28 2019,negative,had been looking forward to this movie since i first heard about the film being in development      unfortunately the lead had no emotional range so sapped the energy from all character interactions was so powerful her presence sapped the energy  and any tension from the action scenes as there was really never any threat to her    and rip nick furys integrity turns out he lost an eye cause he liked cats too much    as for plot there was really no reason to shoehorn marvel  into the franchise with so many clumsy retcons    i really want her to succeed so hopefully theyll score some more adept writersdirectors for her next sequel
Mar 28 2019,negative,as a woman for whom this movie was apparently made for to say i didnt like it is an understatement there was nothing likable about brie larsons portrayal of carol i dont associate myself with women who act like that in real life why would i want to spend money to watch it in super hero movie which is supposed to be fun they emasculated fury to prop her up and made monica rambeau a child who looks up to aunt carol  if disney wanted to truly wanted to have a woman as the forefront of the mcu utilize monica rambeau as she once led the avengers in the comics and was captain marvel way before cd    overall the movie was boring the character was unlikable and the supporting characters were there to simply prop her up and tell her how awesome she is and to change the origin of how fury lost his eye and how he came up with the name avengers was ridiculous i will never watch this movie again and worry for the future of the mcu for the first time in 10 years
Mar 28 2019,positive,the main purpose to watch this is to prepare myself for the upcoming avengers 4 the story of captain marvel is really far behind wonder woman 2 years ago
Mar 28 2019,negative,as far as the mcu goes this was disappointing
Mar 28 2019,positive,this movie is osm i love captain marvel and this movie
Mar 28 2019,positive,wanted to hate it but it was ok just ok
Mar 28 2019,positive,i went in with low expectations but was pleasantly surprised some good connections to the next avengers movie
Mar 28 2019,positive,captain marvel is not perfect but the message is clear
Mar 28 2019,neutral,i expected so much more i was really let down by the lack of character depth with carol captain marvel deserves a much better movie than this
Mar 28 2019,positive,a smart and charming smashhit that drives home to our kids the modern image of a female hero in her best form yet
Mar 28 2019,positive,it was an enjoyable movie with nice story and really good action its a nice addition to the mcu and makes you to anticipate more for the endgame
Mar 28 2019,positive,amazing character and love the story
Mar 28 2019,neutral,captain marvel is the latest mcu movie leading up to avengers end game and well it doesnt get me excited going into the movie i was worried about the politics that was involved with the movie but happily it wasnt as bad as i thought now the biggest  problem with the movie was captain marvel herself she just seemed dull as a character not that relateable at all and her most down moment in her film was believing in a lie she was above her enimes by far making it look like a one sided fight everytime i didnt fear for anyones life cause well its a by the numbers marvel movie origin wise i knew everyone would be fine by the end they also didnt need to add where the avengers got there name it just wasnt needed my last fault with the film is when she got her full powers i wasnt excited cause all the fights were poor in all honesty and always one sided i did like the cgi that was pretty on point ioved the supporting cast especially nick fury and the cat but the emotion came from the skrulls and maria rambeua i really enjoyed all the supporting cast and comedy at the end of the day i think captain marvel is boreing and a step back from current mcu titles i hope cm gets more development that is needed for the character in end game but thats my opinion
Mar 28 2019,positive,carol danvers aka captain marvel is a formidable force and a welcome addition to the mcu
Mar 28 2019,positive,good but found myself lost at times in the storyline
Mar 28 2019,positive,another fun and highly entertaining chapter in the marvel universe
Mar 28 2019,negative,the good thing is you dont actually need to watch this film during your mcu marathon it doesnt add or take away anything so just pretend it doesnt exist and carry on
Mar 28 2019,positive,i really dont understand the negativity this film is garnering it doesnt shove feminism down your throat its not the best marvel superhero movie but its still good 
Mar 28 2019,positive,one of the best movies of the mcu very good actors amazing soundtrack and incredible plot
Mar 28 2019,positive,nice movie brie is capable of delivering what a female superhero should be must see if you looking for the endgame
Mar 28 2019,positive,entertaining and fun sure bree larson isnt the most charismatic of super heros but shes believable in the role and did well im excited to see what comes next i frankly dont understand the hate or i guess i do understand the hate but just think people need to get over the fact that women are allowed to have opinions even ones that they themselves dont agree with my one quibble is that captain marvel is a bit of a mary sue i would have liked to have seen her have to learn how to use her powers instead of having them come so easily but thats a common flaw in films like this they only have so much time to tell a story
Mar 28 2019,negative,super boring terrible acting on bries part and the story was really lackluster id rank this honestly as one of the worst marvel movies to date 
Mar 28 2019,positive,loved and go air force
Mar 28 2019,positive,where there some predictable moments just like all of the other super hero movies yes but they were fun it felt good to root for comic book characters again
Mar 28 2019,neutral,not a troll or a manbaby the movie is just boring and badly made
Mar 28 2019,positive,great fun love goose
Mar 28 2019,positive,not bad  great that they had a small tribute to stan lee at the stan of the film rip stan thanks for everything
Mar 27 2019,positive,this was awesome great introduction to captain marvel now we just need a movie of a backstory of the krees 
Mar 27 2019,negative,ive been a big fan of marvel this movie wasnt up to par with the other movies acting was average storyline was soso really just an average movie wait for it to come out on dvd
Mar 27 2019,positive,a stellar if small 90s soundtrack a funny charismatic lead charming supporting characters incredible villain dynamic and an overall empowering fun time for people of all kinds make this one of the best solo origin films the mcu has offered to date while not doing much to shake up the mcu origin formula itself the rearranging of the timeline does enough to keep the reveals coming at a steady and intriguing pace the movie starts off slow and trudges along on exposition and does not do much to get us interested or empathizing with the characters yet and then the movie takes a turn as soon as the films plot finds its way to earth the story characters and overall value skyrocket it becomes much funnier much more exciting and wholly entertaining as the film plays out when i got to the exciting fistpumpingly fun finale i felt empowered and excited and the empowering tone and message of this film has in fact nothing to do with gender sex race or anything like that instead the empowerment comes from a place of self determination self respect and internal conflicts which anybody could be able to empathize with overall this film is an exciting new entry to the mcu and as the penultimate entry before the gamechanging final chapter to this 11 year long arc avengers endgame it gives us a moment to breath after infinity war and an exciting new cast story thread to consider as we look to the ending once more
Mar 27 2019,negative,personally i feel the cast choice was soo wrong but the script didnt help much as well though on the whole i wouldnt say it was a baaad movie but still i expect marvel to be on the better side
Mar 27 2019,positive,movie was ok not great but not bad either i hope captain marvel starts acting more human than alien in the future at this time i attribute her lack of emotion through most of he movie to playing the part of a brain wiped human transformed into a soldier with emotions held in check i guess none of the other times that earth was near annihilation was important enough to call for captain marvel until infinity war was already over we will see if she is a team player or not it seems her role in end game is being held secret as previews dont show her presence except for a very brief moment with thor 
Mar 27 2019,negative,2 hours of dialogue and 5mins of action 15 different occasions where the main character is told to stop being so emotional literally only acts on emotions the entire movie
Mar 27 2019,positive,honestly it is not a wonderful movie but i liked a lot is funny whith great special effects i would like to see it again
Mar 27 2019,positive,fantastic movie one of the best mcu movies to date brie larson did a  phenomenal job portraying captain marvel and i canï 12tmt wait to see her again in end game and future movies
Mar 27 2019,negative,very disappointed with this movie it was committed with action sequences but the story and plot was something to laugh at it was a drag to sit and watch through
Mar 27 2019,positive,great story line strong comic book feel  looking forward to the sequel 
Mar 27 2019,positive,liked it   i wasnt sure if i would like the new character of the avengers but she was awesome
Mar 27 2019,negative,goose the cat and nick furry are perhaps the only best parts of the movie rest of it feels boring
Mar 27 2019,negative,the movie is very medioce this movie is supposed to introduce the most powerful heroine of the mcu but nothing is shown but a movie with a lack of imagination the revelation of the true antagonist leaves much to be desired action scenes are not the best of the mcu funny scenes are only used to keep the viewer awake
Mar 27 2019,positive,this was an good movie
Mar 27 2019,positive,thouroughly enjoyed the movie brie larsen nailed it 
Mar 27 2019,negative,it was a boring snooze fest predictable from one second to the next i didnt fall asleep during the movie i tried to sleep this my last special effects devoid of a storyline stupid waste of time moving try developing the characters a little next time instead of dumbass special effects marvel will not make him a nickel off me if their movies are like this 
Mar 27 2019,positive,i dont really get all the hate this movie is getting i really enjoyed it
Mar 27 2019,neutral,not sure im allowed to review as im a white man but it was okay besides the sometimes nauseatingly ham fisted attempts to portray the female characters as strong in spite of all the men around them pushing them down and telling them they arent good enough and that women arent cut out to be pilots even though the only two named pilots are women and the woman in charge of the super secret flight project is a woman and pointing out that they dont need men every few minutes just in case you forgot it wasnt the worst marvel movie but then there are like 22 at this point so that isnt exactly high praise i just feel like it was way too focussed on the feminist message rather than just getting on with it and making a good movie which this easily could have been
Mar 27 2019,positive,captain marvel is entertaining and wellacted but suffers from being predicable and as part of a larger cinematic universe lacks the strength of a standalone movies
Mar 27 2019,positive,the movie was just amazing an excelent performance brie larson is just excelent as captain marvel the script is well executed almost perfect
Mar 27 2019,positive,thoroughly enjoyable film with    a simple narrative that allows marvel and nick fury to shine some laugh out loud moments dont forget to stay for two post credit scenes that set the scene for future films
Mar 27 2019,positive,absolutely fantasic i loved it so much brie did an excellent job its my favorite marvel movie hell i think its my favorite movie of all time
Mar 27 2019,positive,another great chapter for the mcu
Mar 27 2019,negative,terrible movie nick fury the greatest spy in the world or as tony stark would put it he is the spy and in captain marvel he looks no better than a mall cop nick trusted captain marvel based on so little information that he knew about her and as we know from winter solider nick as trust issues in winter solider nick says last time i trusted someone i lost an eye now we learn that he lost his eye because goose a cat in the movie scratched it that degrades nick fury as a character it makes him not the bad ass that he is whoever said that nick fury is going to lose his eye because of goose should be fired in the winter solider alexander perice says he first met nick while he was stationed in bogota which is in south america not america where captain marvel is placed he could have moved but i think it just confuses the timeline in the first avengers nick fury said that shield started making nukes and other weapons from the tesseract because shield learned from thor that aliens are real and they were out gunned by the aliens in captain marvel shield finds out aliens are real and that the aliens out gun them just as nick said so why did it take decades for shield to learn they should prepare for an alien invasion i dont see why nick would keep captain marvel a secret if the avengers ever met her they would need to know that see is a friendly and not mistake her for an enemy in the movie their is this engineer working on a lightspeed plane to do this she uses the tesseract to help her then keeps the tesseract in a spaceship orbiting earth even after she dies its still in the ship so how the hell did an engineer get the tesseract and why did no one look for it after she died howard stark traced the tesseracts energy signature in captain america the first avenger so how come no one else thought of this i am not going to talk about the plot as that would take forever captain marvel is basically undefeatable and this ruins the movie to prove i am not sexist like the news may call me i have the same problem thor and i also dont like how captain america my favorite hero was able to take a punch from thanos 
Mar 27 2019,positive,this is a solid marvel movie nothing spectacular here but a nice part of the marvel universe
Mar 27 2019,negative,it was an okay movie it didnt hace the charm that a lot of other marvel movies have the humor felt forced and fell flat i didnt care much for brie larsons portrayal of carol danvers she was kind of dull and tried too hard to act like a modern day feminist supporting cast was very weak all in all it was an alright movie but ranks pretty low compared to other marvel films
Mar 27 2019,negative,worst movie of marvel
Mar 27 2019,negative,it was below average as a movie and one of the worst from the mcu    carol danvers forced lame flashbacks were cringeworthy and stuff that i doubt happens outside of the 1950s
Mar 27 2019,positive,it was pretty good it doesnt exactly match up with the comics but thats okay the mcu hasnt really been following them at all but as a movie on its own id give it my 4 stars
Mar 27 2019,positive,we really liked this movie and found it to be funny and a female positive spin for the marvel universe
Mar 27 2019,positive,as a chick from the 80s90s i loved the chick rock music that backed up the movie maybe this is more of a kick ass chick movie since she is in fact a chick sorry dudes  and theres nothing wrong with that  my mom went to see it twice and so will i
Mar 27 2019,negative,it wasnt awful it just wasnt good at all  every actor except brie in my opinion really really phoned it in on this one i havent seen sam jackson put up a performance like that since snakes on a plane seriously  storyline was just a total lazy mess   the first like two 90s references were cute but then they keep ramming a 90s cliche down your throat like every freaking 5 minutes we get the point  you literally couldve stopped at the blockbuster  they totally twisted up the canon story which dont get me wrong im totally cool withbut only if it serves any damn purpose at all which it does not  honestly theres a ton of stuff i just didnt care for but the real issue was that this movie  that shouldve been awesome  was just completely dull and underwhelming   i feel bad for brie larson for getting written into such an obviously forced and terribly lazy script  and really thats all  it just wasnt good
Mar 27 2019,negative,cant give away spoilers so i cant tell you exactly where the movie was predictable but it was predictable  and there were small plot holes that constantly took me out of the moviegoing experience  characters from another planet who had just landed on earth that day were making quips regarding earths pop culture  umhow would they be able to do that  and forgive me but captain marvels power were just too much literally  too much power  she can do anythingso where is the tension
Mar 27 2019,positive,i didnt like it as much as black panther or thor ragnarok but it wasnt as bad as thor the dark world or the incredible hulk either perfectly enjoyable and a fine entry into the mcu
Mar 27 2019,positive,while some of teh special effects are weak the movie lives up to the marvel legacy for humor and story  and the action is great
Mar 27 2019,negative,poor direction poor acting it felt like they were in a rush to direct this movie the origin stories in the marvel universe have been fantastic up until this point it was very forgettable movie experience the only reason i survived this movie is because captain marvel has a role to play in avengers endgame not worth it
Mar 27 2019,positive,it was fun but no wonder women still definitely worth going to the theater to see it i am really in to the marvel universe and if you are like me you will have a good time it is not their best though
Mar 27 2019,neutral,not on par with the other marvel movies 
Mar 27 2019,positive,it was kind of funny but it wasnt as action packed as the other marvels movies
Mar 27 2019,positive,it was exactly how i expected it to be just an overall sweet and enjoyable ride it was basically marvel refurbishing their whole marvel cinematic universe before their big finale endgame the movie had elements not only from the avengers but also the guardians of the galaxy and even agents of shield not to mention the role it played for young girls on womens international day and the simple yet empowering messages it sent by its simple and not unnecessarily complicated plot such as promoting inclusivity and unbiased judgement it really was the perfect movie for that really bad time slot between infinity war and end game i really appreciated it and brie larson did a charming job
Mar 27 2019,positive,i liken this movie to the first thor its a spectacle its fun the humor is typical marvel style the characters are all fine its worth going to the theater and seeing it doesnt break ground though nothing really innovative or fresh they could have played up the 90s theme better maybe like really went retro
Mar 27 2019,negative,this was a visually pleasing movie but thats about it the one thing that kept kicking at me was the fact that fury after being a major in the army and after being in shield for a while seemed very passive and easily dismissed by almost every character in the movie it was horrible to see that character mentally and emotionally hobbled in that manner treating him like some green recruit
Mar 27 2019,positive,great mix of mcus signature action drama and humor with appropriate political undertones
Mar 27 2019,negative,there were some good moments and characters i really enjoyed nick fury and the skrulls but ultimately brie larsons performance was a perfect metaphor for the overarching problem  of the show    tries too hard and comes up flat and generally just cringey     just about every other marvel movie was better
Mar 27 2019,negative,never comment on any movie until now this movie is so bad is not even funny
Mar 27 2019,positive,captain marvel 2019 is the perfect example of how not to subvert expectations where captain marvelâ  thrives is also where it sufferers captain marvel is a lighthearted movie filled with witty one liners and funny gags some of which work perfectly some of which dont work at allâ most of the humour comes from the conversations between carol danvers and nick fury and for the most part they are great especially their initial confrontation however many of the jokes come off as cheap and forced
Mar 27 2019,negative,a predictable movie
Mar 27 2019,positive,inspiring strong fun movie special effects on perform well liked the movie advise
Mar 27 2019,positive,loved everything about this onegreat script acting action and marvel universe backstory
Mar 27 2019,positive,captain marvel is one of the best marvel movies in the mcu film franchise i thoroughly enjoyed every moment of it it was funny charming witty dramatic and actionpacked the cgi and visual effects were top notch as well it is also an excellent film for girls and women to watch because it proves that women are unstoppable and cant be broken captain marvel for president 
Mar 27 2019,positive,ironically captain marvel is smaller in story like the movie antman even though its galactic in scaleexpects to audience to be told the character is super strong rather than show through development  doesnt do much to distinguish it from the other marvel movies story wise
Mar 27 2019,neutral,this movie had some positive moments but overall though captain marvel is now the strongest marvel character the character itself from a writing prospective is the weakest she did nothing to become as powerful as she is and she is so insanely powerful nothing in this movie was a real challenge for her heroes need weaknesses struggles and flaws thats what makes them human captain marvel doesnt and is this an unrelatable character brie larsons acting is also below average for such a big budget film though i will admit she does have a few good moments 
Mar 27 2019,positive,32 stars could of been better
Mar 27 2019,negative,save yourself the money its not worth the watch
Mar 27 2019,positive,bring me thanos fresh tomato
Mar 27 2019,positive,one unexpected movie a must see a
Mar 27 2019,positive,the movie was fantastic cant wait for end game
Mar 27 2019,positive,really enjoyed it always loved this marvel character and this adaptation had just the right balance of kickass action humor and emotion and helps tie more story lines together breathtaking visuals as well loved larsons understated hip downtoearth marvel which is an accomplishment considering her character is about as badass as they get in the marvel universe
Mar 27 2019,positive,again   this is digital video with no illusion of motion great edtitng brie larson is excellent and carries the whole thing outside of too much exposition in the opening there sre about 30 intriguing minutes in this piece until it turns to mainly marvel schick faster and cheaper does not mean better  martin scorsese
Mar 27 2019,positive,was an absolute thrill ride i loved every second of brie larson in action samuel l jackson took off as well i would recommend this movie for all comic book fans marvel did change some important details from the comics but the movie is still spectacular
Mar 27 2019,negative,captain marvel was probably the worst movie in the mcu  ive watched every one of the movies in theaters since the beginning and am an avid comic book fanpatron  this movie falls flat from a story character and comedy standpoint  there are many scenes that just fall flat  the audience is led to believe certain characters are important to carrol but that feeling isnt shared by the audience due to lack of interaction andor screen time    the movie is watchable but it isnt worth seeing in theaters
Mar 27 2019,negative,saw the movie on the sunday at a relative popular time with about 11 other viewers acting could use improvement the fight scenes looked like they were sped up to look real but it was a joke i watched brie look like she was barely jogging and how the stunt doubles or extras basically cut their speed in half to a quarter to make it look real as shes escaping from the skulls the movie had plot holes and thr most important fact ms marvel was never the inspiration behind the avengers initiative
Mar 27 2019,positive,good film of origin but bad contribution to the mcu it changes several important aspects of previous movies of said universe and you can not connect with the main character without a doubt samuel l jackson is the best of the movie
Mar 27 2019,positive,the first 40 minutes are really boring and drawn out but the thing that saves this movie is nick fury and the final twist is very good itï 12 12 12 12tms ok but the last 45 minutes made this film a lot better
Mar 27 2019,positive,fantastic movie i am puzzled by the negative reviews mentioning the discrediting of men social agenda or political content from a very conservative dude i saw none of this a few folks clearly have an agenda great story good performances and solid leadin to end game
Mar 27 2019,positive,captain marvel is amazing it is  funnyaction packed and nostalgic if you didnt like it you are likely dead inside and im sorry for your loss
Mar 27 2019,positive,loved it absolutely loved it great work from samuel l jackson brie larson and lashana lynch among others i am reignited and ready for the next installment
Mar 27 2019,positive,decent but not great brie larson seemed joyless and her character lacked a relatable character arc 
Mar 27 2019,negative,this movie has errors in the script which i will list below    1 that nick fury tells captain marvel of his habits does not prove to captain that he is not a skrull since she does not know the customs of the skrulls  2 that captain marvel shows nick fury that she throws lightning bolts by the hands does not prove to nick that she is not a skrull since he does not know the powers of the skrulls  3 captain marvel realizes that nick fury betrayed her when she sees agent colson trying to capture her inside the pegasus installations so it does not make sense for her to return to save nick from the skrull    the film has other points that are not errors in the script but are laughable or unbelievable    1 in the movie the winter soldier nick says the last time i trusted someone i lost an eye in captain marvel nick loses his eye while he is playing with the flerken and this one scratches his eye it is disappointing to know that someone was a flerken  2 when the kree capture captain marvel for the second time and try to erase their memory using the supreme intelligence the captain frees herself simply by making a great mental effort so why the first time she could not free herself before the supreme intelligence that makes no sense  3 neither in the 90s nor at present there is artificial gravity within human spacecraft  4 it is not possible for captain marvel to communicate in real time with aliens who are separated from earth by tens hundreds or thousands of light years the laws of physics prevent it    this film did not have a villain that challenged the courage or the captains power but it did have several mediocre villains the film lacked quality in the scenes where the captain was animated with cgi which is very rare in a marvel movie the fans hope that in a future disney and marvel take care of the coherence in the script that they respect the laws of physics that they present us with heroic moments and that they animate the characters with an excellent cgi
Mar 26 2019,neutral,this fake female captain marvel is a flimsy tribute film honoring various random 90s  older pop flicks  cultural references    the story of the fake female captain marvel is like a cheap version of total recall    can you identify various retro cultural references from the film    whats disturbing is that arnold schwarzenegger acted better  is a better actor than brie larson in executing their respective movies scifi thriller story
Mar 26 2019,positive,such an awesome backstory for nick fury so happy to see him get more screen time brie larson was great in this role i was really expecting this to suck after seeing bad reviews but it turns out those are just misogynist trolls i suppose because this film was totally fine way better than many mcu films like captain america barf
Mar 26 2019,positive,its a marvel movie and its timing makes it purely a setup film for endgame which makes it a mustwatch its really the first origin story in a while from marvel that tries to take itself seriously even if it falls flat at times
Mar 26 2019,negative,an ok film with decent acting but the action scenes dont strike you as terribly original
Mar 26 2019,positive,i found this movie very boring  despite the fact this in an origin story i did not get to know or come to care about captain marvel  i mainly went to get ready for avengers endgame but it was not necessary to see this first  i would recommend seeing it prior to spiderman far from home 
Mar 26 2019,negative,not a very entertaining by marvel standards
Mar 26 2019,negative,while brie larsons performance was admirable the character of captain marvel was simply too emotionless and overly tough to give her some personalityâlike gal gadot had in wonder womanâwould have made this a much more enjoyable movie also they ruined nick furys backstory with that scene
Mar 26 2019,positive,effects were well done and film was entertaining despite the over saturation of super hero films
Mar 26 2019,positive,my favorite of all the marvel movies
Mar 26 2019,negative,worst marvel movie to date boring plot lame villain wooden acting
Mar 26 2019,neutral,while the special fx were amazing the storyline did not flow smoothly and kept the pace of the movie relative to a plot somewhat confusing  it wasjust okay
Mar 26 2019,negative,i havent had the chance to see very many movies this year but what i have seen has been disappointing i wanted this to succeed so badly
Mar 26 2019,negative,the story that originates the most powerful among the heroes can be an interesting premise at the first level but that is forgotten throughout the reproduction while are presented a story without grace and not captivating for more than 2 hours that it does not succeed at less to make interesting the universe galatic to which previously approached made in a lifeless and irrelevant way it just keeps a few good moments of humor but this film is definitely not as important as it should be and it can easily be ignored while sinking and reminding us that good things have not always come out of marvel studios
Mar 26 2019,negative,its a shame that nick fury spent all of phase 1 and 2 building up a badass reputation only to see one movie tear it all down
Mar 26 2019,negative,dry boring upsetting 
Mar 26 2019,negative,one of the worse marvels movie goofy cartoon 
Mar 26 2019,positive,its great all the character are great and i loved them i laughed and i honestly felt nostalgic  dont listen to the haters its great
Mar 26 2019,negative,the absolute worst mcu movie to date beyond the more than dozen plot holes ignoring time lines from previous mcu movies the story was obviously hastily written not edited and mis cast not sure how you can turn the skrulls into refugees they would have been better creating a race for the kree to victimize the cat was another mistake took that joke too far should have stopped at the skrull just being afraid of it fury should have lost his eye because of vers during the battle collateral damage they should have parted ways mad at each other that would have explained her not showing up in the other movies and him hiding her existence to the others overall this movie was terrible worse than thor 2
Mar 26 2019,positive,great addition to the mcu as a long time marvel fan this was highly enjoyable i feel like it is getting review bombed in most user reviews 
Mar 26 2019,negative,to say this movie is the worse of the marvel cinematic universe is an understatement it was lifeless and boring repetitive flash backs of captain marvel were over done i know it suppose to help the plot but to much i had more fun watching the first ten minutes of guardians of the galaxy than watching this entire movie i felt like it dragged between less than average fighting sequence the comedy relief by fury was the only positive thing about this movie this is no thor or no iron man or no ant man even wonder women was dare  i say better
Mar 26 2019,negative,yet another pseudofeminist superhero film that fails to have a decent story instead we get all the generic stuff done completely wrong
Mar 26 2019,positive,the movie doesnt deserve its high critisism from die hard marvel fans it wasnt as great as all the other movies but also not terrible  a decent production
Mar 26 2019,positive,acting was good characters were funny had attitude and their own personalities which i appreciated some parts of the storyline didnâtmt make much sense to me because the main character was supposed to be from another planet but it was still an enjoyable movie if you take it as it is
Mar 26 2019,positive,great as always marvel
Mar 26 2019,neutral,saw captain marvel much to my dismay but i was genuinely surprised that i didnt absolutely hate it brie larson just doesnt have the look or personality to pull off this character or any superhero to be honest however she was funny in some moments and i liked how she was very sarcastic this movie is not worth the hype that marvel and disney want you to believe it is you can always tell when a director or movie studio want you to believe that a movie is more important and epic than it really is the cat was the best part 
Mar 26 2019,negative,movie feel like it was rush could have been better mar vel death sucks just sad 
Mar 26 2019,positive,a good marvel movie i would rank it somewhere it the middle  the first 23 or 34 was really good  the battle in the space ship was hard to follow and parts didnt seem to flow well the twist with the skrulls was a surprise but they may have cheated a little in making us think they were bad guys at the start dont really like that they made them good guys in the marvel universe the skrulls made really good foes for the fantastic four in the comics  how fury loses his eye was just plain stupid movie almost deserves a two star rating just for that  middle credit scene was great
Mar 26 2019,positive,a jam packed addition to the mcu  a fresh take on their standard origin story the true standouts are the directors who have made this feel fresh  adventurous
Mar 26 2019,positive,aside from the depressing amount of sexism and slander in the reviews and the desperate need to try and rail on something i truly dont get the lower score      i could prequalify my statement showing credentials and knowledge and history in film and comics and marvel but thats not needed  when it comes down to it if someone can look at this movie without bias or an agenda or need to prove their self worth with a negative comment then its an excellent movie    5 stars simply to help offset the pathetic hate coming toward it     best marvel movie no sadly its not  is it a good movie most definitely     the humor is so well delivered its fresh and on point in a universe already known for those moments  some of the best to date are in here in my opinion      the writing is solid and i take a counter point from most im so glad they didnt weigh the story down with a mountain of back story building and how she got her powers  and to those critics even if they had there is no way to please those people  instead the movie knew which story it wanted to tell and told it  in an interesting and fun way  her different style as a hero her goals and finding her path were wonderful     and point blank this is how female empowerment movies should be  they absolutely nailed it shes imperfect shes not over compensating shes powerful and confident shes flawed and shes damaged and free to be herself and show what she can do  the small touches throughout brought that message home flawlessly and bree larson was phenomenal in this movie     people pointing to plot holes in the mcu are either a flat our liars  looking for something to harp on and slander the movie with  or b lacking understanding or grasp of the material  its not a complex question and this movie slides into place as perfectly as a puzzle piece can      moreover the movie was not what i expected while some points were obvious as all movies are the over all path was a beautiful and sometimes surprising one
Mar 26 2019,positive,marvellous is the word i would describe this film i when to see it with an open mind and no influence from spoilers etc and was pleasantly surprised it ticked all the boxes that make a great film and the cgi they used for nick fury is so realistic the only gripe i have though is when carol danvers speaks to the security guard in his car it is clearly nigh time but a few moments later it is all sunny wtf this sort of thing does piss me off lol
Mar 26 2019,positive,i wholeheartedly appreciated seeing a superhero movie with a strong female cast although i think the plot could have been improved upon it seemed like whenever the film had the opportunity to showcase the acting ability of the women they just threw in action scenes instead of taking the time to write a good scene
Mar 26 2019,positive,overall great movie and added many expectations to the next movie we will see carol danvers in 
Mar 26 2019,positive,i went to this movie expecting a 90s style movie and i wasnt disappointed  this movie is entertaining and thank god it was nothing like the comic books  capt marvel retconned is a better version of herself    for the acting  brie larson  12human 12kree 100 asskicking smartass    i liked her buddy cop dynamic with jacksons fury  they had a good dynamic and it felt natural  larson herself portrayed a person struggling with who she was and what she was  its a balancing act that even yon rogg explains within the movie    jackson was the same nick fury just younger btw  the cgi for age regression was well done      the friendship between maria and carol is legit military friendship thats fashioned from that lifestyle  their closeness is what anyone having been in the military would recognize as family      the low scores on this movie are amusing  its a movie based on a retconned comic book its not the reenvisioning of citizen cane      if youre looking to be entertained go see the movie
Mar 26 2019,negative,it felt like it had been written by an idiot terrible script average acting disgustingly cheesy and full of cliches   i fell asleep near the end and woke up pleased that i had with no inclination of wanting to find out what i had missed just churned out garbage with no heart or imagination
Mar 26 2019,positive,captain marvel is a good movie but it doesnt have that type of action like black panther and other marvel movies otherwise this is a good movie
Mar 26 2019,positive,i had my doubt before but the movie was good
Mar 26 2019,positive,captain marvel is well made superhero origin story with great cgi action and sense of humour
Mar 26 2019,positive,i really enjoyed this addition to the mcu
Mar 26 2019,neutral,kind of overly long disappointingly generic and not the feminist groundbreaking film i was expecting
Mar 26 2019,negative,barely passable as a comic book hero movie had some funny moments and sometimes the scenes were heart wrenching but i felt that all of the emotion came from the supporting cast the action wasnï 12tmt really action i didnï 12tmt once think that the main character was in any danger never mind mortal danger she dealt with foes easily and everything that stood up to her was swatted down like a fly i am also not a huge fan of the direction the film writers took but being a big marvel fan and having faith in their plans iï 12tmll sit tight to judge that at a later date
Mar 26 2019,negative,the movie has an interesting story samuel l jackson performs very well and the team that worked on making him look younger did a great job the effects in general are great the aliens look like a copypasted standard humanoid alien nothing unique or original the aliens in the comics look better and more interesting brie larson is not that good of an actress and she lacks the charisma needed to portray captain marvel then again nowadays at least captain marvel doesnt appear charismatic at all and is quite unlikable movie would have been a lot better if the lead actress either performed better or was a different actress altogether
Mar 26 2019,positive,it was great  i dont know if my son or my daughter liked it more but there have been several requests to see it again  it may have been a little formulaic but the 90s throwback vibe more than makes up for it
Mar 26 2019,neutral,i felt it was a very average movie cinematically beautiful storywise different but main actress was average she wasnt bad she just isnt memorable when you look at every marvel character they have a key characteristic that stands out among the rest she just doesnt seem to have that key trait
Mar 26 2019,positive,overall a good film the characters for the most part were good the story although at times didnt make scene was good the reverse aging effects on samuel l jackson and clark gregg were amazing the cat was hilarious lastly the villeins although no ego or thanos were done well overall i liked it
Mar 26 2019,negative,the worst marvel movie ever absoloutly boring far to family feeling focused no identifiable story very poor action a nick fury doushbag and no ties to infinity war whatsoever ms larson has only 1 expression pissed off
Mar 26 2019,positive,i really enjoyed marvel cinematic universes captain marvel there were both suspenseful and comedic aspects throughout the film that kept the plot interesting some people believe brie larson was wrong for the role of carol danvers captain marvel but i beg to differ she took the role very seriously and i believe she was the perfect choice for the role if you have not seen the movie yet i highly recommend it and hope you enjoy it as much as i did
Mar 26 2019,neutral,boring broke storyline non existing character development does not feel she feels remorse that she was part of the genocide of the skrulls by the kree she only repaint her space nazi uniform nick fury loses much with that character depiction as the tough commander of shield bullshit ilostmyeyetosomeoneitrust story    i hope that cap marvel doesnt get so much screen time in the future or get a rewrite but i fear this char would taint by affection of the mcu
Mar 26 2019,neutral,definitely one of the weaker mcu movies as has to cover a lot of ground in a shortish space of time butstill awesome i need to see it again before committing really but will throw down a 35 stars for now edit a rewatch has shown me that strangely the role of danvers herself is my least favourite thing about this movie with the supporting actors picking up a lot of the slack
Mar 26 2019,positive,great movie bree larson was wonderful i loved her kooky personality this is a feel good movie just what i want when i go to the movies 
Mar 26 2019,positive,theres hardly any identity politics and didnt fail to entertain me
Mar 26 2019,positive,this is undoubtedly another marvel film it already has a familiar formula but the advantages in the form of characters their interaction and a couple of plot twists make this movie more than onetime entertainment there are two scenes after the credits and a hilarious reference to indiana jones at the end i will not describe for the reasons you can understand but whoever looked would understand
Mar 26 2019,positive,a solid mcu movie with a distractingly bad soundtrack
Mar 26 2019,negative,my least favorite mcu movie pacing issues throughout i couldnt have felt less involved
Mar 26 2019,positive,stunning witty heart felt   i had goosebumps and a proud heart
Mar 26 2019,negative,captain cadbury creme seems wooden and unhappy maybe  she needs an enema i give it to an a half stars out of choir my friend gave it a six because he couldâtmve put on the headphones when our captain marxist sj wahmen came on screech screen i really donâtmt think that this deserves a negative rating rating i donâtmt know how people can give it a negative rating i mean you know thereâtms some special a fax and stuff in there theyâtmre pretty cool but i think i would give rt a negative rating
Mar 26 2019,negative,this is a yikes from me dawg
Mar 26 2019,negative,god that was painful any chance of a refund
Mar 26 2019,positive,absolutely loved it 
Mar 26 2019,positive,one of the best movies so fare in 2019 i really love what they did for stan lee
Mar 26 2019,positive,it captain marvel is not the ï 12cookie cutterï 12tm made out by some reviews but rather a jigsaw piece that fits beautifully into the mcu her debut is at least on a par with two other mcu greats iron man and captain america if not better clever sassy and emotive this film should have you thinking about what happened long after you left the theater
Mar 26 2019,negative,poor story and acting lacks character arc unlikable main lead
Mar 26 2019,positive,literally the definition of perfection 1210
Mar 26 2019,positive,as much as i applaud the decision to finally produce a hero movie at marvel with a female lead the writing unfortunatley didnt offer any new plot and follows the typical story structure all the early marvel films followed thats ok but nothing beyond dc told a new story with wonder woman which was great therefore
Mar 26 2019,positive,i think it is a good movie but it isnâtmt great movie as marvel says
Mar 26 2019,positive,i would really give the movie 4 or 45 but all the trolls out there acting like this was the worst movie they have ever seen really good movie in my opinion if you like marvel movies dont believe what you read go see the movie and form your own opinion 
Mar 26 2019,negative,simply not a good movie plit was okay but no where near the standard set for marvel movies 
Mar 26 2019,positive,good but felt rushed
Mar 26 2019,negative,a horrible claptrap with an unlikeable hero who spends the whole time frowning at the camera samuel l jaskson is occasionally funny and there is interesting chemistry with him and brie larson thatï 12tms the end of the positive things i can say it isnï 12tmt inspiring instead it talks down to you itï 12tms sad because all marvel had to do was copy what dc did with wonder woman make a hyper powerful woman character that still has a sense of vulnerability give her a challenge and let her overcome it that works regardless of the gender of the character but instead it made her an unhappy victim of a bunch of gender based harassment and she rises above it it was cliche and selling a ï 12wokeï 12 narrative do better marvel
Mar 26 2019,negative,found the movie to be more boring then anything even during fight scenes
Mar 25 2019,positive,captain marvel was absolutely fantastic im a dc guy myself and this was damn cool just a fun time go see it and enjoy and stop with the marvel dc rivalry bs this movie was great 
Mar 25 2019,negative,not exactly a bad movie but weak by mcu standards  not essential viewing for those waiting to see avengers endgame it doesnt tell anything you wont already know from trailers and the avengers infinity war postcredits scene  kids who enjoy superhero action and cute cats will love it
Mar 25 2019,negative,i did not like it found it slow and sappy the story has been changed and not for the better this movie seems to try hard to reach woman and girls made for a very boring movie
Mar 25 2019,positive,it was entertaining with a slight meh
Mar 25 2019,positive,i love it so much also carol and maria definitely are lesbians lol
Mar 25 2019,negative,marvel dropped the ball with this one also it didnt help that this was the most boring villain in the mcu
Mar 25 2019,negative,if this captain marvel is going to be the head of the next phase o mcu the mcu is doomed
Mar 25 2019,negative,captain marvel doesnt pack much of a punch    the film struggles to set a consistent tone throughout and never really recovers from the lackluster opening act    the main character of captain marvel is strangely written brie larson isnt given a whole lot to say or do in this film she herself seems bored at times resulting in a very onedimensional protagonist and unexciting superhero flick    there never really feels like there is anything at stake because the characters and plot arent properly fleshed out our marvel heroes typically face some kind of personal challenge that requires selfreflection and growth as a person to overcome that staple of superhero origin stories is absent here and it makes the whole thing feel kind of hollow    i try to stay away from the political commentary surrounding this film but it is clear that the filmmakers did not shy away from it because this film is very self aware and borderlines on pretentious with is underhanded message in this case i would say it hurt the films quality which is a sad day for cinema
Mar 25 2019,positive,thoroughly enjoyed the film dunno what all the fuss is about 
Mar 25 2019,positive,awesome movie great action and very funny
Mar 25 2019,negative,all the forced comedy you can handle and an entire stadium full of who cares  i feel like marvel handed this film off to the second team while the first team concentrated on avengers end game  in conclusion i watch 2 hours of garbage to find out that the avengers now have a female superman on their side woohoo
Mar 25 2019,negative,predictably bad plot and acting
Mar 25 2019,positive,i was very happy with captain marvel they did a great job tying up loose ends and filling in several details in the mcu the humor in the last several movies is becoming too big a part of the experience in my opinion i prefer story plot twists and action reaching too hard for humor waters down the effect of the movie theres no place for jar jar binks in the mcu
Mar 25 2019,negative,writing very lazy no effort seems to have been put in just a quick payday
Mar 25 2019,positive,i honestly canï 12tmt understand why people are actually calling this the worst mcu movie i personally loved it it had a compelling story and great moments and no where near thor the dark world territory now yes larsonï 12tms acting wasnï 12tmt super great but by no means distracting and sheï 12tmll get better hopefully people were also outraged on nick furyï 12tms eye loss scene and how anticlimactic it was do i wish the way he lost his eye was more epic yes i do but it was nothing to be hugely upset over it was still a funny moment this movie doesnï 12tmt have to be extremely serious just because it is immediately followed by endgame endgame of course should be lots of people are expecting huge and major events like in the avengers movies and are angry that it barely revealed anything out endgame thatï 12tms not gonna happen because the russo brothers have confirmed that we will not see anywhere past the first 20 minutes of endgame in any shape or form until the actual movie comes out so there should be no surprise besides the end credits scene we got with the avengers was pretty satisfying anyways in my opinion     at the end of the day if you genuinely just did not like this movie i respect that view however saying that it trashed the mcu is simply false did it have a few flaws yes but in the end it had more pluses than negatives
Mar 25 2019,positive,a decent origin story with a decent execution a solid ok performance from the leads people will definitely enjoy the movieâtms common display of marvel formula though less in extravagance its mojo has never ran out of appeal the problem i see is its âoknessâ so donâtmt try comparing it with ww but for sure i want to see more of her on the last avengers captain marvel is insanely powerful sheâtms almost unstoppable that makes me think why fury waited this long to page her i enjoy seeing this girl kick some ass i also like her sarcasm and subtle acting itâtms tasty
Mar 25 2019,positive,captain marvel is a fun comicbased superhero action flick that has a nostalgic retro feel due to its setting humor and music however it is indeed a movie for the new era as it tells the story of a powerful woman who breaks free from the mental confinements and unjustified subservience of her male superiors and soon becomes a radiating force of truth and justice
Mar 25 2019,negative,movie not only broke comic canon broke the mcu canon humor was flat audience was really low energy during and after this film reflects the mundane tone and plot of the movie unfortunate
Mar 25 2019,positive,the humor was pretty lame goose was the best thing about this movie they need the guardian or deadpool screenwriters here
Mar 25 2019,negative,weak af i would have been more understanding if this subpar movie about a superhero that no one knows about was made by dc for marveldisney to have green lighted this right before the avengers movie comes out makes me think that disney is now lacking in the marvel universe and the future of the avengers looks bleak this movie was supposed to rival wonder woman wtf
Mar 25 2019,negative,this character was written horribly just so she could be showcased as a strong woman but instead made captain marvel more of a joke than she already is in the movie if thanos faces off against her in the next movie i hope thanos wins lol stop being lazy and write your characters betters every other female in the mcu is strong without the need to emphasize that shes a woman such as okoye black widow scarlett witchetc also the nicky fury eye accident was a letdown
Mar 25 2019,neutral,pretty meh and easily one of the weakest marvel movies but alright popcorn entertainment sadly its a missed opportunity for a truly awesome female heroine origins story i had hoped for more
Mar 25 2019,negative,i saw it so to balance the rating
Mar 25 2019,positive,captain marvel is a decent movie it has funny parts and action packed parts but it felt like there was alot crammed in i would rate it 75
Mar 25 2019,negative,very tedious and a hard to focus on film cat was better than the main character
Mar 25 2019,positive,captain marvel is one of the best movies ive ever seen carol danvers cm is both hilarious and strong the plot was amazing as a 14 year old girl it feels amazing to see a female led movie in the mcu ive been a huge fan of marvel for a while now
Mar 25 2019,positive,really good addition to the mcu  good storyline added lots of cool background to the other films excited for more of carol
Mar 25 2019,negative,it simply was the worst movie i have seen in years
Mar 25 2019,positive,fun movie we all enjoyed it 
Mar 25 2019,neutral,it was fine i guess
Mar 25 2019,negative,the shame of this movie is what killed stan lee
Mar 25 2019,negative,as a diehard marvel fan im pretty shocked that im writing a one star review but i believe that i have more than enough reasons to justify this     as a diehard marvel fan i take no pleasure in giving this movie a one star rating but sadly the movie gave me plenty of reason to ill only list a few in this review    captain marvel has most often been described as mediocre but i think even that is being generous this movie is below average which is a rarity for marvel movies     this movie fails to develop anything close to an interesting origin story carol gets her powers by complete accident and frankly why this accident gave her powers instead of killing her is not even explained it just happened imagine a captain american origin story where he accidentally receives the super soldier serum and for reasons that are totally outside of his understanding is now a superhero he did not earn it or go through any significant trials he is simply now a superhero     she is so absurdly overpowered that the most accurate comparison i can think of is that of superman except that captain marvel has no equivalent to kryptonite at least that im aware of     captain marvel introduces several plot holes and inconsistencies within the broader mcu timeline and even manages to slightly downgrade other mcu movies such as the winter soldier due to plot implications it has for that movie     the origin of nick furys eyepatch was not only underwhelming it was absurd it felt like a massive middle finger to the audience and any nick fury fans out there who care about the character and were hoping for a more compelling backstory to one of his most famous attributes     bries acting was simply put not good it felt uninspired bored and lacked any sense of emotion i was actively looking for opportunities to latch on to her character and care about her but none came im not sure what kevin feige was thinking in introducing this character into the mcu into endgame the likes of steve bruce natasha and tony deserve better
Mar 25 2019,negative,your usual marvel fair except this one lacks structure and humor and seems determined to insult the audience  1 star for the slj appearance
Mar 25 2019,negative,saw this movie two days after it was released and shazam for an early screening  hands down shazam beats this film
Mar 25 2019,positive,answers many questions that the viewer may have from almost all of the marvel movies great acting by brie larson and the rest of the cast
Mar 25 2019,negative,brie larson equates to worst casting choice made by marvel
Mar 25 2019,negative,if they had removed the total wokeness from this movie it would have been much better i just wish they would balance the pc stuff just a little
Mar 25 2019,positive,i like it  fun filled movie for kids and adults great cast great acting and killer sound track
Mar 25 2019,positive,i dont understand all the mess around the scores and brie larson as the protagonist considering that this was a good origin story for the mcu it was fun entertaining and evaded some annoying clichã cs found in other female lead movies
Mar 25 2019,negative,this movie was horrible you will cringe throughout the entire movie dont waste your money on this
Mar 25 2019,positive,captain marvel follows the marvel formula and becomes a decent addition to the shared universe but due to the leads bland acting a convoluted story and the slow pacing this new solo film shows to be inferior to the last entrees in the franchise despite having an amazing soundtrack and great visuals
Mar 25 2019,neutral,it wasnt bad but it wasnt good either the main character had no real struggles throughout the movie her powers are way overpowered especially from where she got them from her character seems like a cheap way to solve endgame
Mar 25 2019,negative,was this film highly anticipated yes it was did it deliver the goods not really    captain marvel began with a very good beginning but began to become dry half way and the main character barely had any emotions reminded of the main character of twilight it just lacked what a traditional marvel movie has and was probably one of the worst marvel films in this cinematic universe    when i look at a good female lead superhero film i look at wonder woman now thats how a movie should be not this lack luster title
Mar 25 2019,negative,this film couldve been so much better this is a let down in the same way that i believe the hulk films were a let down poor story great actors but poor acting and an all in all lack luster movie save this one for netflix it is not required viewing to enjoy the upcoming avengers movie
Mar 25 2019,neutral,this is an ok origin story a little boring to begin  some of the jokes were lost on my 13 year old  i could have waited for the video stream though
Mar 25 2019,positive,its certainly not the best superhero or mcu movie but it also isnt the worst the visuals in it are stunning and the performances are pretty good overall though the story just comes across and formulaic with nothing really new to offer it does take a couple twists and turns but nothing super exciting however it serves its purpose in introducing us to this character as well as showing what her connection will be going forward in this vast universe marvel has created
Mar 25 2019,negative,really boring movie plot and brie larson was a terrible actor for the role worst film in the mcu bar far
Mar 25 2019,positive,it was a better than average marvel movie there was good acting but somewhat of a weak villain i still dont particularly like captain marvel but i am okay with her 
Mar 25 2019,positive,first things first i think that this was an amazing movie i think that brie larson did an amazing job and really surprised some people i also want to say that the cgi and animations were stunning everybody on the animation team did an amazing job my only complaint about the movie is that it didnt feel like a classic marvel movieï 12 12ï 12â to me the whole outer space and aliens theme is still kind of new to the mcu but it felt more like a star wars movie to me they could have been a little more original with the spaceships and whatnot but it was still on point anyways i would highly recommend this movie
Mar 25 2019,negative,the worst film of mcu
Mar 25 2019,negative,i felt like i must have come in half way through the movie as i had no idea what was gong on nor did i care
Mar 25 2019,neutral,the movie was okay the pacing of the movie was totally off and i felt no emotional growth in captain marvel the whole movie there really wasnt as much of a payoff at the end of the movie as i was expecting its too bad really if the writing was better i feel like i could really enjoy this movie
Mar 25 2019,negative,not very good the entire move was nothing but cliche after cliche about how the men are all pigs and she is going to set the record straight blah blah blah the story was very disjointed no good character development really flat acting not the worst marvel movie but certainly not the best
Mar 25 2019,positive,the movie is so much slow and the references are poor at least its a good movie but far from marvels quality
Mar 25 2019,negative,this movie gave me a headache with all the jumping around it did during the story it did more to disrupt the mcu timeline than it did to help it from changing how fury lost his eye to showing that shield has been around longer than first stated in iron man this movie does more to disrupt the flow of the series than helps it this movie should have come out sooner within the series
Mar 25 2019,positive,the movie was ok but nothing very memorable ever happens and it never felt epic at all
Mar 25 2019,positive,personally i believe that this film has been receiving too much grief simply as a result of the incredibly high quality of many recent marvel projects    while the film does present several issues primarily related to poor pacing and preachy exposition i find it to be a solid film and by no means marvels weakest effort  brie larson came across as likable and as real as a spacewarriorhero could be  while i found her character and the script to be a bit stoic and inorganic at times i find it to be somewhat consistent to the source material which makes that easier to swallow  samuel jackson is solid as nick fury and i will say that the tech used to reverse his aging is miles better than anything ive seen over the last several years in the star wars universe  jude law is great however i feel like the film fails to make viewers care much about his existence    for me ben mendelsohn as talos is the biggest surprise and most redeemable quality of the film  his performance is fun and for me he picked up the film and carried it to the finish
Mar 25 2019,negative,i dont believe there was a moment in this movie that gave me any reason to care about the characters from the terrible comic relief corny lines bad casting and a cookie cutter formula this is one forgetful film you may think this is merely one persons opinion but if its any confirmation  our theater was full and everyone started talking before the movie was over not one person told anyone else to stop talking so theres that
Mar 25 2019,neutral,it was average not a 110 or a 1010 no real character development in the film and you never really feel threatened by the situation there was decent chemistry between marvel and fury though and some funny moments overall captain marvel didnt really have a personality and the plot and execution of said plot was meh
Mar 25 2019,positive,marvelous a competent film that introduces a new character to the fold who isnt perfect but doesnt have to be
Mar 25 2019,negative,director did a bad job     tha main actor just cant act in that role    seriosly hoping she doesnt play a main role in endgame fans have invested a lot of time into the movies and if they fck it up with an underdeveloped char last sec just smh
Mar 25 2019,negative,i didnt have high expectations for this so anything would have wowed me not worth the money special effects not good jokes were bad main character not relateable and annoying story line is lacking just so much bad
Mar 25 2019,positive,fun movie and great action scenes not sure why so much hate
Mar 25 2019,positive,solid 4 12 stars i went into captain marvel with trepidation and came out a true believer easily one of my top 10 mcu movies
Mar 25 2019,positive,captain marvel was a highly entertaining movie and was one of the first marvel movies i have been excited about in a long time with the exception of black panther capt marvel is a female character we havenâtmt seen from marvel she is stoic tough and fiercely independent whereas black widow is sympathetic and a teamplayer not every woman is emotionalkindsweet and throughout the movie you learn why capt marvel is who she is not remembering her human heritage and being conditioned to withhold emotion probably played a role for one that said such a female personality is not as palatable to male audiences who have criticized her lack of âhumanityâ â hello she spent the last siz years basically living with unemotional klingons and doesnâtmt remember being human as say sweet wonder woman who falls in love with her male colead and even less palatable when said âemotionlessâ woman is portrayed to be kicking or saving menâtms butts left and right personally i applaud the portrayal of a nontraditional female personality as well as these feminist aspects of the film  1lack of a love interest â capt marvel does not swoon over a male costar nor does she need one to helpsave her she is enough on her own a positive lesson for girls obviously i donâtmt mean movies where the female lead falls for the male lead are evil just that itâtms nice to see some versions where the female lead is sufficient on her own to carry the story  2her suit is fullcoverage and functional though i loved wonder woman i thought her armor was classic but grievously outdated she fights in a strapless minidress for gosh sake itâtms simply impractical and doesnâtmt make sense for such a strong character in contrast capt marvelâtms suit is practical donâtmt have to worry about a nip slip or panty flash functional doubles as a space suit but still maintains sex appeal iâtmm not saying female superheroes should be unattractive and wear a potato sack just that their clothes should make sense for fight scenes and such  overall capt marvel was a great movie from an entertainment aspect and also a step forward for femalelead super hero movies i will definitely be watching it again
Mar 25 2019,negative,preface i am burned out on the mcu movies in general  some friends wanted to go to watch and i figured why not    the popcorn was amazing  the movie not so much  there were some shining moments as well as a few good laughs  the nod back in time to director fury was enjoyable  the tie in with other characters in the mcu was appreciated    i felt that a good chunk of the actors were flat  i didnt feel interested in their story or how they were trying to present themselves  my wife took offense to a particular line in the movie which i couldnt understand the purpose of either i wont mention it just saying there was a line      the story itself is the rinse and repeat super hero plotline which is what i am getting tired of in the mcu  that said there have been some movies in the mcu which were better acted and more interesting that kept my attention  i literally found myself zoning out at times and wondering what size fasteners hold the speakers to the wall  not kidding
Mar 25 2019,negative,poor enough probably worst mcu movie to date
Mar 25 2019,positive,i beleve marvel missed the opportutniy to tie this moving in with the mcu with theiir inconsistent history displayed in this movie  there are some plot holes that are had for hardcore mcu fans to ingnore  brie larson does a fine job but her seriousness throughout the movie is a little inconsistent from other mcu films  i also do not see how it adds a lot to what fans should expect in avengers endgame
Mar 25 2019,positive,this movie really made me change my views on womanhood it made me feel good about being a woman it made me feel proud somehow after i watched it i could feel myself walking more confidently i didnâtmt tried to avoid looking into other peopleâtms eyes while i talked i could feel like my voice was better and more confident     also the plot of the movie is so raw and present some real worldâtms  issues appeared and made me think about them differently it was one of the best origins movie marvel made in my opinion brie larson and samuel l jackson are an amazing duo and their acting is just divine itâtms definitely worth the watch
Mar 25 2019,negative,this is the worst movie in the mcu brie larson has no acting ability samuel l jacksons nick fury was ruined with ridiculous sentiment and the story itself was terrible at best the only saving grace if there is any is ben mendelsohn and jude laws characters outstanding performances how she got her powers her quirky one liners and pretty much any scene where larson leads is just awful my girlfriend fell asleep and i fell enraged no real action until the very end her overpowered destruction was incredibly lackluster a terrible movie that doesnt belong in the mcu
Mar 25 2019,negative,captain marvel accomplishes plot points as if it were checking boxes and while larsonï 12tms performance has glimpses of grandeur particularly at the beginning of the film her performance is otherwise restrained by an amateurish script the movie wields the lack of character development as if it were making the point that captain marvel didnï 12tmt need it as a result the overpowered super saiyan at the end of the film is just a more powerful version of the same woman you met at the beginning and she achieved this power through inexplicable contrivance     triumphing over the patriarchy and honoring the fundamentals of storytelling are not mutually exclusive the film was entertaining however the 78 fresh score provided by critics at the time of this review is an absolute mystery to me
Mar 25 2019,positive,let me be honest not one of marvels best works very slow boring start like a good 20 minutes into the film and the lead actress brie larsons acting was wooden that being said it was still very enjoyable to watch past the slow start and it was the other characters that really made the movie for me
Mar 25 2019,negative,minor spoiler it wasnt good and to tell you the truth brie wasnt great but she wasnt the worst actor in the movie her pilot friend was buy far the worst actor in the movie it is never a good look when a kid out acts an adult the solution to the story was given away in the first scene there was no quest to save the day the terror of a bad guys that changes form was never fully utilizes the story seemed disjointed and had me turning to my gf every few seconds asking did i miss something the director has no concept of how to cut on action so every scene begins and ends with a static shot the make up looked like a bad rubber mask the switch of the bad guys happen after little more and a polite conversation these are aliens who live off of deception they literally change form and she believes them with no reluctance at all the pace was jumpy and felt unnatural to watch as if they cut out scenes at random the cinematography was bad if your actor has black hair you either back light them or have a decently light back ground so they dont disappear i had no emotional connection to any of the characters except maybe the little girl who did an amazing job samuel jackson was good but the comedy people were raving about wasnt written it was performed meaning samuel jackson took lines that werent necessarily funny buy themselves and made them funny good job for him but one actor can not save a film buy himself  the solution of removing the sticker wasnt earned so because of  this the climax screamed of deus ex machina the people claiming this was a standard origin story did not watch the same movie i did because the origin was little more than flashes at least a standard origin story would include a story and thats my greatest complaint is lack of anything resembling inventive story telling
Mar 25 2019,positive,lots of fun and definitely worth coming out for captain marvel was great
Mar 25 2019,negative,by far the worst mcu movie  also i made this review once before but it somehow is no longer posted so im reposting
Mar 25 2019,positive,i kinda thot that the cg was off at times mainly when they tried to cg the cat but apart from that the movie was amazing i liked that the enemy turned out to be good would watch again
Mar 25 2019,neutral,story was great interesting to follow brie larsonâtms character was aimed to feel witty sarcastic and funny she executed it badly and seemed emotionless also she never sounded surprised sad happy anything she sounded pretty bored
Mar 25 2019,positive,so empowering brie larson is the est person i know
Mar 25 2019,negative,a fair bit of ret con and the thing with goose and fury is a bit silly some good special effects tho i would only go and see if ur a hardcore marvel fan
Mar 25 2019,negative,captain marvel was not that great of a movie especially by mcu standards  i understand why it is doing so well it rests heavily on identity politics and it is a mcu movie that promised to add another piece to what will most likely be the biggest movie of all time endgame
Mar 25 2019,positive,testing those stupid conspiracies  the movie was entertaining enough  some flaws here and there  but good enough to watch in theater once  a c movie  let see if the so call rating change without my permission
Mar 25 2019,positive,while the films exposition takes too long to start the plot captain marvel gives the mcu one of its best protagonists to date incredible visual fx and a hilarious script make this film an absolute joy
Mar 25 2019,negative,wish i had not paid for imax tickets for this gibberish there is better entertainment on tv for free the only redeeming things are some of the funny moments not even the special effects could save this one
Mar 25 2019,positive,went to the theatre with an open mind thought this movie was pretty dope hilarious at times and had great action scenes as well was very entertaining although i found it a waste as to how nick fury lost his eye
Mar 25 2019,positive,really good movie and story cant belive the audiences ratings arent higher
Mar 25 2019,negative,the story was bad characters were poor visuals and music sucked and the action scenes might have been the worst part btw im not a troll
Mar 25 2019,negative,this should be called captain average who cares why care and what makes these characters watchableare still my main question leaving this middle down the road movie
Mar 25 2019,neutral,subpar terrible casting marvel fatigue is real
Mar 25 2019,positive,it was funny there were great action sequences and i just absolutely loved it    got to find out how fury lost his eye too    music was amazing a ton of 90s nostalgia  loved the whole movie  brie larson is perfect as carol
Mar 25 2019,positive,surprisingly dull its like the spirit that took the mcu to the top has been softened and now were back to getting bad superhero movies where the essence of the character is never discussed there is no character flaw on display no struggle to overcome just a dull display of raw power with no downside and no sense of itself we literally have no idea what the characters limits nor strengths are a step back
Mar 25 2019,positive,brie larson does a bang up job of bringing an incredibly strong female character to the big screen of the many flaws in this movie brie and ben mendelsohn are not them brie as carol danvers delivers an amazing strong femal hero and ben delivers in spades as talos the tamed this movie is definitely worth your action dollars in the theater but there are extended moments where you feel that were it not for brie absolutely nailing this role that the movie would have been the first really poor movie
Mar 25 2019,positive,fun if fairly formulaic super hero flick had a good time watching it and loved how charming the skrulls were nothing mindblowing but very enjoyable
Mar 25 2019,positive,this was absolutely fun and inspiring and energizing i loved watching my 11 year old daughter loving every minute of it more please
Mar 25 2019,positive,i reluctantly went to  see this movie trying to put all of the controversy nonsense aside i found it to be a good superhero movie not marvels best but not near the bottom either like most have said talos and goose steal most scenes in which they appear sam jackson is sam jackson and brie larson did a much better job than i had been lead to believe from the reviews of some others my biggest criticism of the film was the choice using of just a girl in the big fight scene it seemed like a message forced and to me seemed really out of place     overall a good movie im looking forward to seeing where captain marvel fits in with the rest of the mcu going forward
Mar 25 2019,positive,great movie entertaining and action filled with the right amount of heart and humour itâtms one of the better superhero movies that doesnâtmt take itself too seriously and has an actual solid plot that can actually be followed great visuals and character development
Mar 25 2019,positive,really enjoyed captain marvel i am not a huge super hero fan and only went because it was part of zoãs birthday present im glad i did the story line is great and well told the characters are engaging and there is plenty of humour best marvel film since kenneth brannaghs thor
Mar 25 2019,positive,great for the entire family
Mar 25 2019,positive,good movie top ten in my opinion for a marvel movie 
Mar 25 2019,negative,for the last 80 years captain america was the first avenger along comes an unlikable and not wellreceived comic by fans or critics hero that marvel demands we now accept as the inspiration for the avengers  which begs the question is there an agenda being forced down our throats    disappointed with the story poor character development no tension bad pacing never cared for any of the characters disappointed with the lead larson seemed wholly inorganic boringly uninspiring and completely uninterested in the role like she just walked on the set and read her lines that day  disappointed with the science nonsensical larson was so bad and the story so weak this should have been reworked to be an origin story for fury     overall disappointing
Mar 25 2019,positive,great movie right up there with the other marvel greats pretty sad to see trolls post bad reviews i dont know why or for what purpose but dont believe the trolls i had read bad reviews saying bri larson was not the right actor for the roll i disagree i thought she did a great job she brought humor strength and realistic portrayal to the character i am familiar with female fighter pilots and she pretty much nailed the attitude
Mar 25 2019,negative,the story line was good in my opinion larsons was not a good actress in this movie completely dry acting furthermore they once again politicized the movie wish theyd stop doing that
Mar 25 2019,negative,story was lackluster everything was predictable and boring brees acting was flat the girl power thing was fine but got overplayed quick fury coulson the cat and 90s flashbacks were the only entertaining things we were left wanting
Mar 25 2019,negative,a generic marvel film that does not even give enough character development to its characters emphasis on samuel jacksons nick fury
Mar 25 2019,positive,nothing too out of the ordinary  a pretty formulaic film and tbh brie larson wasnt partiularly standout nice to see a bit of backstory about nick fury though
Mar 25 2019,negative,this is the worst movie i have ever seen how is a marvel movie this cheesy i only paid 6 bucks to see it and i want my money back 
Mar 25 2019,negative,it was ok nothing new to see here and very predictable colson and furry were the best part of the movie i felt captain marvel was boring and a bit of a mary sue shame it could have been better
Mar 25 2019,negative,mostly underwhelming the greatest feels from this movie stem from its connections to the wider mcu not the development of the character or her story  visually the movie was impressive particularly the deageing of fury and coulson otherwise the movie is largely forgettable i wouldnt say this movie was terrible so much as that it is inconsequential they created a largely formulaic origin story in the middle of a mostly generic military conflict in order to be a vehicle for a decent but ultimately forgettable performance by a female lead rather than being a triumph of feminism i think this movie failed because the story was confusing and trite larsons character perhaps due to writing and direction was wooden arrogant and anticlimactic to make it worse there are obvious themes of sj that are forced into this story which are clear nods to socialpolitical trends im glad that i streamed this online and didnt waste 12 in the theater
Mar 25 2019,negative,bad movie the story was completely shit i was so bored that i was watching youtube instead of the movie one of my friends slept the whole movie thats how bad it was
Mar 25 2019,positive,this movie is extremely mediocre and captain marvel herself seems so boring and uninteresting her backstory doesnt really work either
Mar 25 2019,negative,this was the first mcu film that failed to keep my full interest i had no problem tearing myself from the film for snack and bathroom breaks it wasnt terrible but it just lacked that usual mcu magic and excitement
Mar 25 2019,positive,the movie was fun lighthearted and a had a solid storyline it seems though that this is one of those films that you need to watch more than once to truly appreciate it it was great the first go around but fantastic the second time
Mar 25 2019,positive,the movie was great  i have watch it twice in the theaters now 
Mar 25 2019,positive,outstanding film visually spectacular  great tie ins to the rest of mcu so much girl power
Mar 25 2019,positive,amazing  witty  fun  actionpacked  nick fury geeking out over a cat  cmon  manbabies  suck up your tears  this movie kickedass
Mar 25 2019,positive,i love it captain marvel is the best 
Mar 25 2019,positive,its an awesome movie i watched it some many times im start fall for brie larson acting as carol danverscaptain marvel 
Mar 24 2019,negative,i was not able to keep my focus as it was boring most of the time except for samuel jackson even though i so didnt like the story of how he lost his eye
Mar 24 2019,positive,another great marvel film captain marvel soars
Mar 24 2019,positive,i felt like carol substitute continents for planets superpowers for alien races and the story seems real the intergalactic deep state is exposed for all its gory horror a shithole comment is made i give it four stars because the action is hard to follow
Mar 24 2019,negative,the movie isnt horrible but its just not what i look for in a mcu film the main character cp didnt really have anything i could relate to she almost didnt have any emotions and didnt really make me care for her i never felt like if she could ever lose there was no danger for her
Mar 24 2019,negative,shocking marvel made something this off just feels like the movie was missing something 
Mar 24 2019,negative,save your money go watch alita
Mar 24 2019,positive,theres something about an origin story that always feels fresher than the combined films loved the storyline and  the characters as a fan of the comics i was surprised how much i enjoyed brie larson as captain marvel and jackson as a young nick fury was fantastic
Mar 24 2019,positive,a great addition to the marvel cinematic universe for noncomic book fans this movie brings a new and additional female face to an already fun group of characters once again marvel has used the formula of easy humor and big action to make a great popcorn movie for the marvel storyline moving forward this captain will fit right in i have noticed that most of the negative reviews are by men using high end vocabulary to tear down something not built to garner an oscar
Mar 24 2019,positive,good movie not great but good
Mar 24 2019,positive,all in all a pretty good movie except that it was a little too politicized for me 
Mar 24 2019,positive,one of the best superhero origin films made
Mar 24 2019,neutral,i personally found this movie to be quiet cheesy and boring the action sequences are cute theyre a little something something its sad to see such a highly anticipated marvel movie be such a letdown also the main character whos a female by the way is so bland and emotionless throughout the entire movie with the exception of the little kid scene they literally gave the protagonist little to no character at all they probably just told her to be badass and this is what she gave us emotionless and dull badass doesnt mean emotionless stonecold being of life by the way
Mar 24 2019,positive,loved the background story that was fulfilled in heros story
Mar 24 2019,positive,it was a good movie
Mar 24 2019,negative,this is a boring slowpaced poorly told story as mary sue movies usually are the feminist cliches just add further insult 
Mar 24 2019,negative,the movies entire premise doesnt make any sense the acting was sub par and the film does not fit into the mcua story line even as a stand alone movie it was awful the storyline doesnt make sense at all not to mention the details about main character arcs for the mcu that are just glossed over as well as captain marvels personality in the movie is dry and un appealing i wanted to give this movie a chance but it failed me
Mar 24 2019,negative,the cgi was decent but its lacking creativity as the story goes and the movie is trying too hard to tell people that shes an empowered female character rather than simply showing it so dont waste your time with this because alita is better
Mar 24 2019,positive,pretty good film not great but worth it
Mar 24 2019,negative,i watch all mcu movies and generally look for them to be fun and decent ive never expected any of them to be great numerous moments sitting in this movie it felt like someone was throwing propaganda at me call me a nut but i dont like that for entertainment i love strong female characters but show me an individual with a challenge to overcome that makes them learn and grow in her next movie dont make her so perfect and arrogant simply my opinion
Mar 24 2019,positive,enjoyable however not memorable almost felt like this one was quickly made to ensure avengers  endgame could finish with a bang think it should have been shown prior to some of the other movies in the sequence of events     story line a little too simple in the grand scheme of the marvel word stocking filler
Mar 24 2019,negative,one of the most dry marvel movies i have ever seen however this might just be me getting tired of the same old marvel formula
Mar 24 2019,negative,very cliche american movie the only redeeming quality is the gender equality value
Mar 24 2019,negative,larson was a horrible choice for this role fell flat with every attempt at humor thank god for nick fury
Mar 24 2019,negative,how many more audience reviews is rt going to delete this movie was terrible the cat was the best thing about it
Mar 24 2019,negative,movie takes place in the 90s and is a lot like the medicore 90s comic book movies as well
Mar 24 2019,negative,stale boring and not the typical quality marvel fare
Mar 24 2019,negative,i really wish i wouldve just listen to my friends and just want for avengers end game i wish i could get my money back shame on me 
Mar 24 2019,negative,overall disappointing for a marvel movie lacks depth and i didnt feel for any of the characters as much as i hoped feels like they lacked effort when putting the movie together there was some good parts but also bad ones too brie larson was not a good match to play captain marvel
Mar 24 2019,negative,definitely one of the weaker of the movies
Mar 24 2019,positive,we liked this movie it was fun with lots of action and the plot was good
Mar 24 2019,positive,this really helps complete the marvel story before the next avengers my only confusion is where the tesoract end up at the end because in the end of captain america he was found with it are there more than 1 otherwise it was fun and great
Mar 24 2019,neutral,not the strongest film in phase 3
Mar 24 2019,negative,boring generic feminist garbage they made nick fury look like a punk liar and idiot to make captain marvel more significant 
Mar 24 2019,negative,subpar trite and boring
Mar 24 2019,positive,very good movie ive watched this movie 2 times the cat is a hero 
Mar 24 2019,positive,one of my favorite movies from the past few years the female lead is outstanding i just went with my family since my children and husband like the super hero movies i was very pleasantly surprised
Mar 24 2019,neutral,you shouldnt love this movie purely just because its a strong female lead nor should you hate the movie for that same reason  just watch it like you would any other movie  first the good things i enjoyed were jude law and sam jackson  jude law is a fantastic actor who i am very happy to see in the mcu and makes for an engaging character  the cgi effects to deage sam jackson with the exception of the very first scene with him are just absolutely incredible to where you dont notice at all even if you were looking for it like i was  the beginning of the movie was really good and it turned out to be a fun time but it was really sloppy  i dont know why brie larson just didnt fit into this role but she just came off as very tired  this is not against her being a stoic woman  dc did this perfectly with wonder woman where she is stoic but a fantastic and lovable character alita is also serious and strong but is so much more enjoyable as a character  brie larson just doesnt fit  the dialogue is sophomoric and clunky and the story didnt really justify for me why shes more powerful than the rest  thor took a dying star to the chest and was fine and she blasted some people with her photon blasters and i failed to be at that point in the theater where i thought now this is who i want to beat thanos if shes the one that kills thanos i will be very disappointed   the joke near the end that is now canon is so stupid that it honestly ruins a lot of the movie for me  its like luke throwing his lightsaber for a laugh but it ruins so much of his character this moment does just that as i will never be able to see certain characters the same again
Mar 24 2019,negative,it is not worth your time after watching infinity war you can say this had 0 wow effect
Mar 24 2019,positive,agreed the character was lackluster in the beginning to not believable at the end unfortunately i feel brie larsons acting abilities are marginalized against the fact that she wears the wardrobe extremely well yes thats a circuitous compliment that acknowledges she is attractive as well as talented
Mar 24 2019,positive,its interesting sitting in a mixed audience of 18  60 yr olds im 72 and still love the franchise finally found out how
Mar 24 2019,positive,everything about the movie was great but how she ganed her super power lacks realism
Mar 24 2019,positive, not what i expected
Mar 24 2019,positive,fun different and breaks away from the same formula weve seen from marvel for many many years just a good time
Mar 24 2019,positive,captain marvel was meant to be a water divider in the marvel universe but its just an ordinary movie the new heroine that came to be a differential in endless war and leading the hero troop is not exciting but there are cool things with a script of origin which is not boring it is even fun and uses screen resources to tell its story full of acid criticism the position of the woman but the script presents controversial to the already established universe of marvel show important events that we had not yet seen in movies silly    brie larsson is not bad at the show but is far from being the great actress who knows samuel jackson is very well the film has a good soundtrack a common direction great costumes and makeup    captain marvel is not a bad movie it behaves in a way that is similar to everything weve seen about marvel so always follow the same recipe no more or no more 610
Mar 24 2019,positive,great movie dont see why there was so many negative reviews definitely recommend seeing it 
Mar 24 2019,negative,very underwhelming it was all over the place had no character development and a stupid ending way to make womens empowerment looks stupid
Mar 24 2019,positive,fun addition to the canon  dont overthink it  it answers some long held questions and sets up the next  its a perfect cinematic rendition of a comic book
Mar 24 2019,neutral,putting aside all the political reasons why people feel like this movie should be infallible and pointing out that yes i am indeed a woman not an angry white man who seem to be the only ones allowed to criticize this film i will give my honest opinion it was just ok the plot was good the action and effects were good samuel jackson was incredible as usual  brie she has the emotional range of a phone box in this movie which is ironic because her character keeps being told to control her emotions what emotions exactly snark anger and wit she has those in spades this is very disappointing to me because i would love to have another female superhero thats relatable that i can look up to for a reference on how this is done well see the cws supergirl carol danvers just was not relatable at all and yet people treat her like she can do no wrong why for politics  im not here for politics im here for a good superhero movie i got an ok one
Mar 24 2019,positive,not marvels best but above average  the girl power is strong with this one
Mar 24 2019,positive,the movie is very interesting not sure why the ratings are so low 
Mar 24 2019,negative,larsens acting was very bland and lacked emotion i never felt connected to her character she had a few moments where she was likeable but she was mostly over confident and stand offish the movie itself had some good points to it the story as a whole was not bad however the character becomes way too powerful i just hope they show that she has a weakness and is not just going to come in and kick a the movie as a whole felt very shoehorned into the mcu 
Mar 24 2019,negative,boring and unimaginative definitely not  worth seeing in the theater for the money maybe its worth catching  it on redbox  when the internet goes down and there is nothing else on tv    the theater was very empty 5 people at best in the early sowing but my friend at the theater was saying all the showings were sold out hmmmm wonder if disney is buying up the empty seats to pad the numbers to hide what an absolute stinker this movie is
Mar 24 2019,negative,im a big fan of brie larson but this film doesnt capture her as much as her other films    if you want to watch a strong female superhero i suggest you watch wonder woman which has also a strong onscreen talent as well as behind
Mar 24 2019,negative,a super flawed marvel movie that try too hard to be what wonder woman was for dc films the central characters feel lost brie larson only shines with her superpower especial effects not for her acting in this movie  which only means one thing she was bad directed in this movie    a movie that we actually dont needed it it was meant to be made this bad just to be made
Mar 24 2019,positive,despite the reviews i actually really liked this movie it reminded me a lot of the venom movie from 2018 samuel l jackson especially did a great job as nick fury the best part of the movie was goose the cat
Mar 24 2019,positive,great movie in so many ways my son daughter wife and i all loved it well done captain
Mar 24 2019,positive,another instant classic  pay no attention to the haters
Mar 24 2019,negative,i was so disappointed i think they have the wrong actress her acting sucked  jokes sucked and it dragged samuel l jackson with the cat and the special effects was the only good thing about this movie wouldnt see it again ever
Mar 24 2019,positive,one of the best marvel movies and awesome soundtrack
Mar 24 2019,positive,it took me a while to get into the film but once i did i really enjoyed it samuel l jackson ben mendelsohn  and jude law were good in their supporting roles i was a little disappointed in brie larson though she still put in a good enough turn the jokes were good and the plot was told well not perfect but enjoyable
Mar 24 2019,positive,the visual effects were spectacular however theres no character arc its very predictable and the protagonist doesnt really go through any personal conflict theres no growth nothing that pays off
Mar 24 2019,negative,very boring i kept looking for it to end and she was bad in this movie her acting was just blah no depth to her character at all
Mar 24 2019,positive,absolutely amazing movie i loved it recommend to everyone
Mar 24 2019,positive,super fun energetic movie with some great 90s nostalgia 
Mar 24 2019,positive,a well made film that draws the audience in  the actors and writing truly shine in this installment of the mcu
Mar 24 2019,positive,captain marvel was an amazing movie the beginning was slow but the rest of it was amazing the tribute at the beginning made me cry on the inside to be honest stan lee is missed dearly
Mar 24 2019,positive,i absolutely love it it is my favorite marvel movie so far  it is hilarious and welltimed it reminds me a bit of guardians of the galaxyâtms sense of humor
Mar 24 2019,negative,cliche nothing very special about it
Mar 24 2019,negative,so of course modern feminism means that a female super hero can be flawed or have weaknesses combine that with bad acting and you have a rather boring main character sure wish marvel would take a lesson from jessica jones the movie was saved by the supporting actors     seriously the final battle wasnt even a contest would have been more interesting if she had felt the need to prove herself to her old mentor weak she flawed yes but interesting at least     but why make a movie interesting why you can instead make it meets too    yawn
Mar 24 2019,positive,a littloe long and not quite the grvitas or the other marvel movies still very good nd gave a much needed back story on fury
Mar 24 2019,positive,lots of unexpected twist and turns 
Mar 24 2019,negative,it does not worth the tickets wheress the emotion e caracter development where is the magic in this film just a marvel signal of its power enterprise
Mar 24 2019,negative,the worst mcu movie ever seen stupid humor a nick fury ridiculed in favor of making captain marvel bigger by force a horrible change of argument where the skrull are now good squandering a fearsome villain for the mcu a protagonist with total lack of charisma and without a reasonable explanation why they make it so unnecessarily powerful removing all possibility of a worthy rival they make her strong because yes without really connecting the audience with her story you can see the forced feminism it is insulting to the intelligence if we take into account the expectations generated with this film and the disappointment is even greater when a fan watches the movie expecting a reasonable coherence like that achieved by the other mcu movies
Mar 24 2019,positive,this is a great movie it is great personally i like it much more than the marvel movies in the past other than thor ragnarok its right up there next to it would recommend you to watch it
Mar 24 2019,positive,love this movie  much better than expected
Mar 24 2019,positive,2nd act moves at way too fast of a pace just to wrap up the movie 
Mar 24 2019,positive,it was surprisingly pretty good i went into it thinking it wasnt going to be that great with all the reviews i read but i was pleasantly surprised brie larson did a good job it was more fun than i thought it would be not perfect but then again what movie is overall a good marvel action movie
Mar 24 2019,negative,this could have been a great movie but it needed more heart among other things better direction maybe
Mar 24 2019,positive,captain marvels a superhero origin movie done right the score is great the characters are all pretty likable and its comfortable enough being a femaleled superhero movie that it doesnt feel the need to shove look at how empowered our female lead is in the audiences face every ten seconds the plot feels sort of like a blend between superman and memento and while thats not a combination i would have thought would blend well together it really does    an excellent film with an excellent soundtrack
Mar 24 2019,positive,good story good character development appropriate humor bottom line really enjoyed this movie
Mar 24 2019,positive,absolutely loved it went to see it saturday night took the kids sunday to see it as well carol is awesome and kicks major butt and i love her snarky attitude she does what is right and finds her inner strength she never gives up she always gets up when she is knocked down    would absolutely recommend
Mar 24 2019,positive,i really enjoyed this movie i laughed a lot and the plot surprised me tremendously recommended
Mar 24 2019,positive,came into it with low expectations from what i had heard however i was pleasantly surprised by it and quite enjoyed it i had heard about the lack of action during the film i thought the film had a lot of action throughout and the parts which arent deemed as action gave a lot of context not all of it being much needed context but context nethertheless the humour was a let down but humour is subjective to preferenceopinion so we all may see it differently
Mar 24 2019,positive,captain marvel was filled with action comedy and drama all fit perfectly together setting up a new future of marvel superheroes
Mar 24 2019,negative,the supporting cast in this does a great job but the writing and acting of the main character brings what could be a good movie down to subpar in 2019 main character has no complexity or growth a flat performance one scene where she was repeating the same line over and over we laughed out loud because it was so flat was that part of the movie or the director trying to get some genuine emotion     i hope endgame doesnt suffer from a forced and too much screen presence from this flat generic superhero
Mar 24 2019,positive,awesome superhero action drama and comedy this time the main character is already a reallife hero before they gain their superpowers but they have to break free from mind control first    the story has fresh twists with scifi and spy thriller elements everyone has their moment to shine and their are characters from past marvel movies that make surprise appearances cool visual effects and excellent music a must see for superhero fans and it does tie in to the avengers in several ways
Mar 24 2019,positive,this is my favorite movie eveeer i love comics and captain marvel inspires me so much i hope they do more movies with womens as leads like that
Mar 24 2019,neutral,edit changing my review as i wrote this as a child who knew little about films its the same old marvel movies nothing special although it uses a nirvana song so thats cool     original captain marvel is a great marvel movie one of the best movies marvel has done in sometime while thor ragnarok is good id compare this movie to be up there the comedy in this movie is just right they arent trying too hard to get a joke across to the audience this movie is worth all the pennies it got
Mar 24 2019,neutral,good plot but the lead actress ruined the movie
Mar 24 2019,positive,its okay but not the best marvel movie
Mar 24 2019,negative,took my family to go watch this movie it was horrible boring my wife fell asleep watching it the only saving grace was the stupid cat and then that was ruined
Mar 24 2019,neutral,the movie was so boring i was asleep through the movie the heroine was too powerful
Mar 24 2019,positive,really enjoyed this i dont know what people were complaining about i went to the movie expecting larson to be wooden but i thought she was great
Mar 24 2019,positive,good story good characters fun
Mar 24 2019,positive,one of the best marvel movie
Mar 24 2019,positive,captain marvel is amazing ill be honest brie larson did not look like she could play the part but i was wronggreat edition to the mcu great origin story visuals are amazing and we finally find out what happened to furys eye a must watch
Mar 24 2019,negative,so slooooow corny jokestook too long to get to the point and to any good action there was maybe 10 minutes of good watchable action the whole time i was just thinking when the hell is this going to get better and when it was evident that wasnt going to happen i just wanted it to be over
Mar 24 2019,positive,its a good movie with nice visuals and funny jokes 
Mar 24 2019,negative,one of the most mediocre marvel films so far definitely on the low tier of the mcu it suffers from having a dry and bland protagonist who doesnt seem to find her exact fit throughout the movie plot is weak and has certain points that make no sense or appear to be empty she doesnt age from the 1990s to endgame which is a bit strange the change from having carol danvers origins as captain marvel robs her of character development and evolution that would have been better for its feminist undertones if she would have progressed from ms marvel to captain marvel the twist with the skrulls being hunted refugees was welcomed fury and goose brought some humor and entertainment ben mendelhson as talos was enjoyable the stan lee intro and cameo were incredible nostalgic and convey a great sense of respect for the man that started it all
Mar 24 2019,neutral,this film tries extremely hard to be a powerful female driven statement on rising up when knocked down that it fails because it neglects to emphasize the randomly inserted scenes of our heroine as a youngster getting knocked down and rising up and only makes you realize that this is one of the themes when a montage of all these scenes are put together at the end of the film until then its a comic book film that delivers sparse action and an extremely weak villain played by jude law how can you care about the lead when the entire film is of the lead searching for who she is wonder woman knew who she was and we felt it often her passion for love life and the preservation of it at any cost captain marvel wants nothing more than to find out who she is that is boring captain marvel is a predictable clichï 12 c that offers nothing in the way of female empowerment and offers nothing new to the marvel universe so she is a human who got her powers from a light speed engine that blew up and she absorbed its energy this is suppose to help defeat thanos hmm unless she was special in the way star lord is and we just dont know it yet a very disappointing effort from marvel almost as bad as doctor strange
Mar 24 2019,positive,it was a great movie it has its faults but doesnt deserve all the nasty things that are being said had quite a funny moments action is fantastic and shes a likeble character
Mar 24 2019,positive,a solid origin story for marvel studios newest face the story becomes more interesting as it progresses looking forward to seeing where the character goes from here
Mar 24 2019,positive,for the first 30 minutes i kept finding myself not being very interested in the movie or story after the scene with all of them in the house is when i finally felt completely entertained overall i would say a 75 i just wish the begging would have been a little more entertaining
Mar 24 2019,negative,only ok  one of the more forgettable character introductions into the mcu  would have been a better movie with a different actress  brie was either unable or was scripted to be very very nonexpressive and unemotional  and how she gets her powers is briefly shown and not really explained  certainly not how powerful she supposedly becomes  if this is the direction of the mcu after disneyficatiion then im off the bandwagonafter end game  ill be done with mcu and the dc universe is starting to look a like a lot more fun to me  diversity over substance  forget you
Mar 24 2019,positive,good concept but somewhere after the story board it all went wrong  hard to say if the script sucked or brie larson was terriblebut one of the 2 happened  it was boring at times but also had its moments  probably just getting bored of the same old marvel formula
Mar 24 2019,positive,absolutely a blast so fun and entertaining brie larson killed it as the role of captain marvel
Mar 24 2019,positive,itâtms one of the weaker marvel movies didnâtmt feel special but i liked the effects and the finally and it had the best stan lee cameo so all in all not that bad but not all that great
Mar 24 2019,positive,one of my top 5 favorite marvel movies    spoilers below     brie larson does a good job playing a character with two different sets of memories and her true personality is reigned in by her kree teachings despite the villain himself being a twist i think what helped sell it was the previous villain up until then was actually a sympathetic character gone to extremes for a noble goal
Mar 24 2019,positive,i actually really liked this movie even though i heard bad things about it
Mar 24 2019,positive,i think this is a film that has something to say about feminism and colonialism and says about as much as you can get away with when youre making a bigbudget hollywood movie people tried to downvote it before theyd even seen it which tells you everything about them
Mar 24 2019,negative,the most slow moving lack luster and has the acting skill of a movie from the sixties dont wast your time watching this fan flick
Mar 24 2019,negative,embarassing never during the vision i have ever felt captain marvel threatened by some kind of nemesis boring and stupid this movie puts marvel in shame
Mar 24 2019,negative,this was terrible and brelarson acting was just rubbish do not watch this film
Mar 24 2019,neutral,decided to watch it it wasnt good nor bad just was
Mar 24 2019,negative,a drop in quality compared to the latest studio releases
Mar 24 2019,negative,the movie had very little character development when comparing them to the other main characters in the marvel franchise as if it was put together at the last second as a after thought
Mar 24 2019,positive,it was possibly my favorite of the marvel movies and i love the character is a strong female character very well done
Mar 24 2019,positive,an excellent origin story this movie does its job it shows us carol danvers personality and growth as she discovers herself by rediscovering her past balances comedy and serious moments perfectly cant wait to see her in endgame
Mar 24 2019,positive,amazing a must watch super hero movie
Mar 24 2019,negative,this is easily the worst marvel movie ive seen since dolph lundgrens punisher or ben aflflecks daredevil  a boring story led by a weak actor rescued only by the supporting cast and some humorous inside jokes
Mar 24 2019,negative,jackson a larson acted well but the lack of any competitive villain or any mortal danger to the heroine made the storyline much less engaging than i would have hoped
Mar 24 2019,negative,doesnt fit in with the avengers movies the script isnt witty like the guardians or thor movies tries to be too awesome too soon cgi and costumes arent the best
Mar 24 2019,positive,this movie is more than just an origin story for captain marvel with an all mighty foe it shows that wars are often based on something we believe to be true that turned out to be a fabricated lie it shows us a hero that learns from their mistakes takes accountability and tries to make up for their wrongdoings  this movie is not perfect but some critics seems to be based on the fact that certain traits of carol danvers were not explicitly told or explored however there is enough that can be read between the lines and directors should be able to rely on their audience to do just that movies are visual and to get the message one should try to connect the audio with the visual
Mar 24 2019,negative,so boring lot of people walked out and most fell asleep on it bad movie 
Mar 24 2019,negative,the story was boring and had no interesting characters including captain marvel the acting from bri larson gives her worst performance and i had high hopes for this movie but marvel truly let me down 
Mar 24 2019,positive,awesomeï 14love action scenesï 14
Mar 24 2019,negative,i thought it was ok not something i would want to see again or add to my blu ray collection
Mar 24 2019,positive,spoilers for captain marvel  a fun marvel movie pretty much just an average mcu film which is good because the mcu is incredible with one major problem i love how the movie added a lot of depth to nick furys character i didnt really like how goose scratched his eye and thats why nick has an eyepatch but other than that nick fury was a kind of over serious boring character i liked how 90s it was but i didnt like space in this movie i think a lot of marvel movies have really poor surroundings in space or anywhere else really guardians of the galaxy thor the dark world guardians 2 was amazing though but it just felt so good to be on earth i watched this movie in cinemas because i thought id need to know it to understand endgame but nope didnt really have much connection apart from the first aftercredit scene but the really big probem the skrulls skrulls are meant to bad guys they would be amazing villains and an amazing addition to the mcu but they just ruined it and it wasnt even original the good guys are the bad guys and the bad guys are the good guys so this halfruined the movie for me that and how it went fun boring fun boring the best part of the movie the opening logo enough said
Mar 24 2019,positive,good movie a little slow on middle actress did well 
Mar 24 2019,negative,dissapointed by larsons play    fury was decent in this movie   huge plot holes scrolls and marvels cgi not so good and nothing super specialunique   script and dialogues 510   not the best marvel movie
Mar 24 2019,negative,by far the least interesting marvel movie
Mar 24 2019,positive,i absolutely loved this movie i spent a really good time amazing visual effects worth watching in imax really funny lots of action and super good music from the 90s 
Mar 24 2019,negative,can i rate it lower than half a star please  blandest protagonist ever never struggled in the whole damn movie never grew as a character and never did any actual acting you dont even need to bash this movie for its feminist propaganda which only served as a means to popularize the weak character and to reinforce all bad stereotypes normally associated with feminism it does nothing for women captain marvels enemies do not present any challenge to be overcome tension in this movie is nonexistent and humor doesnt land 90  of the time  its cringy as hell     all in all  nobody wanted this in the way it was presented for some reason disneymarvel thought it a good idea to make a lot of noise about how inspiring this movie will be for women and fail marvelously
Mar 24 2019,neutral,quite average not as good as i was expecting
Mar 24 2019,positive,omg this movie is sooo good  everything was just perfect music picture story  brie larson and jude law are hot as hell btw
Mar 24 2019,positive,great movie super funny and awesome 90s music bad reviews from political haters important to watch before end game
Mar 24 2019,positive,while its not a perfect movie captain marvel is still a fun watch found myself repeatedly laughing and enjoying everyone especially samuel l jackson and brie larson marvel really outdid themselves with some of the special effects here
Mar 24 2019,positive,not sure what the bad review business is coming from one of the best movies ive seen just go watch it
Mar 24 2019,negative,didnt really like it parts were ok but ive never been a fan of the character and this story and actress werent the best could have been a better movie with a tighter plot and a better actress kinda made a joke out of nick furys origin and character 
Mar 24 2019,positive,captain marvel is the latest installment in the marvel cinematic universe with it being 21st film in the longgoing franchise it is nice to see that this movies makes some much needed tweaking to the mcu formula captain marvel played by brie larson is stuck on planet earth in the mid 1990s yikes stranded on earth with evil kree on her tail earthling nick fury played by samuel l jackson helps captain marvel navigate across earth in hopes of finding a powerful engine before the kree do     mostly jammed packed with jokes and good action captain marvel succeeds at maintaining a good balance while also sending a positive message about never letting someone keep you down
Mar 24 2019,positive,another great addition for marvel 
Mar 24 2019,positive,i enjoyed the movie was entertained and wanted to watch more when it ended ill use my flex time and go see it again whenif there is a slow day at workgreat movie to see in theaters and will be nice to watch at home if you have good a speaker system  i also got even more excited for a4
Mar 24 2019,positive,a marvel movie that brought some good diversity to the marvel franchise a mostly entertaining movie with a few flat spots in amongst all the action not exactly cannon which may upset the those with a hard core comic background but no movies in the marvel universe stick to the comics anyway let go of that or any political presumptions you may have and just enjoy it for what it is brie does a good job here and whilst in my opinion not quite as good as wonder woman and infinity war still rates as my favourite marvel movie i do think this was better than black panther and ragnorok a family favourite with both sons and daughters agreeing that this was one of marvels best
Mar 24 2019,negative,this is what an oscar winners acting performance looks like bland and plain facial expressions with the athletic ability of a potato marvels first social justice fiasco and hopefully the last dont waste your time folks stay at home
Mar 24 2019,negative,having seen all the mcu movies leading up to this one i was really hoping for a good movie this movie felt forced on the audience for humor and connecting with carol danvers brie larsons acting was horrible it was truly tough to watch gal gadots in wonder woman acting puts captain marvels to shame  save your money and go see shazam
Mar 24 2019,positive,no the best marvel movie but certainly not the the worst enjoyable but ultimately forgettable
Mar 24 2019,positive,the film was good not great but with amazing moments marvel films are very formulaic i guess i was expecting more from the new phase of marvel movies with captain marvel leading the charge unfortunately thats not what i got brie larsons acting was also very bland the other characters were probably the best part of the movie goose the cat had more emotion than she showed throughout that whole movie her relationship with jackson was a highlight reminiscent of the doctor and donna talostelos was fun to watch the movie really doesnt pick up until the third act having good action hopefully her character gets better as the movies flesh her out a bit more 
Mar 24 2019,positive,great movie so much great stuff and a nice throw back to the 90s the action scenes where great the story was good just great to see a marvel movie that could tell the story and throw in a bunch of cameos from other marvel characters 
Mar 23 2019,negative,it was just okay  very phase one  the good moments were provided by almost entirely by slj and the other supporting cast    the plus her friend from her flying days and the talk her daughter gives her about setting an example the cat the indiana jones moment    the cons the movie was so predictable the graphics budget ran out and the action looked like a ps1 cut scene    it wasnt bad it was fun to see in theaters for spectacle but i get the feeling that drumming up controversy is the new way to get butts in seats when a studio knows their film is just okay    oh and heartshaped box came out after carol disappeared      lazy writing    that said    i want to see this as a setup to get carol out of the way so we could have monica rambeau as captain marvel the original female captain marvel and also the little girl in the movie andor kamala khan ms marvel      it just feels like filler
Mar 23 2019,negative,boring and predictable with cliched characters and story be good when this superhero francht era is over and we can have some decent movies again good music and a few good jokes tho
Mar 23 2019,neutral,i was very disappointedthat is all i will say in regards
Mar 23 2019,negative,major characters replaced with females to fulfill a narrative nobody cares a about rotten tomatoes cant hide their bs  by deleting everyone they dont like here either this movie will go down as the worst mcu movie in history
Mar 23 2019,positive,great fun not a fan of her mohawk but i cant wait to see her in end game
Mar 23 2019,positive,a new captain arrives
Mar 23 2019,negative,this is easily the worst marvel movie and that includes the mess that eas thor the dark world    captain marvel feels like a movie that marvel was obligated to make but didnâtmt want to the story is winding and often senseless with robotic dialogue and jokes that fall flat there is no chemistry between fury and marvel so we are subjected to forced humour that drags on endlessly without forwarding the plot     quick notes    the action was not cohesive and not paced properly to keep the audience engaged   it supposed to build up to this big climax where she goes binary but we donâtmt get let in on the how or why until the last minute   bad guys will stand staring at her waiting to get shot or eaten by aliens  the director did not bother to try to explain how veers could have lived for six years as a kree without trying to figure out why she forgot her entire past  they could not get the actor that played ronan back so they found a talking mannequin that had never acted before to fill in just cgi him  why was there an alien super death cat just hanging around the base  how did the skrulls know that veers would be the one to go in for their big trap and how did they even know her past would lead them to their families    so many problems and not enough fun to make up for it     better to just skip this one it can go on the shelf next to dark world and the hulk
Mar 23 2019,neutral, captain marve movie story not so interesting
Mar 23 2019,negative,huge marvel fan and overall disappointed  brie larson was incredible but the scripting and character development could have been better  the foley was also terrible  it sounded like everyone was at least 600 lbs stomping around like the fx guy was new   brie could have had more dialogue to further showcase her personality  im not sure what all the hype is about perhaps all the deleted reviews werent trolls  overall id rate this as a low average marvel film  nothing id look forward to seeing a sequel for but wouldnt pass it up  im excited to see her in avengers endgame i only hope the director and writers will do a better job
Mar 23 2019,positive,fun movie larson was good as captain marvel really felt like this was a filter movie before the big oneendgame
Mar 23 2019,positive,great fun my son and i enjoyed it very much the stan lee opening was wonderful and kinda gave me goose bumps we love the marvel movies and are looking forward to end game
Mar 23 2019,negative,a below average marvel movie painfully predictable film with occasionally good laughs
Mar 23 2019,positive,strictly a c movie and i loved ww the plot made the hero blandvery few jokes hit home the main action sequence outside the song was confusing and a let down i feel most pple are going only because of end game
Mar 23 2019,negative,no purpose being in the marvel universe 
Mar 23 2019,negative,i made an account to warn people how terrible this is terrible character development horrible storyline bad soundtrack and costumes complete trash
Mar 23 2019,positive,i really like the movie a must see movie fun and entertaining
Mar 23 2019,negative,theres really nothing special about captain marvel it seems as if the mcu quickly whipped together a half baked hero who is badly developed and by the end of the film you have no feeling for her the writing is bland the jokes are outdated but it still has some charm one scene in particular at the end brought a smile to my face but regardless captain marvel is a let down
Mar 23 2019,positive,loved it not quite as much as wonder a woman but a good flick
Mar 23 2019,negative,im a big supporter in strong female leads heroes in front of the camera and behind it i love brie larson in other films but it seems like she was trying so hard to channel robert downey jrs iron man in this and although there a brief moments of ms larson its not enough to make up for it this origin story is brisk but isnt as interesting the twist wasnt really shocking unfortunately dcs wonder woman is a better counterpart if you are looking for a strong female hero
Mar 23 2019,positive,my second favorite mcu movie  great cast  great fight scenes  the character development is on point  i liked the pacing and how they took you through carols past life wo it feeling unnatural    9510
Mar 23 2019,negative,could have been a much better movie without all the feminist overtones wasted no time we all have obsticles and endure heartbreak yes there are evil people in the world its not a gender thing ive also never seen a character as powerful as they made her quite ridiculous actually lots of plot holes
Mar 23 2019,positive,a fun marvel movie that is far from their worst but certainly not their best plenty of good times here from a younged up nick fury and agent coulson a charismatic yet slightly sinister jude law and finally to the shapeshifting enigmatic skrulls brisk not overly laden with exposition action packed and fairly earnest i feel that the worst transgression by far was what seemed to me anyway the attempt to mimic the humor and musicality of guardians of the galaxy that felt like the least genuine part of the movie for me its not that the jokes or the music were bad they just felt like too much of an obvious grab for the gotg vibe despite this minor complaint i enjoyed the movie a friend of mine points out however that now captain marvel has become so powerful that shell have the classic superman problem aka too strong to write anything compelling well i still like superman a lot and ive read and watched plenty of compelling stories about him so i dont think it is that big of a deal also kudos to marvel for finally getting a female led project out the door also a wag of the finger for not doing it sooner
Mar 23 2019,neutral,thought the history was kinda lacking and felt a little touch of unecessary politics not as much as i thought but still some character were funny and interesting but for the story there were a lot of gaps and too many clichã cs
Mar 23 2019,positive,dont give in to people saying the movie is trash see it for yourself the trailers show nothing to how amazing the movie really is ill tell you right now that it is amazing even for nonsuperhero fans
Mar 23 2019,positive,it is good but it is not nearly as good as some of the other marvel movies still worth seeing on the big screen
Mar 23 2019,positive,loved it want to buy it cannot wait to see it again
Mar 23 2019,positive,magical and very atractive captain marvel breaks all the bad comments with their original and true face about what is it wrong or god
Mar 23 2019,neutral,apart from the overhyped 90s veneer the movie was uninteresting it ranks on the low end of marvel films i was checking my watch 90 minutes into the film due in no small part to the staggering lack of enthusiasm brie larson put into her role as carol danvers her performance and the films writing lacked heart no amount of marvel nostalgia or impressive action sequences could fill that emotional void even the villain underwhelmed but i have to hand it to carol she kicks some serious alien butt she is the most overpowered hero yet in the mcu nothing can stand in her way and by the end of the movie she knows it i for one was just hoping for more in the words of captain marvel herself ive got nothing to prove to you butcould you at least have tried
Mar 23 2019,positive,great movie there was a plot good villians and awesome action so much better than anticipated and actually has me excited for avengers which i was planning on skipping
Mar 23 2019,positive,amazing movie great plotline and fabulous performance one of my favourite marvel movies and definitely my favourite marvel hero
Mar 23 2019,positive,donâtmt listen to the haters this movie is awesome  led by a awesome leading lady
Mar 23 2019,positive,beginning was slow not bad
Mar 23 2019,positive,enjoyable movie but i didnt care for the way the origin story developed  however the storyline had a better  connection for me the second time around
Mar 23 2019,positive,a solid origin story the pacing is different than the sequels and teamups weve seen for the last five years not as funny but interesting all the same this may surprise some mcu fans but it fits in well and sheds some light on the mcu future 
Mar 23 2019,positive,another outstanding marvel movie my 10 year old daughter cant stop talking about it and thats what a comic book movie is supposed to be about
Mar 23 2019,neutral,could have chosen a better person to play captain marvel
Mar 23 2019,positive,i like the changes made to canon lets face it some of those are antiquated and silly  though i question the point of the change to mar vell  i didnt care for the flatness of carols portrayal on earth  it felt as if she was being filmed in a sound booth with no connection to anyone  it robbed the climax of real emotional payoff  and the kree were left as a cliffhangerin a movie that takes place years ago who made that decision feels like more mistakes like age of ultron made  too much setup not enough focus on this story      i did love seeing monica rambeau and the cat was awesome  i am sad that brie larsen couldnt do scenes with the cat   wished we could have gotten more time with one of the many stories in this film skrulls but they were all flashed through in order to get through the listed plot points
Mar 23 2019,positive,sadly this movies reviews are ruined by politics as many things are these days i dont agree with the stances bri larson took and yet i still thouroughly enjoyed this movie the storyline was engaging and it was very uplifting i think this was a great addition to the marvel cinematic universe
Mar 23 2019,negative,they made a lot of mistakes i didnt enjoy it neither did my wife
Mar 23 2019,positive,super good movie good character development a great plot and a twist that was totally unexpected very well thought out for a marvel movie some may say that the brie larsons performance was stale but i disagreeit was very in character for what was going on in the movie would highly recommend
Mar 23 2019,negative,it wasnt a bad film was below average i never got the sense of struggle which is no different to superman which i find very boring and brie larsons performance was forgetable but i found that an earth aircraft can withstand laser fire but alien ships cannot withstand bullets yeah right if marvel wasnt pushing for this policitical agenda and concentrate on a good story then it probably would have been better
Mar 23 2019,positive,my girlfriend thinks shes captain marvel now 
Mar 23 2019,positive,im a dc fan and i thought this movie was way better then wonder woman the cast and story were great i was glued to the screen the entire movie 
Mar 23 2019,positive,amazing movie brie larson is wonderful and samuel l jackson was hilarious cant wait to see for of captain marvel
Mar 23 2019,negative,really terrible movie  i thought it was a joke when i saw the first trailer honestly  a horrible idea executed as poorly as humanly possible  iâtmm really dissapointed in marvel  probably wont go to theaters for another one of their movies
Mar 23 2019,positive,brie larson nails it constantly amazed how well marvel does casting rdj evans and now larson great action great pacing and great themes on multiple levels one of marvels best loved the zig instead of zag in the plot
Mar 23 2019,negative,i really wanted to like this film but it wasnt good just because it is a marvel movie doesnt mean we should automatically love it
Mar 23 2019,neutral,so much potential so much
Mar 23 2019,positive,i think this is among the best marvel movies yet im so glad they can just keep getting it better and better 
Mar 23 2019,positive,captain marvel is a fun fast paced rockin good time at the movies with a villain twist thatâtms a breath of fresh air and a protagonist that can rival any of the male heroâtms that came before and a soundtrack that gives guardians of the galaxy a run for its money definitely one of my favorite marvel films to date right behind avengers guardians and captain america
Mar 23 2019,positive,i think its a good movie it is necessary to emphasize that the first minutes of the film the performance of the protagonist is not the best but i think that in script and production is a very good movie on the other hand some funny or sound editing scenes were forced especially at the end of the movie
Mar 23 2019,positive,a really enjoyable movie that sits in the top 2 or 3 films in the mcu excellent humor and great action storyline is a little convoluted however my 9 year old followed it fine so probably just me some laugh out loud moments and well judged pacing meant that it kept the whole familys attention throughout really looking forward to seeing the character in avengers endgame
Mar 23 2019,positive,this is a fantastic movie that one will only understand with context without context and background knowledge of the marvel universe you wont understand the references
Mar 23 2019,positive,very good movie the script and acting is amazing marvel did a good job on this one
Mar 23 2019,negative,a pretty bland movie boring which for a superhero movie should be pretty tough for a marvel movie it certainly looked cheap
Mar 23 2019,negative,straight garbage   wtf marvel studios some parts of the movie was good but the plot completely suck  and for the main character smh she has no skills as an actor so many other great actors that could have made an amazing captain marvel
Mar 23 2019,positive,loved this origin story for not only captain marvel but fury coulson and shield
Mar 23 2019,positive,marvel once more presents a very entertaining chapter into the marvel universethe stan lee cameo works brilliantly and pays a fitting tribute to the late icon
Mar 23 2019,negative,im very much looking forward to watching avengers end game and have been a huge fan of the mcu through all their movies that being saidthis movie didnt do a good job of passing the torch created by the characters from the original avengers movie to the next generation while i personally think brie larson did as good a job as she could with the subpar script as well as samuel l jackson and other characters her characters major lesson wasnt very relatable in how she didnt struggle with anything i my fiancï 12 ce parents friends really face i was cheering for her more than the villian of the movie which is different from the black panther movie and a quality thats really important in a superhero movie     most of how i felt about this movie is biased im a huge comic book fanatic i know the original storylines from captain marvell  to ms marvel  to nick furys history  to the kreescrull war going into the movie with few expectations but wanting to see the iconic moments and plots from the comics continue in the mcu  and have this movie start off new comic book characters for years to come i was very disappointed again most of the fault was to the writers in my opinion this movie had lots of weight on its shoulders and had to introduce a new character to replace the old favorites  and captain marvel fell under the pressure    all things considered an okay stand alone movie for the casual movie goer but for anyone keeping up with the series this movie is based on  very disappointing
Mar 23 2019,positive,really good i love marvel
Mar 23 2019,neutral,first half was so slow and dull plot was confusing and felt pointless and they could have picked someone to play captain marvel who showed a little more emotion then brie larson no interesting villain either last 10 minutes was very entertaining not the best movie but im glad they introduced a strong female lead into the mcu she will be bada in endgame
Mar 23 2019,positive,very good movie 999 rating for me
Mar 23 2019,positive,this is the first time i have reviewed a movie i felt compelled to set the record straight and tell people the truth this movie is a blast and if some people feel like their manhood is being threatened by a strong woman that is their problem not ours
Mar 23 2019,positive,enjoyable mcu flick but not the top tiersuffers slightly from the same problem as dcs superman in that the fully realised character makes every other superhero superfluous
Mar 23 2019,negative,what a pile of crap nothing new and exciting just bad
Mar 23 2019,positive,it was but not great some of the plot did not make a lot of sense dr strange and black panther were a lot better 
Mar 23 2019,positive,i really enjoyed the movie for what it is iï 12tmd enjoyed brie larson and samuel jackson charisma together thought it was better than other mcu origins and about time ma el caught up to the times women can and do carry a movie
Mar 23 2019,positive,i know absolutely nothing about super heros and i love every minute and cried three times
Mar 23 2019,positive,it almost seems like an mcu phase i origin film and suffers from the same cliche weaknesses however its appealing special effects and buddy interactions between larson and a finely deaged samuel l jackson make the movie pretty entertaining
Mar 23 2019,positive,thereelnesscom behold marvel comic nerds the longawaited captain marvel has arrived starring brie larson as the air force pilot turned super hero caught between warring alien races the krees and the skrulls for their first big blockbuster film directorwriter duo anna boden and ryan fleck have crafted a creative and complex story set in 1995 starting with the alien wars and gradually backing into how larsons carol danvers came to be aligned with the krees the duo weave in a fun hodgepodge of pop tunes and technology throwbacks blockbuster video stores clunky computers and floppy disks from the era and they also cleverly play on moviegoers own preconceptions making for some interesting plot twists with a surprisingly amount of heart there are a lot of fight scenes some pretty impressive but not overused special effects and a solid supporting cast samuel l jackson annette bening lashana lynch ben mendelsohn and jude law that plays well off larson who makes captain marvel the rare superhero film that is not only throughly entertaining but has a relatable lead character a
Mar 23 2019,negative,boring and static storytelling marketed to be the strongest female character to date perhaps they forgot we have wonder womancaptain marvel is a dull character or perhaps just needed an actress to bring more to the rolejust a let down of a movie
Mar 23 2019,positive,captain marvel is a great addition to the mcu it introduces a very strong character captain marvel has a fairly good plot to it there were not very many suprises to me there are some points in captain marvel where it is quite dry and sone scenes that were lacking cgi overall i recomend captain marvel to anyone
Mar 23 2019,positive,yes yes and more yes a powerful strong female lead that empowers and becomes a true hero loved it beautiful origin story and prepped perfectly for endgame but you have to wait for midcredit end scene to see how they connect 
Mar 23 2019,positive,another enjoyable marvel movie that has great action and humor despite a pretty dull performance from brie larson
Mar 23 2019,positive,while watching brie larson as captain marvel the phrase vaguely irritating came to mind  i felt she overplayed the cocky pilot stereotype and found myself wishing lashana lynch has been the main character i could watch her dogfight against the kree character all day and enjoyed her interactions with fury  overall a great movie to take my teen daughter to but to seeing captain marvel again in endgame meh
Mar 23 2019,positive,one of my favorite installments of the mcu i love larson as captian danvers i particularly like that marvel produced a movie about one of the powerful female superheroes
Mar 23 2019,negative,main actress did a terrible job
Mar 23 2019,positive,it was amazing absolutely loved it captain marvel perfectly fits in the mcu and really hypes up avengers endgame brie larson did an amazing job portraying the character and im excited to see more of her i give it a 910
Mar 23 2019,positive,this movie was fun overall  the plot was good with some twists i did not see coming  overarching themes include the enduring impact of female friendship which is not often explored in this genre and the hero story out of all the marvel origin stories this one is one of my favorites  bree larsonï 12tms performance was excellent and she had a good rapport with samuel l jackson
Mar 23 2019,positive,great tie in to the marvel series good storyline like how its more of an empowering women movie and fighter jets its an action packed movie with a twist
Mar 23 2019,positive,ive seen it last night and was extremely satisfied amazing and hilarious love the music theyve used and a glism of her in the next movie hope they will make another movie with her she was made for her role as captain marvel
Mar 23 2019,negative,an absolute horrible and boring movie
Mar 23 2019,negative,was excited to see this but it ended up really boring and badly made reminded me of a superhero tv show
Mar 23 2019,positive,awesome movie that builds on the marvel comic universe
Mar 23 2019,positive,liked it but didnt love it   id put this somewhere in the middle of the marvel films iam looking forward to what they have in store for this character in the future
Mar 23 2019,positive,loved it   its a good movie in its own right and a great lead into endgame
Mar 23 2019,negative,simply bland im an avid marvel fan and i must say im very disappointed id be okay with it if this movie was made in the days of thor or captain america first avenger
Mar 23 2019,positive,its a good movie but could be much better the vilain it too weak
Mar 23 2019,negative,the plot was weak  the mcu timeline is ruined by this movie and the villains were a joke
Mar 23 2019,positive,decent but in the marvel universe a c is a d compared to the other marvel entries this is a rather bland addition to the family almost like that second cousin at thanksgiving and christmas that  you remember only at those events  brie larson has been accused of being wooden but really i  think it is more that she is a consummate smart ass so she has that kind of face  with a more colorful cast she is either going to have to have some great lines or get a lot more personality because she is going to have to pull her weight when she suits up with the avengers heres to hoping there is great cast chemistry with her
Mar 23 2019,positive,itï 12 12tms a good superhero film but for mcu standards it falls short not even in the top fifteen of mcu films
Mar 23 2019,positive,i was honestly surprised about this film i thought it wouldnt be that good as the other marvel films in the past also brie larson did a good job as captain marvel it made this film really enjoyable
Mar 23 2019,positive,fun movie brie larson at cm will go far in the new leg of mcu
Mar 23 2019,positive, great movie overall
Mar 23 2019,positive,its good   
Mar 23 2019,negative,so i am a fan of the mcu and have seen all of the previous films most of them on the big screen and feel very invested in the story and characters it has has bad moments thor dark world and iron man 3 were pretty bad but i have at least enjoyed everything ive seen     that is not the case with captain marvel the character feels empty and lifeless yet just succeeds at everything because reasons the jokes fell flat and the pacing was way off it feels more like a film that was made by committee rather than with the passion that comes through in other works     i am still very excited for endgame but if this is the future for marvel i will not be along for the ride as it is not what i want and i highly doubt that many people do
Mar 23 2019,positive,amazing story but lacked in fight scenes
Mar 23 2019,neutral,this movie can be fun to watch at some points but it just cannonballs you right into the story donâtmt get me wrong there are some great characters in the movie that i found quite intriguing it also had some scenes that made me laugh a couple times overall this movie fails to stand as a memorable marvel blockbuster
Mar 23 2019,negative,one of the weaker marvel movies didnt feel any real connection to the hero
Mar 23 2019,negative,this movie was pure junk no decent story or character development critics who would rate this 78 and rate bohemian rhapsody in the 50 need to reconsider their careers
Mar 23 2019,positive,not marvels best but far from its worst captain marvel brings a different style origin to the table and this refreshing take is entertaining
Mar 23 2019,positive,very happy with the overall product strong female lead with signs of vulnerability which allows the climax of the story to reach higher peaks wasnt as funny as the other marvel films which separates the tone and quickly explains the origin of the character without long overdrawn out story 
Mar 23 2019,positive,dont listen to the hate i went in with low expectations and was so impressed with the movie
Mar 23 2019,neutral,overall it was decent but that is not good enough in the marvel universe brie larson seemed stiff and offered very little emotion other than her constant smirking samuel jackson delivers a solid performance and the action sequencesspecial effects were top notch
Mar 23 2019,negative,terrible dont know why i spent my money on it
Mar 23 2019,negative,very slow story build up
Mar 23 2019,positive,this made me gayer than i already was 
Mar 23 2019,positive,the worlds most popular movie franchise at long last releases its first female led movie one beyond wordscaptain marvel the mcus 21st movie takes us on an intergalactic adventure similar in the vein of some of the franchises best such as guardians of the galaxy and thor ragnarok yet it keeps the premise entirely original featuring oscarlevel talent such as brie larson captain marvel and jude law captain marvel continues the anticipated path set by avengers infinity war creating its own lore and corner within the mcu all while leading us to the final destination that is avengers endgame next april    the movie depicts the neverbefore told story of the kreeskrull war as well as how fury lost his eye being set in the past captain marvel has a great deal of freedom which it fully exploits referencing popular culture movies such as top gun and pulp fiction this makes the movie the blastfromthepast we never even knew we wanted the history of the mcu is greatly broadened while somehow managing to greatly setup the franchises future the movie proves that there are great stories to tell by taking a step back     captain marvel greatly succeeds with one thing that comes with any marvel movie the humour the mid90s setting allows the movie to create humour from infamous elements set in this period recognisable to anyone who lived in the 90s there are no cliche jokes all the humour is enacted through the behaviour of individual characters which are developed extremely well  there are many minor titbits that many fans of the mcu or those who have recently watched particular instalments in the franchise may spot this is mainly accomplished through shared characters  these characters do have large roles in the movie but in no way does the plot rely on their previous appearances one thing millions of fans have been clamoring for ever since marvels the avengers was achieved by captain marvel agent philip j coulson coulson was given a large role in this movie all while not contradicting the 110 episodes of his own show this is a mustsee for fans of the show    the makeup costumes set designs and visual effects are all the best in the game there are very few movies i would rank higher than captain marvel on this basis especially as much of the movie is a spaceepic the action is much better than the majority of blockbuster movies marvel has started to use longer takes for their fight scenes and i think this feature is here to stay seeing the movie in imax 3d i benefitted greatly from all of the above the movie utilises its imax format to the maximum having multiple imax scenes throughout the runtime the majority is shot in imax during these scenes imax viewers are presented with an extra 26 of footage there is no misuse of 3d which many often complain about with other movies while the movie was converted to 3d the 3d conversion is honestly the best ive seen recently i didnt even realise it was converted until i was informed later imax should be your first portofcall  the movie always keeps you on the journey of carol danvers never giving you the greater perspective of the movie until the title character herself discovers it it is an interesting and lucrative concept  a way to diversify the general plots and shy away from any similarities to other movies you are always kept guessing while enticed into the story once the true nature of the movie is revealed you are in for one hell of a ride just make sure you stay behind until the very end of the credits    there is no universe in which i do not highly highly recommend you to see this movie  imax approved
Mar 23 2019,positive,loved the soundtrack loved goode loved how fury lost an eye loved carol when she gets her glow on
Mar 23 2019,positive,amazing movie with amazing effects and stiry
Mar 23 2019,positive,captain marvel was an awesome movie i feel the movie was more of a backstory than its own shining movie i wouldnt of liked this movie so much if it didnt blow my mind of how the avengers started i give my thanks to the director for doing an amazing job with that 
Mar 23 2019,neutral,it was meh wasnt bad but wasnt great the powers looked really cool but the fight choreography was bad the plot had some fun bits but was pretty formulaic brie larson had some great moments as captain marvel but most of her performance was wooden it wasnt the sjw propoganda a lot of trolls made it out to be but a lot of the feminist moments were a little too on the nose like having the guy say you know why its called a cockpit right    not bad by any means but not amazing either just like most of marvels movies just perfectly middling
Mar 23 2019,neutral,choppy fun miscast
Mar 23 2019,neutral,my girlfriend just reminded me that as we left captian marvel our discussion was about trying to find things we liked about it we remarked on just how forced some of the lines seemed we also found one smile in particular humorous to the point of laughing in the theater i remember saying that i liked this movie as it released but i dont like how we couldnt establish something new with this character in the sense that even nick fury knows more before we knew about it instead i get the tesseract kind of alright idea i like that the skrull have been established and i hope to see the super skrull of legend and it be carols friend would be intriguing i fear though over the direction youve chosen to push this character and why she had to appear in endgame i dont get it why are you making streaming content shows any way just give me a good hour and forty minutes with a story depending some characters and their growth and make it really just a good story i believe you guys had the tools and now i have to sit through a whole series to see an arch i dont want that but i want to see the scarlet witch on the silver screen and i especially want to see the captain america fallout of bucky and falcons loss but now i have a loki series as well why i would rather see these talents elsewhere in short contained stories leading to bigger ideas and hints at things happening the cosmic step will be interesting but if this is our step towards it with captain marvel im feeling disappointed especially that nick fury only gets a magic box we knew he already had by some means like howard fishing it out of the ocean and how he lost his eye trusting someone too much i really was okay with the cat and his eye but still wasnt very great he literally gets to be who he turns into in avengers no new secrets just holes in logic in why avengers got their calling card named such an initiative im happy non the less that she is a powerful super hero and i liked some of the shots of her as if they were right from a marvel comic it had an interesting plot twist and i didnt even get that it mirrored real world events to some degree just realities in war i liked that minerva was such a sick addition i love what jude law did brie larson wasnt always bad in the movie either and it was cool seeing her stand up i just wanted to see her succeed instead of just getting up or making that punch just that little rebel spark that told her she could do it instead i got the sense she wouldnt really stop or back down which was also good just when she spoke while fighting it was so forced not the worst just made for really iron man esque feeling i didnt need in this movie or when she yells back at an enemy im reminded of lord of the rings which reminds me of thor and i just see all these old characters that wont feature much in the future of the mcu becoming embodied by someone else poorly she needs to really tell them what works and what does is that yell not the asking for keys to the cuffs cause she is just escaping anyway the line is just so fast as well no call response just like shes talking to herself anyways not bad but not good
Mar 23 2019,positive,the real issues here is the script which goes from super funny quippy dialogue to terrible exposition like bad whiplash throughout the film when it works its fun when it doesnt it hurts
Mar 23 2019,negative,overall a very bland film captain marvel lacks the style and creativity of recent entries in the mcu such as guardians of the galaxy 2 or thor ragnarok there are funny and entertaining bits sprinkled throughout the movie but the film entirely falls apart in its generic and offensively boring third act
Mar 23 2019,neutral,good humor but overall is a story of an almighty woman without charisma
Mar 23 2019,negative,if i were teenage girl this movie would be awesome but its worst superhero movie ever
Mar 23 2019,positive,pleasently surprised do not understand the hate this movie seems to be getting was also quite surprised by the storyline for the skrulls  and being surprised is kinda what i dont expect from the marvel machine so all in all  without going into that much detail i got more than i thought i would
Mar 23 2019,positive,one of the best marvel movies yet
Mar 23 2019,positive,its a disclosure movie with tonsofun
Mar 23 2019,positive,great story and good set up for end game a couple of hokie parts but good action throughout brie larson was great casting 
Mar 23 2019,neutral,a banal film with mediocre battle sequences final battle was forgettable at best marred with a platitudinous war cry for female oppression which is outdated
Mar 23 2019,negative,brie larson weights the whole franchise down we wonï 12tmt be mad if sheï 12tms replaced     the fans
Mar 23 2019,positive,captain marvel was a pleasant surprise brie larsen is wonderful and the studioâtms treatment of her powers independence and character was amazing so nice to watch a movie where the female lead didnâtmt have to processworkthrough a romantic relationship in order to find meaning  resolution highly recommend this movie
Mar 23 2019,negative,captain marvel was not a good film and i am not saying this because of the controversy around the film about brie larson and stuff this is not what it is about captain marvels character was so under development she felt like just because she had powers means that she can act differently i didnt enjoy that it felt so rushed to get to her powers and the skulls they ruin that the skulls were already evil in the comics but after seeing this film they ruin those skrulls not a good plot either it was so stupid i didnt enjoy it im sorry i am going to give captain marvel a d
Mar 22 2019,positive,so glad i didnt waste my money seeing it in 4dx just an ok movie
Mar 22 2019,negative,first i donâtmt care what she said about white dudes didnâtmt get my panties in a bunch what i care about is the acting and she sucks at it how many times can she make that perplexed face marvel is so good at casting it makes we wonder what she has on disney the best way to describe her is vanilla she will be drowned out in endgame by actors with charm and character overall the movie is alright especially once captain bad faces realizes her true potential but i put this at the bottom of marvel movies along with im2
Mar 22 2019,positive,biggest biff with the film trying to bank off of the recent retro hype ready player one bumblebee thor ragnarok stranger things and possibly the starter of the trend in guardaians of the galaxy all took things that some of us grew up with and molded them into the film so that not only were they a story about a hero but a story created from the hearts of our nostalgia its why all of those movies have been such hits and its why this film seems so flat yay she had knee ripped out jeans and fell through a blockbuster good job capturing the essence of the nineties also where has captain marvel been for the past 30 years i guess only when half of the earths population is gone does it warrant a true emergency for the superman of the marvel universe because in dc they call him in even when toast gets too crispy carol danvers not kara danvers supergirl of course skips the whole learn your powers tutorial and goes straight into kicking ronan the accusers fleet around like beach balls and being essentially superman never have been a fan of the man of steel because other than his famous weakness he really isnt relatable in captain america we see that he cherishes his strength because he once was weak in iron man we see a snob using his money for something pseudo good his intentions are often wrong so kant would say he isnt really a hero so im not really a fan of him either anymore thor has lost his powers multiple times due to selfishness and had to learn to be selfless and work with others and the list goes on but carols main thing is that she used to fall down a lot copied from batman much one of the failings of the justice league film is that the moment superman is revived steppenwolf is kicked around like a new whelping puppy to introduce captain marvel like this is really lazy writing and it would have been much better if she was a new and upandcoming hero like spiderman because then the plot holes of her never being around wouldnt be present either way her character is kinda boring and the film itself is a more entertaining version of green lantern even borrowed the original color scheme really the only thing that saves it from being horrible is goose and fury and wanting to see avengers this is our desperate grab for some solace after the amazing ending given in infinity war and it really comes up short i cant say i didnt like it but its one of the lesser entries in the mcu
Mar 22 2019,negative,goose saves the film and is literally a running joke throughout however please dont put her carol danvers aka captain marvel in anymore films show us your movie editing skills and edit her out
Mar 22 2019,positive,i really dont get how people can hate on this movie great acting great action great origin story there was mystery and intrigue in the plot to keep me watching and a great setup for her role in avengers endgame extra credit for the love they gave stan lee in this film a solid 90 for this film critics and audience are wrong on this one
Mar 22 2019,negative,good movie but not up to mcu standards plus it strayed way too far iâtmm good with creating new storylines from the comics but this movie just reengineered way too much
Mar 22 2019,positive,better movie than wonder woman gal gadot was better superhero than captain marvel i liked it
Mar 22 2019,positive,i enjoyed it a lot it wasnt as good as black panther but it was much better than wonder woman especially as a femaleled flick  there was no love interest for the lead character which i believe might be a first for a superhero movie it was very refreshing you can take great feminist messages from this movie or you can just sit back and enjoy it as it is on its face a fun popcorn movie i loved seeing samuel l jackson he should be in every movie there were some minor flawsfor instance as soon as i saw jude law i knew he would probably turn out to be a bad guy i think the only movie ive ever seen him in where hes not a bad guy were the sherlock holmes movies i loved all the characters and there was tons of action  it wasnt too much action like sayaquaman the plot was a bit better too but it could have been handled with a little more finesse marvels movies often seem to be very heavyhanded to me some of it did strain credibility but probably no more than in most superhero movies i loved the cat i look forward to seeing captain marvel return in endgame
Mar 22 2019,negative,overall quality of the film was ok but as far as marvel movies go it was terrible captain marvel is like superman she is not an underdog her main trial to overcome was understanding how strong she is which is stupid all the other marvel heroes followed that similar pattern except they were still the underdog in the fight ironmans villain had a stronger suit black panthers villain was a better fighter  even thor which was probably the strongest hero until captain marvel could not defeat his sister on his own captain marvel is like the superman of marvel which makes her film terrible because you can not make a good film on someone who is fighting people who are incredibly weaker than she is as a character she really didnt bring a lot of humer to the movie that was main done by nick fury with fury her movie would have been trash honestly this movie makes the top 3 worst marvel movies ever made
Mar 22 2019,positive,not the worst from the mcu but certainly not the best i think it does what it was designed to do move the arc along for the big movie coming in april entertaining and fun and worth a go in the theatre 
Mar 22 2019,negative,i had a hard time watching this movie because the acting of brie larson was mediocre and the scenes were cringe it was kinda a marvel film but not really because captain marvel was not a hero to easily relate with for someone not having there memory they sure act very privileged and prideful the movie felt rushed and honestly should never have been made captian marvel could have been good if you had introduced her way before endgame and maybe someone who was more humble and not so full of her self just saying dc made a better representation of a woman super hero with wonder woman dont waste your time with captain marvel
Mar 22 2019,negative,worst marvel movie i actually fell asleep halfway even though i wanted to like it dont bother
Mar 22 2019,negative,boring character boring movie
Mar 22 2019,negative,ok movie not the best from marvel
Mar 22 2019,positive,watching samuel l jackson is the best part in this movie
Mar 22 2019,positive,it is really a good movie i dont understand why people dont like it
Mar 22 2019,positive,the good a subtly displayed message of feminism that is not shoved down your throat and makes you aware of daytoday sexism in society they also had a black single mom and played her off without even any sense of token minority brie larson and the beautifully deaged samuel l jackson were an outstanding onscreen combo coulson stolenthe show in his limited screen time ben mendelson was great too as was goose the cat     the bad so much wasted potential jude law the star force gemma chan the kree they were extras with no reason to care for them no screen time and no significance to the plot the skrulls were also absolutely wasted the twist did not work at all the skrulls were such great villains and thenthey werent the shape shifting aliens had such importance in the comics and there were so many places they could have gone with it all for nothing the action was bland the final battle was anticlimactic and could hardly even be considered a fight also nick fury losing his eye was almost as disappointing as ben kingsley in iron man 3
Mar 22 2019,positive,a great addition to the mcu
Mar 22 2019,positive,captain marvel as a concept shouldve knocked it out of the park introducing carol danvers the skrulls and expanding on the kree this film should have set us up for a lot of great things like a secret invasion story it didnt    the scenes with carol danvers and nick fury are some of the best in the entire mcu so why is this only getting 3 stars everything else including a character maria seemingly only to champion women painfully explicitly even though it does implicitly do so much better throughout the film changing the skrulls to be the stereotypical oppressed people the supreme intelligence to be a strange hive mind and marvell to be a woman i mean why its not because they needed more strong female characters carol danvers and maria stereotypicalfeminist rambeau were already there playing such on the nose tracks as no doubts just a girl yes we get it marvel the lead is female thats fine but can we stop jerking ourselves off and get down to the movie now and straight up ripping scenes from other films inexplicably being one yippee from straight up lifting a space fight from the phantom menace most unforgivably from raiders of the lost ark having the suddenlymuchweaker male villain challenging the suddenlymuchstronger female villain to a fight with no powers only to get blasted out of the way with an i dont need to prove anything to you the get knocked down but i get up again trope is also painfully present    and can we talk about carols powers so her power is not given to her by the kree but it is given to her by the kree according to the film what no you cant flipflop on a binary    about 80 of this film felt meticulously crafted to make it the best marvel film to date and then some idiot came in and smeared identity politics and continuity errors over the rest why does that not get it a 4 star 80 of the stars then because it was so nearly perfect and i want to like it so bad but that 20 taints the 80 of the film that is great making the overall product mediocre
Mar 22 2019,negative,aside from several funny nick fury scenes the movie was forgetable
Mar 22 2019,positive,the flim didnt felt different from other marvel movies another words those flimes felt special they where different is not a bad movie i like samuel l jackson in this movie and had good special affects but thats about it
Mar 22 2019,positive,should have been called  fury and goose
Mar 22 2019,positive,this movie was actually pretty good was a little skeptical about taking my 8 year old daughter but minus 1 or 2 swear words it was fine for her and she really enjoyed it
Mar 22 2019,positive,i enjoyed it very much i could totally relate to brie larsons portrayal of captain marvel her cockiness was on point i like how there isnt any romance in the film and that they focused more on establishing her character  if the films purpose was to let woman feel empowered then they got what they want i felt like i could literally fight anyone after watching this movie
Mar 22 2019,positive,captain marvel was ok nothing spectacular or special it was a kinda pretentious
Mar 22 2019,negative,overall very boring unimpressive and unimaginative fight scenes obvious throws to female empowerment that felt out of place in a marvel movie  the best part was fury and the cat
Mar 22 2019,negative,its exactly what everyone is saying it is
Mar 22 2019,negative,when people start off describing the movie by not the worst pay attention id say its worth red box pricing but not full boat at the the theater 
Mar 22 2019,negative,poor cinematography and the most boring marvel movie weï 12 12 12 12tmve ever watch
Mar 22 2019,positive,it was so great and suspenseful i loved it
Mar 22 2019,positive,without giving anything away this was a decent marvel flick not the best ive seen nor as good as recent female driven comicaction flicks wonder woman but with enough laughs and action to justify its existence i enjoyed it for what it was the anticipation was almost too h8gh for this brie la
Mar 22 2019,negative,worst marvel movie made brie larson has zero charisma and the role should have been recast its a damn shame we will have to see her in endgame
Mar 22 2019,negative,fantastic movie if they didnt shove victimization down your throat went in thinking id like it and left feeling like it was a waste of money to be feed the hollywood agenda being a kid i loved superheros and leadwomen combined was amazing and being a grown woman i can not relate to being pushed down my daughter wont be being brainwashed about how men and boys demean girls and that men have zero voice hell to the no this movie was awesome it had great graphics it was nostalgic and the actress fit the role really well but its interesting how no other marveldc movie has beaten women down to this manner bravo
Mar 22 2019,negative,boring  generic worst marvel movie so far
Mar 22 2019,positive,excellent i was pleasantly surprised as i didnâtmt think itâtmd live up to expectations or be able to hold its own with the other marvel characters and movies
Mar 22 2019,positive,nice movie samuel jackson steals the show
Mar 22 2019,negative,i have no issues with the character herself larson or the fact that she seems ridiculously over powered but marvel have done a very poor job at creating a back story here the movie felt very rushed with no real integration into the mcu the movie being set in 1990 and nobody knowing anything about her in the present then suddenly shes here to save the day in 2019 also very lucky she didnt get snapped up by thanos too ï 12 12 12
Mar 22 2019,positive,it was okay the worst thing about the movie is probably brie larsons unlikable character  but the cat was cool and the skrull leader was funny
Mar 22 2019,positive,great storyline with strong character development  brie larson did a great job  loved samuel l jacksons significant role too
Mar 22 2019,positive,and put back that not interested button most of us dont want to see this film because brie larson on social media is a hypocritical sexist pigsow
Mar 22 2019,positive,itâtms fun iâtmve seen most of the marvel universe movies and this did not disappoint
Mar 22 2019,positive,our family loved it
Mar 22 2019,positive,great intro movie to captain marvel the movie has some humor and was overall a fun movie for the family it is a small glimpse into captain marvels past but seeing her brought to the big screen was awesome this movie does not live up to infinity war but it lives up to the other backstory movies that each character has had previously
Mar 22 2019,negative,what a shame  this was a chance for women to come to the forefront of film making  and they bombed  poor casting poor acting poor directing poor writing poor editing  just a disaster  the film starts out with an ill conceived idea that this species must wipe out another species to be happy  just let them go find another part of the universe to live and dont bother with them  from the very start the film jumps all over the place and no one knows whator when they are talking about and it never gets any better  really to bad as this could have been a great movie just like the original comic book was  save your time and money and forget this one
Mar 22 2019,negative,boo i would like my money back worst marvel movie thus far
Mar 22 2019,negative,undoes a decade of character development for nick fury by making him the slapstick comic relief
Mar 22 2019,positive,it was great very funny brees laughter was annoying at times and the beginning was a bit slow but other than that it was pretty good
Mar 22 2019,positive,ok movie somewhere around doctor strange and iron man 2
Mar 22 2019,positive,had a lot of fun went in expecting a fun marvel movie experience and got it 
Mar 22 2019,positive,an extremely average film that follows the marvel formula to the letter not particularly bad but just very unremarkable
Mar 22 2019,negative,i love the marvel and dc universe but this turned out to be so disappointing main character is boring and her acting is boring i expected more from captain marvel and disney characters journey doesnt interest me at all and the villain is crap shouldve just wanted to see this on netflix i hope endgame is not about captain marvel at all
Mar 22 2019,positive,overall solid movie that had some great action and connected the marvel universe the skrulls and furys role was great at times the script felt kinda forced from a few characters though brie played the part well and look forward to seeing her in additional films 
Mar 22 2019,positive,fun movie with great characters not the best marvel movie but youll enjoy your time with it
Mar 22 2019,negative,i have seen every marvel movie in the last 20 years to me marvel did a poor job on this movie captain marvel it comes down to this hero is just to over powered backed by a weak back story we are forced to just accept that this hero is the most powerful thing out there and has what been hiding for 25 years i am very put off that we have spent 10 years building up to the thanos ending to just get hit with this op hero a month before it all comes to a head
Mar 22 2019,positive,loved the character and the movie young nick fury was an amazing addition the buddy cup them works so well
Mar 22 2019,negative,terrible origin story with a lot of useless dialogue it seems more a story of a girl that needed to prove how tough she was instead of like all the other avengers just being tough through what they do she walked around the entire movie peacocking chest up and never seemed to swing her arms but kept them at her side with her fists clenched nothing in this seemed to set us up for the upcoming avengers endgame which is odd because they are only about a month apart this was by far the worst superhero movie so far and that says a lot since green lantern exists
Mar 22 2019,positive,one of my favorite heroes since the 90s good movie but i wouldnt call it one of marvels best
Mar 22 2019,neutral,she just was born a hero poor character development
Mar 22 2019,negative,boring if youï 12 12 12 12tmve seen any alien superhero movie and or buddy cop movie youï 12 12 12 12tmve seen captain marvel but cm doesnï 12 12 12 12tmt add anything new or uniquethe characters where ok but you really feel nothing for this character by the end of it unfortunately this movie suffers lazy writing with a mediocre deliverance add the fact that this movie was so caught up with its political message it kinda held it back this movie isnï 12 12 12 12tmt not unwatchable however this not something new or interesting and itï 12 12 12 12tms definitely not an origin story like youï 12 12 12 12tmve never seen before thereï 12 12 12 12tms a few laughs that come in nicely delivered buy sam l jackson however it was not enough to save it from itï 12 12 12 12tms own uninteresting story and mediocre acting definitely not the best or even close to being the best mcu movie the cat will most probably be your favorite character that should say something
Mar 22 2019,negative,i wanted a super hero film not a political agenda film the movie was so boring and without sam jackson it would have been one of the worst films of the year
Mar 22 2019,neutral,not very good average at best compared to most marvel movies felt like more of a filler to end game than a feature film
Mar 22 2019,negative,average movie not way i expected
Mar 22 2019,negative,it felt rushed and was quite disappointing to say the least
Mar 22 2019,positive,a paint by numbers origin film with a great supporting cast wasted potential in the hands of the writterdirector duo as they show lack of imagination within the marvel universe
Mar 22 2019,negative,i felt this movie fell on the low end of the spectrum for marvel movies and it my be unfair to hold it to that standard but like the bar should be higher at this point
Mar 22 2019,negative,they could have done much better with this movie  it was meh at best  for a marvel film it was disappointment  it would have been ok to watch at home for cheaper but i dont feel it was worth what i spent in the theater
Mar 22 2019,positive,dont believe the hype the movie in itself is enjoyable and earned some good laughs from myself and the rest of my theatre however this movie is just another installment in a greater franchise and its felt throughout the film with constant reminders to the bigger mcu this movie tries to stand alone but ultimately just leaves you spending most of your time wondering where carol has been for all these years the character of fury changes a lot in this movie we learn his rough grisled exterior is a lie he loses his eye in a way that undercuts jacksons earlier performances and in my personal opinion lessens the character of fury one character who i actually genuinely liked and want to see what they have in store for was monica rambeau who should become a new member of the avengers if all goes right all in all captain marvel is just another mcu film thats biggest accomplishment is
Mar 22 2019,positive,most captain marvels problems such as some undercooked plot points some underwritten characters and pacing issues stem from a short runtime which was simply not enough for this very rich and intriguing storyline yes this is the most engaging and most interesting plot in the mcu so far and i loved its twist its sf elements and the entire kreeskrull conflict was so intriguing to me some of the action and vfx are questionable but i loved the protagonist whos simply ridiculously overpowered but still a fun character with an interesting origin story nick fury steals the show throughout with his hilarious lines of dialogue maria rambeau is the heart of the film and the cat is so amusing so its not one of the best mcu films but its one of the better ones and it simply flew by for me how engaging and funny it is the connections with the other films are also excellent
Mar 22 2019,positive,a fun movie that is lacking in something i cant place what is lacking but i think i didnt like the actress for this movie also some of the lines were a bit weird all of the other aspects of the film were fine not sure if i would watch again and only watched for more back ground on end game
Mar 22 2019,negative,this entire movie was filled with an overdose of hollywood violence 90 of the movie involved filings the main character ms marvel was tied up with ropes and machines and tortured in order to extract information from her brain there are demonic looking characters that chase her throughout the movie and then she befriends them its hard to switch an evil character that looks like the devil into a good guy the story seem to be good with some morals but the entire movie was saturated with violence that it took away from the plot
Mar 22 2019,positive,one of the best standalone marvels entertains and makes his own the direction is good but not so excellent
Mar 22 2019,positive,great introduction to marvel universe a tiny bit slow in the beginning but quickly makes up for it good film
Mar 22 2019,neutral,it was ok some exciting scenes but kinda boring
Mar 22 2019,positive,the overall feel of the kree and skrull conflict was handled in a satisfactory way i would have welcomed more moral ambiguity and less clear cut villains as the plot did not appear to need a big bad villain star force did not behave in consistent ways and some of their behaviors are not wise more time should have been spent fleshing them out and bonding with them jude laws character suffers from some poor writing as his motives speech and actions are not sensible the ending did not feel earned for the main character captain marvel although i was dissatisfied with the changes to the original captain marvell this does not impact the score i give the film the skrulls could have been slightly more vicious but were entertaining and well acted monica rambeau and her mother did not add much to the film and i would have preferred if dr walter lawson took their place or more time was spent on nick furys friend ship the stakes were not high due to over the top super powers without equal the depiction of her father was bizarre and the airforce appears unprofessional but these issues were never resolved directly resolved i would have preferred more time spent growing friendships like with fury through typical buddycop conflict and resolution
Mar 22 2019,positive,i was disappointed with this film  i felt that they were unsure of what type of film that they were trying to make  in the end it   felt lie a longform commercial for avengers endgame
Mar 22 2019,negative,boring just another origins story good special effectsand most humerus was samuel jackson not a great fore runner to avengers end game
Mar 22 2019,positive,i dont know why everyone is giving this movie crap i mean it had a few cheesy moments but it sets up with the mcu really well and is an awesome girl superhero movie that has action humor and meaning behind the story i think everyone can say that they wanna see wonder woman and captain marvel fight i think everyone in general would want to see a avengers vs justice league movie
Mar 22 2019,positive,this movie was surprisingly good its one of those movies thats better than the trailers its a shame so many stupid people that dont like someone in the movie would give it a fake negative rating because they are following the flock of some political right wing agenda im seeing it again tomorrow 
Mar 22 2019,negative,great acting but the fight scenes became noise and the writing leaned towards dc rather than the occassional funny and clever marvel
Mar 22 2019,positive,great movie i actually would like to see more 90s content it was really cool seeing all the 90s easter eggs
Mar 22 2019,negative,it was an okay movie maybe on the same level as antman but other then that it wasnt what i thought it was going in so many people built up the hype like it was the next great thing i hope it doesnt impact endgame too much but i think im done with super hero movies after endgame
Mar 22 2019,negative,the movie failed to elicit true buyin in ragnorok when thor truly discovered his powers and was kicking butt on the bridge everything worked together to make me want to stand a cheer it elicited emotion   in the similar scene in this movie when danvers truly discovers her powers it does not elicit the same response the music is weak and it seems a little forced and hokey   the first avengers movie elicited emotion   ragnorok elicited emotion   black panther elicited emotion   captain marvel elicited a yawn at best a ï 12 12mehï 12 12ï 12â
Mar 22 2019,negative,middle to back of the pack marvel movie
Mar 22 2019,negative,one of the hardest movies to watch
Mar 22 2019,negative,so i came back to my profile to find my review for captain marvel had been deleted for some unbeknownst reason so just to summarise again    loved the homage to stan lee in the opening  pretty interesting story with the kree and skarls  pretty dang cool effects    however    massive plot holes its shown that they have the power to warp throuygh space gotg style but the main point of the story is that the kree are trying to get their hands on a warp drive despite them already having many  there is no development for captain marvel at all she is shown to be unstable and emotional in the beginning but then ends the film the exact same  her powers are contrived 80s saturday morning cartoon style by absorbing radiation  hamfisted gender politics all throughout the film   they absolutely ruin nick furys character ill not spoil but damn do they ruin his character with one fell swoop    would miss
Mar 22 2019,negative,i was excited to see this movie as i am all of the marvel movies this one left me sorely disappointed though brie larson has zero emotional range apparently sheï 12 12tms basically just the female version of tony stark when it comes to personality everything is a joke and any interaction with other characters just needs a smart remark add in the fact she has zero weaknesses and you have a boring character who i could just care less about by the end of the movie fury was terrible also along with colson apparently in the 90s they were just two idiots working for the government   the cat was the best thing in this movie watching fury act with this cat was just making me cringe oh and watching brie run just absolutely made me crack up they couldnï 12 12tmt fix that with cgi or something  one of the greatest superheroes in the universe and she looks like sheï 12 12tms never ran in her life like during the audition they never considered actually maybe feeling the role with someone with just the tiniest bit of athleticism   the writing in the movie was idiotic also why would captain marvel and her best friends very young daughter try to talk her best friend into leaving her daughter to go into space to fight aliens idiotic then you find out oh wait captain marvel can just defeat them all singlehanded and you risked your life and leaving your daughter to grow up alone all for no reason at all this is easily my lambast favorite marvel movie what a waste of 2 hours i sincerely hope she doesnï 12 12tmt ruin end game
Mar 22 2019,positive,its good and great movie this is awesome captain marvel 
Mar 22 2019,positive,i liked the movie and my son daughter and wife liked the movie  if you take the movie as it is a marvel origin story movie without all the preconceptions from the marketing and what was said before the movie you will find a decent marvel movie i will put it in the same as ant man and the wasp  paul rud might be a little more likable than brie larson but still good  both my kids liked the movie a lot and we enjoyed it as a family  so in my opinion it served its purpose  i look forward to seeing cm in end game
Mar 22 2019,negative,over hyped looking forward to endgame 
Mar 22 2019,positive,it was a solid kick off for captain marvel if you have a daughter take her to it does a good portal of a strong women capable of success and never giving up
Mar 22 2019,negative,probably the most disappointing marvel movie the biggest issue of the film is probably captain marvel herself as shes sloppily written not relateable and not in the slightest bit interesting the is the same with all the characters as the movie moves way to quick and dedicates almost no time to developing characters so that we the audience can care and if i dont care then whats the point of following them on their journey the only redeeming qualities to the movie are ben mendelsohns and samuel l jacksons performances the score and of course goose the cat overall captain marvel is probably the worst film in the franchise  grade d
Mar 22 2019,positive,low ratings originally scared me off but you know the movie was a solid origin story
Mar 22 2019,negative,marvel trying to easily wrap up the avengers story with a op character  weak acting cheap buddy cop film with so many plot holes its like rotten swiss cheese my recommendation save ir money and watch a youtube review
Mar 22 2019,negative,like an overbudgeted version of smallville extremely flat story bad acting
Mar 22 2019,negative,an enormous flying piece of shit
Mar 22 2019,positive,the worlds most popular movie franchise at long last releases its first female led movie one beyond wordscaptain marvel the mcus 21st movie takes us on an intergalactic adventure similar in the vein of some of the franchises best such as guardians of the galaxy and thor ragnarok yet it keeps the premise entirely original featuring oscarlevel talent such as brie larson captain marvel and jude law captain marvel continues the anticipated path set by avengers infinity war creating its own lore and corner within the mcu all while leading us to the final destination that is avengers endgame next april    the movie depicts the neverbefore told story of the kreeskrull war as well as how fury lost his eye being set in the past captain marvel has a great deal of freedom which it fully exploits referencing popular culture movies such as top gun and pulp fiction this makes the movie the blastfromthepast we never even knew we wanted the history of the mcu is greatly broadened while somehow managing to greatly setup the franchises future the movie proves that there are great stories to tell by taking a step back     captain marvel greatly succeeds with one thing that comes with any marvel movie the humour the mid90s setting allows the movie to create humour from infamous elements set in this period recognisable to anyone who lived in the 90s there are no cliche jokes all the humour is enacted through the behaviour of individual characters which are developed extremely well  there are many minor titbits that many fans of the mcu or those who have recently watched particular instalments in the franchise may spot this is mainly accomplished through shared characters  these characters do have large roles in the movie but in no way does the plot rely on their previous appearances one thing millions of fans have been clamoring for ever since marvels the avengers was achieved by captain marvel agent philip j coulson coulson was given a large role in this movie all while not contradicting the 110 episodes of his own show this is a mustsee for fans of the show    the makeup costumes set designs and visual effects are all the best in the game there are very few movies i would rank higher than captain marvel on this basis especially as much of the movie is a spaceepic the action is much better than the majority of blockbuster movies marvel has started to use longer takes for their fight scenes and i think this feature is here to stay seeing the movie in imax 3d i benefitted greatly from all of the above the movie utilises its imax format to the maximum having multiple imax scenes throughout the runtime the majority is shot in imax during these scenes imax viewers are presented with an extra 26 of footage there is no misuse of 3d which many often complain about with other movies while the movie was converted to 3d the 3d conversion is honestly the best ive seen recently i didnt even realise it was converted until i was informed later imax should be your first portofcall  the movie always keeps you on the journey of carol danvers never giving you the greater perspective of the movie until the title character herself discovers it it is an interesting and lucrative concept  a way to diversify the general plots and shy away from any similarities to other movies you are always kept guessing while enticed into the story once the true nature of the movie is revealed you are in for one hell of a ride just make sure you stay behind until the very end of the credits    there is no universe in which i do not highly highly recommend you to see this movie  imax approved
Mar 22 2019,negative,nothing special about this movie story was mediocre action was lacking and the character was dull
Mar 22 2019,negative,took the day off to see this was disappointed  good effects and sam jackson looks great but a terrible branch of the film story arc and terrible acting by larson
Mar 22 2019,positive,i loved this movie so much
Mar 22 2019,positive,i thought this movie looked stupid but i ended up really enjoying it 
Mar 22 2019,positive,i read the reviews and was hesitant to pay money to watch the film now i am glad i did because it was another marvel movie that i thoroughly enjoyed i dont know about the politics that everyone is tripping over and frankly i never listen to the actors off screen anyway they played their parts well enough that my whole family enjoyed it and it built well for the end game movie coming up next month leave your politics at home suspend your reality and enjoy another action packed movie its really that simple 
Mar 22 2019,positive,one of my favourite marvel films a must see after infinity war
Mar 22 2019,positive,i think i like it nice plot for me
Mar 22 2019,neutral,its an okay movie captain marvel is not the best marvel movie but its far from the worst marvel movie its somewhere right in the middle if youre looking for a fun 3 hour ride this is it
Mar 22 2019,positive,good movie i do not why people are hating on it is it the best movie marvel has made no but neither was the first two thor movies it introduce a new character into mcu that all all of the movies in the mcu has changed origin or character from the comics get over it and go to the movie to be entertained stop hating or loving the actors who play the characters now if they cant act that a different story at the end of the day it just a movie if you never saw it or world would not end
Mar 22 2019,positive,i went to see this with my two boys 8 and 10 and they loved it better than average marvel movie lots of fun and good acting
Mar 22 2019,negative,worst marvel movie acting was terrible and the script was almost as bad
Mar 22 2019,neutral,you never really feel anxious about the titular characters fate as shes always the most powerful being in the room in all scenes in the climax of the film she goes from extremely powerful to way too powerful with the only learning curve for the character being to accept and embrace her emotions no two characters spend enough time together onscreen for me as a viewer to feel any form of bond or chemistry between them or to care when things take a turn for the worse in their relationship i did like the action sequences and some of the supporting cast specially ben mendelsohns character the film also  plays with the idea of how one can be manipulated into perceiving something or someone as good or evil which i liked but its never fully explored and finally nick fury what did they do with thy eye 
Mar 22 2019,negative,worst marvel movie i have seen so boring and couldnt comcentrate on the movie i enjoyed green lantern more than this and that says a lot
Mar 22 2019,positive,i wasnt expecting a good marvel movie because the trailer was not that exciting but this movie is just another great marvel movie and the role model for woman is very nice also the music and the other characters were cool to watch
Mar 22 2019,positive,i went in not paying attention to the drama around the movie and actually really enjoyed it i was worried about being fatigued from marvel movies but  genuinely  this brought life back into my enthusiasm  for marvel movies loved it going to see it again
Mar 22 2019,positive,great prequel and popcorn flick
Mar 22 2019,negative,total waste of 17 dollars the writing is awful  very choppy
Mar 22 2019,positive,amazing movie i cant wait to see her in the end games
Mar 22 2019,positive,i didnt know what to expect or feel after watching this film especially when viewing other reviews online however i was pleasantly surprised with how well it was executed and i really felt it slotted very nicely into the mcus plans for avengers endgames release in april not my favourite marvel film but definately managed to stand on its own an entertaining watch and a necessary piece of the mcu jigsaw in my eyes
Mar 22 2019,negative,very bad movie incoherent plot bad usage of the skrull characters didnt not feel like there were anything at stake dont recommend 
Mar 22 2019,negative,a terrible movie of superheroes
Mar 22 2019,negative,best thing about the movie is nick fury     all action scenes for captain marvel  you just see light flashes without being able to know how is doing what 
Mar 21 2019,positive,a good intro movie a lot oficina questions the trama change was well driven but i dont know something is missing
Mar 21 2019,positive,loved it such a great storyline the time flew by so fast and i didnt look at my watch once to see how much longer till it ended which i do for a lot of movies 
Mar 21 2019,positive,this movie is well done and a blast and shame on all the misogynistic trolls trying to tank it with low ratings here go see it you wont be disappointed 
Mar 21 2019,negative,the lead actress lacks charisma and is completely miscast in this role someone like jennifer lawrence would have been so much better sam jackson helps the movie when it comes to humor and charisma though the films script is mediocre at best one of the worst marvel films made so far this after the amazing infinity war is an absolute disaster
Mar 21 2019,neutral,weak story and ok action adds little to the marvel universe
Mar 21 2019,negative,an ok movie for marvel after black panther infinity war ragnarok this movie is boring and nick fury was the best thing in this movie along with the cat only worth watching for the post credit scenes and nothing more
Mar 21 2019,neutral,this movie has no surprises but this movie is a okay
Mar 21 2019,negative,unninspired and bland its difficult to feel your ticket price well spent when the flerken is the only good thing you saw in this movie the delivery was so bad it seemed like a rush to hit the screens project now that i have seen it i wish i had just waited for endgame it really is not necessary to see this one
Mar 21 2019,positive,not a great movie but not terrible either if you didnt know it was a marvel movie you might assume its an offshoot star trek movie its not marvels best work but not their worst i thought fury seemed out of character a bit i thought jude law and brie larson seemed completely out of place in the whole movie they didnt do a bad job they just seemed awkward the entire time almost like they were recast last minute and had no time to learn their roles
Mar 21 2019,negative,very poorly told story all around incredibly disappointed
Mar 21 2019,negative,captain marvel was  boring
Mar 21 2019,positive,freakin loved this movie its fun and full of action 
Mar 21 2019,positive,the fighting scenes fell short of my expectation for a mcus  blockbuster
Mar 21 2019,positive,certainly one of the best captain marvel is all i wanted to see
Mar 21 2019,positive,i saw the movie a week after it landed in cinemas and enjoyed it enough it had a nice plot with a compelling twist which drove story elements to keep you engaged but ultimately left the film confused as to who its main villain was leaving it in an strange space when compared to other mcu super hero movies   it was funnier than i thought it would be
Mar 21 2019,positive,late into the endgame marvel introduces us to its latest superhero captain marvel is a lot of fun with humor exciting action and a differently structured story than the norm but it struggles to bring a variety of new ideas and produce as mindblowing of results as previous entries brie larson is a talented actress who has given several exceptional performances but she appears somewhat restricted in this role either by her own limits or by the direction hard to say the way the film portrays the title character is good enough to become invested but will hopefully be more rewarding as she progresses in later movies hopefully under the direction of someone with a strong vision and style to improve upon the foundation samuel l jackson stands out as one of the more memorable aspects his natural charisma reacting to the scifi elements and absurdity is a highlight of the film in an attempt to separate itself from the normal superhero story structure the film progresses its plot in nonchronological order this is a somewhat refreshing way to tell a usual origin story and should be commended for its ambition but the story itself can still be predictable while this is not necessarily detrimental to the film as a whole when a film comes in as the 21st addition to a franchise they have to pull off something astounding and unique to stand out however while the superhero story may not be anything new captain marvel follows through with entertaining action and effective humor the writing balances a serious and a playful tone about as well as it should it is definitely on par with some of the other solo films of the series it is difficult to pin down aspects that were especially astounding and what was especially disappointing as the film goes back and forth between ambitious and fairly standard overall captain marvel is a welcome addition to this impressive franchise and presents a welcome character with room to grow but it has little to make it stand out as much as its predecessors and remains as a filler episode in a show that is nearing a finale
Mar 21 2019,positive,i enjoyed this movie a lot it had great action and some fun touches of humor well worth seeing in the theater i definitely want to see it again
Mar 21 2019,positive,like always marvel films are great this was a great origin story on captain marvel
Mar 21 2019,negative,took too long to get me interested i literally fell asleep in the movie
Mar 21 2019,neutral,wasnt great but wasnt terrible either  brie larson is kind of just blah for a lot of the movie  i havent seen a lot of movies with her but from what ive read shes an outstanding actress which means the script and directors are responsible for her being that way  all in all it wasnt the worst marvel movie but its definitely in the bottom 20
Mar 21 2019,positive,marvel movies never disappoint  i love how they made her bad ass great movie highly recommend
Mar 21 2019,positive,with all the gossip in the background of this movie from what the main actress said about white men didnt hinder at all a good movie like to see what happens now in end game
Mar 21 2019,neutral,brie larson is extremely bland and they donâtmt show the true power of the character but isnâtmt terrible and was pretty enjoyable at times although it doesnâtmt do anything special or interesting and there isnâtmt anything impressive either
Mar 21 2019,positive,very good movie to was great 
Mar 21 2019,neutral,it was just not that good the dialogue was horrible the acting was bad except for jude law who wasnt given much but he worked with what he had and the marvell thing if you are going to do something like that you might as well just not have the character in there the only reason i gave it 2 and a half stars is because it progressed the story line
Mar 21 2019,positive,well we come across the most different  super hero movie yet but its not the best marvel a character isnt that original but the special effects are great but it needed to be longer captain marvel will live in a special place in the mcu but it doesnt live up to whwt was expected
Mar 21 2019,positive,great soundtrack this movie really brought the marvel universe to a higher level 
Mar 21 2019,negative,it seemed like marvel just slapped this movie together because shes going to be in avengers other than the avengers ties its just a 2 hour backstory about a character no one knew existed before the infinity war credit scene
Mar 21 2019,positive,great movie do not listen to the critics there have been worse marvel comics movies
Mar 21 2019,positive,for me this latest edition to the marvel cinematic canon falls somewhere between thor the dark world and iron man 3  definitely not as bad as iron man 2 now this might sound like a bad comparison but i happened to liked both thor 2 and iron man 3  i just feel they rank as the least  developed and imaginative of the marvel movies    for me captain marvel as a character is amazing  both male and female versions the possibility of creating a tremendous movie experience is more than there     pros     the story i think the story was strong and very creative in the way it unfolded it also developed a   few twists as well that kept me interested and intrigued in knowing what would happen next    the setting being a genxer it was a nice to finally see the midninties shown in a sentimental way though i think the music was a little to gratuitous and seemed out of place at times    cons    character development unfortunately what couldve been heralded and has been as being marvels answer to dcs wonder woman suffers irreversibly from shallow character development of our heroine brie larsons acting is actually quite good contrary to some reviews but is crippled by lazy writing and in my opinion hohum directing    i didnt really feel for cap mar much at all and her plight was not an emotional one especially when its considered that her whole life has been one big fat lie some breathing room with genuine emotional reflection by cap mar would have helped this big time instead our supe is reduced to flat oneliners  as she goes through the motions like a high schooler trying to finish her shift at the mcdonalds    i also found the veiled attempt at addressing the contemporary border and immigration debate to be insulting to both sides of the issue if only because it seemed forced convoluted and made immigrants seem like shapeshifting green creatures from outer space yeahjust wow manwhy why even try    all in all i had fun time eating popcorn on my birthday with my wife my wife who had no idea what to expect not being familiar with the character at all was totally into it as they say i couldnt help but feel a little disappointed only because captain marvel couldve been so much more
Mar 21 2019,positive,better than black panther or wonder woman not as good as dr strange loved the fact that the 1990s are vintage now fun movie may have to go see in 3d
Mar 21 2019,positive,not great poor acting from the main character great cgi moments
Mar 21 2019,positive,well done marvel film all the hallmarks oh dear a mcu movie but with a new little known character
Mar 21 2019,positive,not sure why the ratings are so low at least 78 user rating worthy
Mar 21 2019,negative,meh predictable and unentertaining im sorry but casting must have picked a name out of a hat because this actress is so stiff literally anyone else couldve done better 
Mar 21 2019,positive,i do not watch movie trailers and i feel this helped me to enjoy this movie more i dont engage in movie marketing at all and that also helped me to garner innocent enjoyment from this movie there are too many opinions in general about this film it makes it harder to review it cards on the tablei do not support the tenets of modern feminisim and do not largely appreciate being force fed female heroines simply for the sake of it i still enjoyed this movie my bias is not that deep    the good things in this movie i liked the 90s theme i liked the soundtrack fury is very good in this movie i enjoyed his character in this brie larsson is compotent and likeable enough despite some flaws i liked the human side of captain marvels character and the exploration of carol danvers as a human on earth i liked how the skrull could manipulate memory i also liked how that dreaminess was woven into the plot in general i liked rambo and the flight scenes i liked the space element to the movie i think marvel did a good job of making danvers an esteemed character in her own right in time for avengers endgame    things i didnt like even although brie was component she lacked a little something and i felt there was a distance between captain marvel and the audience the connection felt a little forced nothing to do with feminism but the feel good emotional moments of the film were cheesy its happened millions of times with male characters so i am willing to write it off the extra cut scenes at the end were pretty pathetic the cat was not my favourite i thought the cat was a bit weird and lame i almost think captain marvel is too powerful however i have had that feeling before with other characters naming the entire avengers after her was a step too far that did annoy me also jude law was not hugely believable and was sub par    overall a very good slice of escapism i couldnt put my finger on it to define exactly why i think this movie deserves a high score i think it is just an entertaining ride from start to finish and couldnt explain it in any more depth than that
Mar 21 2019,positive,the movie is not as bad as most people says for some reason the movie received a lot of hate even before it was released which already proves the hate it gets is not coming from serious critics   while itï 12 12tms true the mayor twist of the movie is a huge turn down for comic fans people has to understand that the cinematic universe is not the same as in the comics and is not a bad thing to have some differences otherwise people will always know what is going to happen next the skrull makeup is really bad tho  the synergy between carol danvers and nick fury is excellent samuel jackson really helped our main character to shine and show us her funny side  the movie was overall fun to watch entertaining which is the purpose of going to the cinema after all that already is enough to give it a 10 out of 20 if we consider the movie with more depth iï 12 12tmd add 2 or 3 more points for a 13 out of 20   should you watch it sure youï 12 12tmre gonna have a fun time is it one of the best mcu movies no is it one of the worst no thatï 12 12tms reserved for thor 2 iron man 3 and the ant man movies this one is better than those
Mar 21 2019,positive,solid movie to introduce another marvel character into the mcu however i felt as if this was  a little rushed but to live up to the hype of previous mcu movies is a tall task
Mar 21 2019,negative,cant believe how boring it is
Mar 21 2019,neutral,this was in the midrange when it came to comic book movies good but not great and a few tweaks might have made it better while brie larson is more charismatic as the lead carol danvers as captain marvel than the trailers her character still feels underdeveloped and detached danvers is a character that starts as human us navy pilot that through a chain of events becomes a part human and partalien super being that has lost memory of her previous human life before joining an alien race called the kree some events take danvers to 1994 earth to fight against a shapeshifting alien race called the skrulls with the aid of shield agent nick fury samuel jackson the standouts are jackson as fury and ben mendolsohn as the skrull leader talos the story has some nice humor action but much of it gets lost through the various plot holes rough pacing and some cringy political and nonpolitical moments how she got her powers is not explained very well and a bit different from the comics spoiler making the original male captain marvel or marvell into annette benning was in poor taste in my opinion
Mar 21 2019,positive,kind of mediocre not terrible but nothing particularly great if you like the marvel franchise its probably worth seeing just to help with story elements in future movies if youre not a current marvel fan its not a good first impression
Mar 21 2019,negative,ive heard a lot of badd things about this movie but i still wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt because i am a huge marvel fan i only gave an extra star because of samuel l jackson over all a snoozer brie larsons character as  captain marvel was as entertaining as my cat sleeping on my sofa
Mar 21 2019,negative,the media portrayed this movie as the best movie ever it really wasnt it gets the cookie for women breaking the ceiling but i really felt minimal impact throughout the movie this is not the type of movie i can easily recommend to anyone the graphics were amazing  only thing memorable was the cat
Mar 21 2019,positive,despite the running time captain marvel moved and felt like a breath of fresh air in lieu of the films contemporaries within the mcu despite the feminist undertones i was glad to find the film not overly preachy yet finding stable ground in the era in which i was born setting the perfect backdrop for a film that boasted damn near every great thing about the 90s  great comic book stories that drastically change the perception of the lead characters experimental and grunge rock tlcs waterfalls and samuel l jackson blicking anything that moves in blockbuster action films
Mar 21 2019,negative,cheesy low budget unfunny embarassing most of the times
Mar 21 2019,positive,wow what is it with this movie not being in the high 90s by audience rating im a marvel fan that being said this movie is up there with any of them and is a must see to dove tale with the next biggie the concluding infinity war with thanos series brie larson as captain marvelomg awesome i cant wait to watch her bring us the marvel supergirl in the coming years this movie was so totally worth it
Mar 21 2019,positive,i had a great time watching this movie everyone should see it
Mar 21 2019,neutral,i didnt liked that movie at all  her face expression was the same all the time
Mar 21 2019,positive,i dont know anything about the comics so cant compare character portrayal  with that     but as a film in its own right i found it quite enjoyable as a origin story goes though i didnt  warm up to the  capt marvel character    i found the portrayal to be a bit too serious and the continual stoic demeanour  throughout  the film made it difficult to get emotionally  tied  to her journey as the story unfolded    at this moment capt marvel  despite having the most ridiculous powers ive  seen an individual possess in this universe  by far  has the weakest likeability traits ive ever seen in any of these films i can only hope they look to progress this character in a way to make the character more appealing because as it is now  i have no interest in where they take this character
Mar 21 2019,negative,weak story characters and action leads this film to be arguably the weakest in the entire marvel collection the only highlights was nick fury and goose the cat the biggest problem is that the main character captain marvel as a character is boring inconsistent and unrelatable which dooms the film even the fun 90s nostalgia references couldnt save this film and dont even get me started on the poor action sequences hopefully marvel can find away to develop this character as im sure they will want to use her often in the upcoming films
Mar 21 2019,positive,it was very empowering but not in the cheesy ways every show is trying to contribute these days it was authentic a good comedy and left my friends and i with an overwhelming sense of joy with the way captain marvel stood up to the ones who wronged her and the cast meshed beautifully please go see this movie you wonâtmt regret  it
Mar 21 2019,positive,fun movie exited to see her in end game
Mar 21 2019,positive,its often hard to depict an extremely powerful character but marvel tried and it works not the best but great movie the visuals are beautiful and the action is fun goose is phenomenal and fury is awesome 910
Mar 21 2019,positive,decent filler movie and introduction to the character that we need before her appearance in endgame what this movie lacks however is decent writing and a plausible weakness for carol
Mar 21 2019,negative,there was something missing in the first hour of this movie i think it was entertainment for a mcu movie it seemed pretty slow boring uninteresting and not exciting i dont know if things got better after the first hour since i left i tried but knew i wouldnt make it to the end let alone the surprise after credit clips 
Mar 21 2019,neutral,it was an average movie with decent visuals it did not hit the retro mark that thor ragnarok did or the humor it wasnt as compelling as black panther it was worth seeing but not essential to understand the marvel universe
Mar 21 2019,negative,my favorite part was when she did all of the stuff that a man can do for example punch old ladies
Mar 21 2019,neutral,visual effects are great  the story was badyou cant connect to the character and the way they want to push feminism in this movie makes it toxic i have no problem with female heroes like wonder woman but the way they do it in this film is to much
Mar 21 2019,positive,the movie is nothing incredible but is also nowhere near as bad as some people are making it out to be while i dont agree with most of brie larsons statements it is a fun watch if you are able to seperate the character from the actor
Mar 21 2019,neutral,there is just so much i didnt like about this movie  the jokes felt like they tried too hard to make them stick  the action scenesexcept for one was so cut up it could have been confettithey didnt do captain marvel justice as they have done for so many marvel films  wonder woman set a high bar for strong female leads  this movie unfortunately fell very short i was entertained in certain parts of the movie but the majority of the movie really made me regret going  im sure the black widow movie will do much better in terms of writing and acting
Mar 21 2019,positive,fantastic couldnt fault it i dont have time to write a pithy nuanced and deeply perceptive review suffice it to say this movie is true to the avengers stable and doesnt disappoint in fact i rate this as one of the best
Mar 21 2019,negative,larson was a terrible actress in this movie
Mar 21 2019,positive,good movie but the fact that fury lost his eye to a cat flerken is a bit underwhelming
Mar 21 2019,positive,have no idea why the 62 audience rating maybe fanboys cant handle a woman captain marvel but this movie rocks  get over it fanboys
Mar 21 2019,positive,i enjoyed the movie but to be fair i am not a troll nor a comic book nazi i felt it told a good story gave some good laughs  and tied several knots my son loved it too
Mar 21 2019,positive,i think it is an exceptional movie i liked the setting i liked her origin it never moves too fast and it never moves too slow its graphicscgi were pretty decent i even preferred them alot more to the thor ragnorak movie graphics i liked the character development carol had in the movie and loved how this movie is filled with funny and heartwarming characters carol also has a strong sense for heroism and always leans to do what is right its admirable she never saves people because she has to but because she wants to i love that about her i also want to mention that this is not a feminist movie that bashes men or generalizes them in anyway as a matter of fact its not even a feminist movie at all gender is not even mentioned there was one scene where the girls where like lets show these men how we do it but thats just it and really i didnt take it as a sense of mockery towards men but instead i took like lets show boys that we can be badass tooso i am always scratching my head when i see articlesreviews saying how this movie was bigoted towards men it really wasnt yes i do have a few complaints there are a few negatives but they arent as bad as people make them out to beor there arent as much as people claim there are my only complaints of the negatives are small and dont affect the overall film the only thing i disliked was the all cats will eventually turn on youshitand the fact thatspoiler that was how fury lost his eye not everything has to be a joke but marvel sometimes pushes it a bit too far i also disliked that they didnt explain her powers a bit morebut i guess that was just a matter of preference and they will probably do that in endgame anyway another complaint i have is the ridiculous bohawk that appears on captain marvel everytime she powers up like what the actual fuck how is that even uggg do her powers tell her what type of hairdo they want causei find that a bit ridiculous and its hard to take her seriously with that hairdo but anyways those were the only negatives i had overall the film is great and entertaining and depicts an actual portrayal of heroism properly
Mar 21 2019,positive,i give the movie a 810 it could have been a 9 or 10 if brie larson wasnâtmt captain marvel when she tried to make jokes it was funny but when any other character made a joke i laughed any else would have been funnier other than that she was perfect for the role humor is not for her
Mar 21 2019,positive,takes awhile to get going but all and all a good movie
Mar 21 2019,positive,finally the first marvel superhero movie starring a female hero has arrived ever since the end of avengers infinity war when nick fury called captain marvel fans have been impatiently waiting for the upcoming captain marvel origin movie release and now it has finally come captain marvel directed by anna boden and ryan fleck is a stunning standalone heroaction movie   captain marvel also known as verscarol danvers is beautifully portrayed by brie larson as a lighthearted carefree loving kind and passionate hero at the beginning of the movie instead of the classic marvel cinematic universe mcu opening it is a touching tribute to stan lee the main founder of marvel who has recently passed away throughout the movie danvers goes on a journey to discover who she was before she came to the kree planet on kree she is trained by yonrogg jude law to become an emotionless warrior hero of the kree planet used to fight the skrulls the krees mortal enemies however danvers could not detach herself from her emotions causing her to stand out amongst the other warriors including her team yonrogg jude law minerva gemma chan bron char rune temte and korath djimon hounsou  after her training scene danvers and her team goes on a dangerous mission that went wrong thus resulting in her capture by the skrulls fortunately she escapes but is stranded on planet c53 also known as earth where she meets young nick fury samuel ljackson while waiting for a rescue team danvers and nick fury depart on a quest to find out who she was before coming to the kree planet   like any other marvel movie there are jokes that will make you chuckle even after the movie has ended badass fight scenes that keep you on the edge of your seat as well as moments that make you experience strong emotions the powers of danvers and other alien tech are presented realistically making brie larson look like she could actually fly and shoot photon blasts from her hands the soundtrack is ingenious because when we listened carefully we noticed that all the songs within the soundtrack were from the early 1990s which is when this movie is depicted overall this movie is thoroughly enjoyable if you love action humor emotions and a lot of superhero poses although because this is a marvel movie integrated into the mcu series i suggest watching the previous marvel movies to better understand the plot of captain marvel otherwise i highly recommend watching this movie and remember always stay till the end to see the two special in credits scene
Mar 21 2019,negative,really underwhelming and doesnt fit the marvel universe film franchise at all overly political its just a pro fem film think the inclusion of captain marvel will probably ruin endgame
Mar 21 2019,negative,3 things matter to me as a viewer seeing something new feeling something and a compelling story i saw nothing new i felt nothing the story was fine acting was pretty poor
Mar 21 2019,neutral,i have finally seen the movie after all the controversy and it has some cool stuff as per normal marvel but ultimately this movie is very generic and bland ben mendelson is the true star of this movie 
Mar 21 2019,neutral,a typical marvel movie with a somewhat disjointed memory loss sub plot and the female empowerment clearly shows in this film
Mar 21 2019,positive,awesome movie a solid marvel outing and my tip to replace iron man as marvels front runner in upcoming phase 4 movies
Mar 21 2019,negative,didnt care for the movie as an origin story it was ok at best not worth the 20 dollars to see the movie seemed like they try to hard
Mar 21 2019,negative,this movie tried to hard to make that strong female lead captain marvel had little of a personality in the film there was a bold amount of feminist propaganda the audience wanted a superheroine movie not a movie that tried to shove females are strong down our throat just comparing this film to wonder woman made it look terrible the main story itself was rather boring i was expecting captain marvel and not at all know how to operate on earth but somehow she knew right of the back on how to drive a motorcycle the pacing seemed to jump everywhere but that was fine at best this movie is ok
Mar 21 2019,negative,its way too forced the story just feels slows in the midpart and in the final act it feels rushed one of marvels worst movies
Mar 21 2019,positive,visually stunning and a great chosen soundtrack marvels formulaic story telling did not change much but having a female superhero with her own movie was very refreshing
Mar 21 2019,positive,fun movie loved the story line the humor and twist
Mar 21 2019,positive,really loved it cant wait to see more in end game
Mar 21 2019,negative,bad script bad actress choice
Mar 21 2019,negative,awful just down to the core never heard of captain marvel before and never want to hear from her again the film was nonsensical babbling with the occasional mediocre fight scene bad film do not watch
Mar 21 2019,positive,after a rocky first act captain marvel eventually takes flight as a joyride until the credits roll
Mar 21 2019,positive,it was another great marvel movie 
Mar 21 2019,negative,i dont like this very much
Mar 21 2019,negative,i tried watching the movie to make my own opinion about it sadly within 20min i wanted to leave brie larsons acting was nothing spectacular and the movie is horrible i am a huge fan of  mcu movies but this one let me down   not worth going to see it at the movie theater
Mar 21 2019,positive,finally i understood why all men love hero movie
Mar 21 2019,neutral,not a great movie like everybody says definitely not like crap i will not buy this movie on dvd nor will i want to ever see this again
Mar 21 2019,negative,i was disappointed not a terrible movie  definitely had a few good scenes however captain marvel was not on par with most other mcu films very worried to hear that captain marvel is going to take the helm in future mcu movies from ironman  captain america 
Mar 21 2019,positive,it was enough action and humor to keep the audiences attention but didnt quite hit the emotional mark that some of the other marvel movies do
Mar 21 2019,positive,pretty damn solid really  brie nailed it
Mar 21 2019,neutral,at least it was better than thor the dark world
Mar 21 2019,negative,after everything ive come to expect from marvel this movie fell way short comparing it to black panther and others is an insult at least samuel l jacksons character was ok to watch but this movie just makes me confused on why it was made and right before end game
Mar 21 2019,negative,went to go see it with a group of friends the beginning was rushed and the story jumped everywhere creating bad pacingit seemed to get better after all the characters were introduced but captain marvel showed little development and was portrayed as a character with no flaws that is not what a superhero should be this was not a good marvel movie
Mar 21 2019,negative,in a wordboring  the movie had no substance  the plot and storyline seemed like it was a rough draft from an early storyboard
Mar 21 2019,neutral,the action was great when it was there took too long to develop for a marvel movie this deep into the mcu larsens snarky outlook was funny and great 12 the time but a bit much the other half if this movie came out in the 90s the feminist overtone would have fit perfectly its 2019 and there was no need to stuff it down our throats wonder woman proved that
Mar 21 2019,negative,boring if not for jackson i would fell asleep after 20 minutes
Mar 21 2019,positive,a fun fresh take on the origins story well cast and well acted
Mar 21 2019,positive,i really enjoyed the film the humor was genuine the fight actions and the cgi were amazing the only thing is that after so many heroes movies the formula is quite bitten
Mar 21 2019,neutral,i really wanted to like this movie but the truth is that captain marvel is a mediocre film at best slowpaced boring plot notsofunny jokes but to me the worst part was the fact that the voice expressions and overall demeanor of brie larson was a complete letdown i felt more connected to talos as a character than to carol and i believe that says a lot i know there has been a lot of controversy around this movie because of the comments of the lead actress but putting all that aside this movie in itself is unfortunately one of marvels worst so far this movie cant even be compared to other femaleled movies like wonder woman and thats just sad other recent movies like alitaand even bumblebee  were much more successful on presenting a female leading role in a way that felt connected to both the story and we the audience when you see wonder woman you simply forget that gal gadot  is an actress you feel like she is wonder woman but when you see captain marvel you are 100 aware at all times that brie larson is just an actress attempting to portrait captain marvel and failing miserably shes just not convincing enough to me this person is simply not captain marvel i really hope they seriously consider doing a recast as they did with the hulk we are talking about a very important figure here the character that is supposed to be be leading the mcu moving forward filling the shoes of rdj who by the way you feel like he is ironman on and off camera i have no doubt that marvel will fix this mess they managed to fix thor 1 and 2 were garbage then they gave us ragnarok and all was good im definitely looking forward to captain marvel 2 but i really and i mean really hope they do a recast and give us a worthy leader of the mcu for the next decade
Mar 21 2019,negative,brie larson is a plank of wood and this movie feels made by committee    only there to service the mcu and nothing more
Mar 21 2019,positive,was a little drawn out and took forever to develop however the second half of the film is really the area where the movie shines worth wild enough to go see story could be worked on a little better but ill take it
Mar 21 2019,neutral,no wonder woman to be sure and not the best of the marvel cinematic universe but entertaining just the same especially the cat stay to the very end of the credits 
Mar 21 2019,positive,a very powerful introduction of carol danvers i loved the film captain marvel is joy to watch
Mar 21 2019,positive,great film makes me want to adopt a firkin or samuel l jackson 
Mar 21 2019,positive,cant say anything bad about this one very enjoyable
Mar 21 2019,neutral,fun but messy ââ feels pitched to a much younger audience than other mcu titles theres no gutwrenching emotion or real depth of character something i think the ensemble mcu movies achieve ââ especially in the supporting roles but instead a whole lot of sassy oneliners larson is really excellent though ââ looking forward to seeing her in other mcu movies innit
Mar 21 2019,positive,brie larson performance is not perfect but human as it is intended soundtrack is a bonus
Mar 21 2019,positive,really loved this movie and left me even more excited for endgame heres to a few more captain marvel solo movies as well
Mar 21 2019,negative,so boring really bad scrip
Mar 21 2019,positive,love it its finally something different
Mar 21 2019,negative,the plot was based on formula and written poorly brie larsons acting was subpar and the feminist sjw messaging was distracting the best part of the film was samuel l jackson i hope captain marvel is only a minor part of endgame
Mar 21 2019,positive,excellent background on nick fury plot twists an much humor the character becomes so powerful however that all other movies about super heroes are just delaying action until captain marvel shows up
Mar 21 2019,negative,just downright bad the acting was terrible and brie has got to be the most annoying and terrible actor ever the best part of the movie was the cat lol dont waste your money on this 
Mar 21 2019,positive,one of the best comic book movies yet 
Mar 21 2019,positive,awesome end game next
Mar 21 2019,positive,excellent movie a great addition to the mcu so much better than i was expecting it shows the power of friendship and never giving up 
Mar 21 2019,positive,while its an origin story weve seen from marvel studios before its still a fun ride brie larson and samuel l jackson have great chemistry together and their scenes together are the best in the movie i loved the nods to 90s action films and and loved the battle in the 3rd act its definitely not the bet mcu installment but its definitely not the worst
Mar 21 2019,positive,solid 3 stars its definitely the worst origin movie the mcu has made but its not unbearable 
Mar 21 2019,neutral,good movie but i feel marvel is trying to push a message not what i watch marvel movies for
Mar 21 2019,negative,an average comic blockbuster
Mar 21 2019,positive,good movie very unique its a connected to infinity wars
Mar 21 2019,negative,i love the mcu and have no problems with female leadroles or feminism that said the movie was kinda boring there was no real suspense emotions no memorable actionscenes no interesting plottwists she came she saw she conquered end of story boring
Mar 21 2019,positive,i think only fragile men with some deep seated issues are panning this    by the way im a man and i loved it were there some call out bread and butter girl powery overtones you bet however i felt like they both failed to eclipse the character and were presented in really organic palatable ways the kind that dont make you feel like you swallowed a bunch of backwash in that last gulp of soda    captain marvel was the shit and i hope people give it a chance
Mar 21 2019,positive,great movie and perfect set up for the next avengers cant wait but dont want it to end either
Mar 21 2019,negative,uninspired and unoriginal carol danvers character portrayal was flat and lifeless there was no growth in the character and quite simply she was boring to watch this movie was certainly an ugly spot on the otherwise great string of recent marvel movies  i would recommend reading a synopsis in lieu of watching this film if you want to stay up to speed for end game
Mar 21 2019,positive,the movie was actually ok not the best but not the worse there was a bit too much toxic masculinity in the movie her dad her fellow pilots some random guy on a bike she stole so it is a feminist film that needs to buck up the female character by placing her along side the worst of men in fact i dont think there are any good white men in the whole movie
Mar 21 2019,negative,it was pretty boring
Mar 21 2019,negative,brie larson really connects with samuel jackson in this film and their chemistry is great however she fails to connect to a majority of the audience after her its not made for you comments if i am to talk strickly about the movie it self it is bland and nothing but a stepping stone to get closer to endgame
Mar 21 2019,negative,this just wasnt very good it wasnt good either it was a pretty average movie
Mar 21 2019,positive,as a lifelong ms marvel fan i love this movie the character was fantastic and the changes from the comics werent too dramatic but kept with the spirit of the mcu great female relationships in this movie as well entertaining overall with lots of action and nerdy references my new favorite marvel movie
Mar 21 2019,positive,the story was straight forward and easy to understand and the twist was a shock i was instantly attached to all the characters on screen something that is rare for me but everyone just fit their roles so well     it felt like no one was above the other so much connection that i cant picture a scene being removed without thinking how it would change the momentum of the story    mcucarol is not who i imagined and that is what makes the movie great she starts out with the rookie mindset moves to detective and later a empathetic being and hero i can only hope that endgame has taken this into account
Mar 21 2019,positive,it isnt the best marvel movie but it was far from the worst  it had a lot of the same feeling as thor i to me for context thor is by far my favorite character in the mcu and i prefer his solo movies to the others although dark world was less that great
Mar 20 2019,positive,loved every second of it
Mar 20 2019,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed the film while its true that captain marvel falls short along with its peers in the latter part of the mcu we have to remember that this is supposed to be a prelude and origin story of how the avengers initiative was made     captain marvel didnt waste time trying to get the audience know about how carol danvers became captain marvel it went straight to the action and gave us glimpses and clues how she became the superhero she is today     another thing i enjoyed was how nick fury had been humanized how it was shown that like many people in the workforce we had all been through that phase where we are chipper with work more relaxed and not uptight comparing how nick fury is in his later years you would know that the more relaxed and laidback nick fury became a hardened soldier upon the establishment of the avengers     i also enjoyed the amounts of easter eggs the movie had that linked captain marvel to the other mcu movies and i spent the whole time going oh damn when things started clicking in     dont judge cm based on phase 3 of the mcu its a phase 1 movie released in phase 3 and serves as a prelude to end game
Mar 20 2019,positive,the movie allnall is good but i stop at that grade it seemed more informational for the next avenger movie than anything
Mar 20 2019,positive,i think that the final fight needed to be way harder she really just breezed through it
Mar 20 2019,positive,i liked it as a marvel movie but there was a genuine lack of comedy and less action but story line was okay
Mar 20 2019,negative,forced comedy didnt work everyone tells carol to control her anger yet the actor doesnt show any emotion at all trash movie who is only praised because the main character is a girl
Mar 20 2019,positive,the movie started slow and felt a bit bored the movie did get better it was nice to see furry in action 
Mar 20 2019,negative,could have been great but captain marvel wasnt an intriguing character very disappointed flat lines and worse jokes i was hoping for more in addition the narrative was too forced when you tell a story with a point dont try to force feed it let it play naturally
Mar 20 2019,positive,a total blast of retro fun for the whole family
Mar 20 2019,negative,any credit that actually gave this film a positive review needs to learn to code complete hack job dont bother wasting your time with this one
Mar 20 2019,negative,it was one of the most boring of the mcu films not saying it was a flop but where was the humor i wanted to like this movie i was so excited for it i thought if dcs wonder woman could kick so much ass after the crappy movies they spat out imagine what marvel could do for black widow or rogue or in this case captain freaking marvel instead we got really dumb jokes that didnâtmt do more than cause a snicker and a main character that wasnâtmt nearly as interesting as every other character standing beside her in most of the mcu movies i felt excited or giddy or nervous during them that didnâtmt happen once during this film for me how do you make a fight scene boring how
Mar 20 2019,positive,i really enjoyed this and thought it was a great lead into end game
Mar 20 2019,positive,brie larsons performance was overall flat and boring i could get more charisma from kristen stewart simply the wrong person cast for this role
Mar 20 2019,neutral,brie larson kills the movie with poor acting she seems  detached from the character with random whoooos during what should be stressful situations samual jackson did a  good job without him the movie would have been a bust
Mar 20 2019,positive,we thought the movie was much better than expected and ties in perfectly with the next avengers there was plenty of action and never a dull moment in the storyline 
Mar 20 2019,neutral,i wanted to like this movie i really did ive read some of the comics and captain marvel is one of my favorite heroes but the movie while fun felt underwhelming it just didnt feel like the best that marvel could do and that makes me sad because i really bought into the hype that captain marvel was this great empowering movie which to be fair it was in a few scenes    i liked brie larson as carol danvers but the movie didnt seem to know what to do with her i think it had like 5 writers im sure that contributed to its odd pacing misplaced humor and inconsistent storytelling    btw everyone was right goose is great
Mar 20 2019,negative,we went to see it with with no background or expectations we left shaking our heads and wishing we choose another film the lead actress was one dimensional one emotion the chaotic beginning bad jokes dull storyline and silly dialogue made this unbearable only jackson was worth watching
Mar 20 2019,negative,captain marvel seem so bored every line just lack some emotion
Mar 20 2019,positive,loved this movie  iâtmve never really been that interested in marvel movies but after seeing this in theaters i decided to watch all of them from the beginning to catch up for avengers endgame
Mar 20 2019,positive,wow  outstanding additional to marvel universe  a real treat  i wanted to add a bit more to this review having watched this a second time on dvd originally in the theater  i am very aware of the critiques of some fans about sjw or identity politics being injected into movies in an over the top kind of way and that has also been said of this movie  however i consider that those elements are very subtle the story line arc and plot of this movie make sense it is visually appealing and while the kreeskrull war could be utilized much better and expanded on and i hope it will in the future this movie still stands as a great visual treat with a good story line plot and a good overall message  i agree that in some movies today a political agenda right or left forced down an audiences throat is not a good idea at the expense of good film making i just dont think its the case here and i recommend the movie
Mar 20 2019,neutral,among the weaker of the marvel gems thor 2 iron man 3 any hulk 
Mar 20 2019,positive,a great movie with a great hero very entertaining with some amazing action scenes and a mindblowing soundtrack with hits from 90s including nirvana no doubt and much more
Mar 20 2019,negative,captain marvel the review    i dont even know where to begin when it comes to rating this movie on a scale of good or bad the best word i can use to describe it is awkward    lots of really questionable editing choices throughout this film you never truly get a feel for the scope of the story or the world it takes place in the flashback scenes in particular are not used effectively and their inclusion into the movie feels disjointed many of the editing cuts dont feel organic giving the entire movie a sense that something feels off    the musical score is so inconspicuous you likely wont even know there is one there is no captain marvel themeatleast not any   that you will notice no themes at all just background prattle that goes unnoticed    regarding the supposed feminist agenda in this movie it is largely a nonissue for the most part the media hyping the identity aspects of the film should be ashamed of themselves for claiming this is some sort of inspiration narrative the push to make this a watershed moment in our culture are a complete manufacturing of the media promoting it as such the trailer promoting captain marvel as a hero is more puissant than anything in the actual movie     there is a sliver of this girls can do it to theme sprinkled throughout the story but they are so unexplored and unimpactful that it leaves little impression at all if anything the story   could have benefited from some strong theme or ideal to drive the   motivation of the main character as it is now any motivation at all feels muted    captain marvel as a character is dull uninteresting and not very compelling there is no charisma at all  brie larson was clearly miscast in this role or at very least misdirected the script does not work in her favor and there is no synergy between them   sometimes it feels like everyone on screen is more intriguing than   the main character    we are repeatedly told in this movie that captain marvel needs to control her emotions but we never see this displayed anywhere in the story there is no payoff to this character theme we never see this character flaw and we never see it overcome character   and personality seem to be something this script lacks     this movie makes several attempts at capturing that marvel style humor and it falls flat at every turn from scripting to delivery it fails at humor    the much hailed 90s nostalgia is largely superficial and you really start to question why it wasnt set in the present day setting it in the past leaves more questions and leaps in logic than it provides in merit    this does not feel like the 1990s at all you will see many things from the 90s shoved into many scenes but nothing feels authentic all the dialogue feels very modern and typical of any movie you would see today nothing distinctive about the 90s is on   display here in any meaningful way    while the main plot is typical of marvel the story is not told in an engaging way and little about the entire scope of the characters world is explored the ongoing war between the kree and skrull is at the center of the plot but nothing about it is   really explained we learn nothing about why they are fighting or what their motivations are in the larger war the whole conflict boils down to we need to find the macguffin    the movie also betrays the very concept of the war from the source   material by portraying one side as sympathetic and oppressed and   the other as power hungry and manipulative they have completely   stripped the conflict of its more interesting complexities the whole point was supposed to be that neither side is truly more right or wrong than the other that is what makes it interesting    while it is a comic book movie and we can expect a little suspension of disbelief it would be nice if we could atleast get an explanation for how things work in this world     how do captain marvels powers work what are their limits     where do her powers come from a lightspeed engine explodes and the energy is somehow absorbed how does an engine give her kree blood did the kree inject her with it in a deleted scene did the engine give her kree blood because the kree built it     as far as the rest of the cast everyone else is mostly fine samuel l jackson is who you expect him to be both jude law and ben mendelsohn perform acceptably with what they are given     the worst thing about the movie is that it really is uneventful and forgettable there is little here that will likely be needed to enjoy the upcoming avengers endgame i would actually wager captain marvels introduction in that movie will probably be far more entertaining without the needless and trivial backstory presented here    overall its a shallow uninspired and mediocre hollywood product of our time meh id give a 2 out of 5 i guess    ps if captain marvel is the face of the mcu going forward the future has a very boring face
Mar 20 2019,positive,while not the most overly dramatic or wacky marvel film certainly one of my favorites knitting together the cosmic and earth based narratives of the mcu captain marvel is the perfect preamble to the next chapter of the mcu by first stepping back into its own history brie larson plays captain marvel with the duality of a stoic goofiness which is one of the most down to earth so to speak  and human performances of an mcu film all around solid film that certainly will become a classic of marvel studios
Mar 20 2019,positive,i was pleasantly surprised by how much i enjoyed this film 85 out of 10 for me
Mar 20 2019,negative,i almost liked this movie there were fleeting moments of excitement caused by the colorful scifi action and nostalgic setting but i was never immersed in the story i liked carol danvers but i was unable to sympathize with her plight because i never really understood her conflict she was unable to user her powers due to a mechanical inhibitor not because of some personal flaw she had to to overcome the obstacles she faced felt forced and generic to top it all off the surprise twist at the end felt more like a cheap trick very forgettable
Mar 20 2019,positive,great movie dont know why the trolls are giving it bad reviews
Mar 20 2019,positive,this is a movie for all girls geeks or not all of us are powerful and amazing even without superpowers  thanks marvel
Mar 20 2019,positive,fantastic fun flick  
Mar 20 2019,positive,being another movie that is way back in time you should pay attention it also helps if you paid attention to the marvel universe on abc shows as well as the movies
Mar 20 2019,negative,searching for laughsnope not sure if i fell asleep or just lost interest from star trek to the old men in black   
Mar 20 2019,positive,good enterntaining movie it falters in some obvious aspects but a good middle of the pack for the mcu and a good origin story has a lot of heart and messages that are positives next one is bound to be better
Mar 20 2019,positive,loved this movie left feeling like i wanted to see it again immediately very empowering brie was great
Mar 20 2019,positive,good movie that continues the mcu story and has excellent interactions between carol danvers and nick fury
Mar 20 2019,negative,fair at best  the writing was stale compared to any other marvel movies  the actual story was fair and also boring  how on earth did rt give it a 79  ill go with the audience score of 62
Mar 20 2019,negative,you could skip this one it was kinda blah
Mar 20 2019,positive,it was amazing  had great comedic timing natural dialogue and a starstudded cast who did a fantastic job
Mar 20 2019,negative,very loose when connected to its comic origins which sits with me wrong mainly her powers organ and durability through the movie was completely inaccurate then the main actress gave has literally two faces through the whole movie thats it so that left us with very little to the connect to
Mar 20 2019,negative,just a very very weird movie captain marvel and nick fury are really the only two characters that donâtmt make me laugh all other characters are either used terribly or are just so bad that youâtmll want to leave captain marvel is an extremely powerful character and should play a big role in avengers endgame but if the upcoming captain marvel movies are anything like this then count me out 25 stars
Mar 20 2019,negative,this is the worst movie ever done by marvel its a combo between a bad alien movie and 70s cop show
Mar 20 2019,negative,an absolutely pretentious waste of time poor acting poorly written dialogue and hellishly poor scripting have made this movie one of the worse cinematic experiences of the twentyfirst century brie larson is an amateur at best and a total hack at worst i dont even know if ill watch endgame due to how horrid boring and pretentious this film is you have lost a fan today marvel
Mar 20 2019,positive,the best marvel movie since the last one
Mar 20 2019,neutral,first everything good  great special effects  great supporting cast    now everything notsogood  ill go ahead and say it larsen was a bad casting choice watching her was like trying to watch a glass of milk act she had zero emotional range and every line delivery was exactly the same as every other line delivery shes just not a goodenough actor to play this part marvel normally does really well with their castings not sure what happened here but if they decide to replace her after this next movie i wont have any complaints about it    still in regard to the actor though not in regard to the acting her physical presence in the film is incredibly underwhelming captain marvel is supposed to be a powerhouse shes imposing and powerful and intimidating larsen is a waifish bobblehead with noodlearms that looks like she couldnt fight her way out of a wet paper bag the only reason shes impressive at all is because she has superpowers take away those powers and shes a waifish bobblehead with noodlearms who couldnt benchpress a beagle    i had the same concern when i heard gal gadot was cast as wonderwoman but then she got into the gym and packed on a bunch of muscle so that she would actually look the part and she did a great job i was shocked at how well she did and i wasnt too proud to admit i was wrong about her im absolutely 100 not wrong about larsen she looks like shes probably never worked out a day in her life and has no physical presence in the movie whatsoever i was genuinely hoping she would pull a gal gadot but she didnt she failed    storywise there were a lot of problems very big problems     i could rant quite a while longer on all the plot holes and all the other things that just dont make sense but i have better things to do overall i will say it was an okay movie not great i didnt necessarily regret watching it i just wish it was better and it could have been
Mar 20 2019,positive,i love this movie all my fanboy and gamer friends hate it but i plan on seeing it again tomorrow and again this weekend with my brother one of my friends thinks it is unfair that captain marvel has no fatal flaw misquoting  jessica rabbit from who framed roger rabbit âsheâtms just made that wayâ    captain marvel is a hero she is a hero for women and for men i love this film and i will be looking forward to the sequel
Mar 20 2019,positive,best movie and long live stan lee 
Mar 20 2019,positive,i enjoyed the film it wasnt a masterpiece but a great introduction to the character
Mar 20 2019,positive,samuel l jacksons strong performance did not conceal the weak plot brie larsons acting left a lot to be desired this movie overplayed feminism but failed to resonate the same level of enthusiasm like the wonder woman
Mar 20 2019,positive,solid but not marvels best i still look forward to seeing the character again though
Mar 20 2019,positive,my favorite movie franchise is marvel by far and i love what the marvel administration and actorsactresses have done with the organization even though captain marvel was not the best  marvel movie ever created it was still a great movie that explained the origin of the first avengers movie and the movie introduced one of the most powerful characters into the universe if you call yourself a marvel fan then this movie is a must see because of its correlation to endgame i recommend this movie to a audience no older than 30 overall great contribution to the marvel universe
Mar 20 2019,negative,poor acting and a poor script clearly this film used its platform to push its agenda with the main character and the skrulls we need an escape from this garbage and that is why we go to the movies
Mar 20 2019,negative,probably the worst one in recent marvel history
Mar 20 2019,negative,i wanted to like this movie but it failed on so many levels
Mar 20 2019,positive,i saw the movie yesterday and really enjoy it it has alot of action and i really like how the movie turn out brie larson does a great job playing captain marvel i cant wait to see her in avengers endgame
Mar 20 2019,positive,not what i expected but really good
Mar 20 2019,negative,this movie was fun in forms with samuel l jackson bringing in the main bulk of comedy that freshened up the movie otherwise i felt no sense of correlation proper explanation or in shorter terms a decent story     brie larsons performance felt monotone and that of which it felt like she didnt want to be playing the role her try at comedy was subpar at best and in places where she was supposed to show large amounts of emotion it fell flat    the numerous retcons in the movie that entirely replaced already established lore were also subpar compared to the original lore    overall this movie needed much more time and production and an actress who suited the role better than brie larson did
Mar 20 2019,negative,omg its soo bad it doesnt even tell the reason why she wasnt in the first avengers
Mar 20 2019,positive,really enjoyed the movie it was just as good as other past marvel movies 
Mar 20 2019,positive,thank you so so much for this movie i donâtmt think the ads did it justice because i kind of thought i wouldnâtmt like it but my goodness i loved it it was so inspiring and i loved the diverse representation of the cast and it definitely brought me to tears a couple of times it was fun and actionpacked and i really enjoyed it also orange cat
Mar 20 2019,positive,its a good film based on the comics
Mar 20 2019,neutral,i absolutely love marvel movies and the action and innovation that they bring to cinematic experience with that being said this is truly one of the worst marvel movies made its not a bad movie its just an okay movie but its a c grade marvel movie it seems like it was created solely to set up and explain in avengers infinity war and the sequel to follow infinity war i dont know what other purpose the movie served they had samuel jackson looking amazing as young with all the screen time that he had it was almost flawless the only thing that i could see that was off was the size of his head but if you like marvel movies its i watch for you but i dont think paying for it in the theater did everything for me im glad that i have amc stubs a list because i would have really been upset that i pay my money to see this in imax
Mar 20 2019,negative,mediocre at best it was just a step toward the next avengers movie and nothing more honestly i thought that brie larson was miscast the story was weak and predictable and i was more interested in the origin story of fury  coulson than i was with captain marvel
Mar 20 2019,positive,if you dont care about all the discussions about the female power bluh bluh bluh outside of the theater the movie itself is pretty decent has its twist makes you smile and nod here and there and provides a good nostalgia to the 90s its a good marvel movie in my book
Mar 20 2019,negative,just wasnâtmt that enjoyable felt like a setup for endgame instead of a cool origin story for captain marvel
Mar 20 2019,negative,the weakest movie of the marvel mcu weak story weak plot the only good thing is samuel l jackson
Mar 20 2019,negative,mostly standard stuff over the top effects that borrow more than a little from dragon ball z would have been much better if was released after endgame but doesnt really fit where it is and is a little late to introduce a new character halfway through the final story in the penultimate conclusion to a 10 year marvel story
Mar 20 2019,positive,it definitely wasnt a perfect movie but my sister and i had a great time when we went and saw it last night there are plenty of fun moments
Mar 20 2019,positive,good comic book movie with a nice twist
Mar 20 2019,positive,fun fast and all round a great film
Mar 20 2019,negative,pretty generic film probably the worst of the mcu films
Mar 20 2019,positive,the whole family enjoyed it it was funny and we liked the story line many connections made finally 
Mar 20 2019,positive,powerful movie carol danvers goes from unsure of herself in the face of all the men who patronize her and tell her shes not good enough and that her approach to the world is wrong because its different from hers to embracing her own power  must see for every woman who has ever doubted herself
Mar 20 2019,neutral,good and bad  for 2 weeks prior to seeing it all i had heard about was all the commotion leading up to it  so i walked in fearing the worst  i was pleasantly surprised though  it was a fun movie  but there were some definite bad points  it all came down to this the writing team should be fired its a shame that there was so much clout about mcu finally getting a female solo movie and is being celebrated as such a liberating strong female breaker of boundaries yet the writing team just simply didnt understand how to deliver that  the list of strong female lead characters in cinema all the way back as far as i can remember may not be quite as big as i would like but there are still so many that are amazing  complex  badass  but this team writes like untalented adolescents  seriously some of the dialogue is cringeworthy and there are moments of i hope the audience doesnt question how we went from point a to point b but the worst aspect was that they didnt allow for her to be complex  they made her 2dimensional didnt allow for her to develop and never made anything much of a challenge  its the same reason ive never been a fan of superman  the only time hes fun to watch is when he fights someone even stronger than himself  there has to be high stakes or else it gets boring real quickly  they were so eager to show how powerful captain marvel was that they neglected to make her endearing  they methodically put all the formulaic ingredients that the other wellloved movies contained but seemed to lack the artistic insight on how to organize  utilize  polish them into a gem  this was supposed to be such a win for women everywhere and so the producers shouldve put the best writing team together in order to make it a truly epic masterpiece  but it was just entertaining that being said there was a lot i did like  cool fights great special effects some good characters fury  the skrull leader were great the cat was awesome a lot of the humor made me laugh  glad i got to see it
Mar 20 2019,neutral,overall it  was just thor dark world good  its not on the same level as black panther captain america winter soldier iron man or guardians of the galaxy
Mar 20 2019,positive,a fun actionpacked heartwrenching redemptive story full of twists and turns and absolute fun  brie larson does a killer job along with a younger samuel jackson  their partnership in the movie is the stuff of buddycop movies  it ties together the past with the present of the marvel franchise along with a killer 90s soundtrack and wardrobe that brings back nostalgia  it has well placed laughs as well something marvel excels at in stride a truly enjoyable film that will stand among the better of marvels movies an easy 4 stars
Mar 20 2019,positive,this had everything i want a marvel movie to have action heart and a few laughs
Mar 20 2019,positive,good but it just seemed there was something missing it was a good set up movie for the avengers endgame an ok movie by itself 
Mar 20 2019,negative,pretty mediocre movie did not enjoyed it
Mar 20 2019,positive,the best marvel movie yet the story the pacing the balance of action and humor all were outstanding brilliant movie brilliant acting wonderful experience
Mar 20 2019,negative,this was by far the worst marvel movie no real story of substance the character overcame nothing really and we were given no real reason to care about her the âbad guysâ in this movie were the real stars along with samuel jackson
Mar 20 2019,positive,fun movie not sure what everyone was complaining about
Mar 20 2019,neutral,it was an ok film but heavily over exaggerated for an mcu film the acting was meh special effects were on point but that is to be expected for a film before endgame i am disappointed the amount of marketing this film got and all the hype really didnt do it justice
Mar 20 2019,negative,just not a good movie  not worth seeing
Mar 20 2019,negative,just another garbage super hero movie with every cliche in the book please make it stop
Mar 20 2019,positive,â too slowpaced in the middle   â more action scenes once carol discovers her ultimate power would be nice     â however the action scenes were exciting specifically at the end
Mar 20 2019,positive,wasnt sure what to expect given the mild reviews but it was an entertaining 2hrs at the movies  good action good story nice character development and a good addition to the mcu  the girlpower and humour fit nicely in and wasnt overdone was it easily could have been forced
Mar 20 2019,negative,it was an entertaining movie but they took alot of creative liberty the film seemed rush and instead of it being a feminist movie by her just being a bad ass they decided to keep cramming it down our throat lots of plot holes as well overall they could have done a much better with this movie instead ththeththey took a character who has been rebooted several times in the comicsbecause she just isnt a popular character this also just seemed like a rush to get a female into the mcu and chose a character that no one wanted black widow would have made a much better stand alone movie
Mar 20 2019,positive,one of the more disappointing mcu movies but it still is far from terrible fantastic cgi some great fight scenes and a solid performance from samuel l jackson the script is horrendous in some parts and tries to shove things when they do not fit into the context whatsoever while the soundtrack has some great moments it feels out of place in some of the more intense moments captain marvel also did some things that were not necessary whatsoever ie the way nick fury loses his eye and naming the avenger project after captain marvels nickname some dumb choices but the movie is fun
Mar 20 2019,positive,a solid entertaining entry into the super hero genre
Mar 20 2019,positive,entertaining origin story that fit well into the mcu leading up to endgame
Mar 20 2019,neutral,lacks emotion its not intense and the main actress simply doesnt have any charisma
Mar 20 2019,positive,a good origin movie but not the best i like it in the overall maybe fury could be a little more badass
Mar 20 2019,positive,great film  i loved it as did my 12 yearold grandson its good to see a film with a woman as the hero and so well done i would see it again
Mar 20 2019,positive,a lot of action and touches of humor give a good rhythm to a powerful story that tells the background of carol danvers also we have a little more history about fury and it leaves us ready for avengers endgame
Mar 20 2019,positive,amazing film and a marvelous  addition to the mcu wonderful character development and special effects so impressed with the cinematography
Mar 20 2019,positive,my second favorite marvel movie ever really loved brie larson in this role
Mar 20 2019,positive,i liked it  i had no real expectations for this movie other than i am just a big fan of all the rest of the mcu content  i dont know anything about captain marvel comics  i am exactly the type of person that should be upset by the comments made by brie larsen but let me say this its not really a thing in this movie  this is just a case of an actor with a platform expressing her opinions on things  nothing new here    the movie is done well  i liked the humor i liked the story i liked the actions  all on par with what weve come to expect from mcu entries  looking forward to more  this entry is not my favorite mcu entry but its not the worst either  its somewhere in the middle and i thoroughly enjoyed it
Mar 20 2019,positive,really enjoyed it funny charming and overall a good watch enjoyed seeing behind the scenes clips of the filmmaking process on social media too iâtmd highly recommend 
Mar 20 2019,negative,the film ultimately feels like an after thought while some parts were engaging the majority felt bland and uninteresting the major issue is that captain marvel is intended to be a role model for girls yet she regularly usurps authority destroys public and private property and demonstrates a typically selfish and unthoughtful personality 23 of the way through the film however she turns into a totally different person just a poorly written and executed after thought
Mar 20 2019,positive,captain marvel is an enjoyable addition to the mcu however it also has a lot of issues which cannot be ignored     the film does do well in certain elements the effects are obviously excellent especially in the work done to deage samuel l jackson and the prosthetics on the skrulls some of the action is also well done such as the opening fight on board the skrull ship and the chase scene involving the train i also found the twist involving the skrulls to be a welcome addition which was genuinely unexpected for me a rarity within the film and overall created a more emotionally investing aspect of narrative which had yet to be successfully introducedit also hopefully will give some nuance to the skrull race if they are to return as villains at a later stage during a possible secret invasion storyline presenting both the good and evil aspects of a race and society which is always an interesting exploration     beyond this one plot twist however the overall film was very predictable in every other sense whilst the supporting cast did very well and worked well with brie larson with some good chemistry and emotional beats for them which really worked well notably ben mendelson and lashana lynch the same cannot be said for captain marvel herself she was entertaining alongside some of these more interesting sidecharacters and provided some nice snarky quips but beyond this on her own she comes across as rather bland and an absolutely missed opportunity the film sets up the idea right in the opening scene that carol is âtoo emotionalâ and jude lawâtms character states this to be the reason why she will fail and repeats this notion throughout the entire film despite this carol finds she has been fighting an unjust war for 6 years realises her entire life is a lie realises she lost her previous happy life and had that stolen from her and finds out that her friends are actually her captors all of which results in not a single genuine emotional moment from her giving her an emotional reaction of anger despair selfdoubt as a reaction to any of these would have made her much more interesting likeable and memorable and would have made for a far superior narrative    this lack of payoff in her emotions even then extends to the action in the third act in which she could have used these emotions within the final fight she could have showed her enemies and the audience that her emotions are her strength and put all of her built up pain into that final fight scene making for a much more impactful third act and could have allowed her to reach the full potential of her powers  i also understand that given that she is to be the most powerful hero in the mcu so far it would be difficult to give her a villain who could genuinely go toe to toe with her at full capacity but there was easily a way to still have an interesting struggle for her to overcome whilst also demonstrating her power within the final act for instance instead of fighting off the supreme intelligence first and then fighting her former allies with her full powers why not have both happen at the same time this would mean she had to balance fighting a mental and physical battle at the same time showing her strength in both ways whilst still putting her at a severe disadvantage to both justifying her struggle against them side note this would also involve a much more interesting battle with the supreme intelligence beyond walking through a blue beam blandly     overall captain marvel is an entertaining yet disappointing addition to the mcu which sports a good supporting cast and story with a lead who sadly seems to have been written to be as uninteresting and detrimental to the impact of the narrative as possible essentially captain marvel would have been a lot better if it werenâtmt for captain marvel    35
Mar 20 2019,negative,worst mcu movie other than the original hulk
Mar 20 2019,neutral,probably the least likeable movie of all the mcu movies  character is dry and you never empathize with her because of her anger or constant lecturing of why she is a bad assover the top unnecessary    cmon marvel  this aint the strongest hero in the mcu  thor and hulk would pulverize carroll without all the lecturing and posturing    i hope she doesnt derail endgame
Mar 20 2019,positive,entertaining refreshing looking forward to more
Mar 20 2019,negative,unwatchable  only redeeming quality came from nick fury  bri larson is such a poor actress it hurt
Mar 20 2019,positive,great fun movie  definitely check it out
Mar 20 2019,neutral,i was really disappointed with this movie the pacing was off and pretty much stayed the same throughout the jokes were bad and very few of them landed and the plot twist was predictable i felt like it was trying so hard to be a woman empowerment movie that it took itself too seriously and stopped being a marvel movie black panther and the animated spiderman movie did a much better job combining an inspiring message comedy and story into a film
Mar 20 2019,positive,my 5 kids and me loved it higher faster stronger bby
Mar 20 2019,positive,had some fun moments and a good finish to lead into end game 
Mar 20 2019,positive,its good  but its not as great as it could be goose steals most of the show d and theres an excellent twist  quite hard doing anything new these days but all in all its a great filler while we wait for endgame
Mar 20 2019,negative,for a marvel movie it was meh
Mar 20 2019,neutral,it was fine good in parts boring in others below par for a marvel movie
Mar 20 2019,positive,my wife and i went to see captain marvel last night  we both came out of the theater feeling that the movie was pretty darn good    the movie was not the best in the mcu but it was nowhere near the worst  the movie lacked something that i couldnt put my finger on  i certainly didnt dislike it  instead i just didnt quite fill drawn in and at some points it felt contrived     regardless i thought the actress brie larson did a fine job as well as samuel jackson      the movie didnt push the girl power theme like many audience critics claimed  instead it showed a person who rose up and became something greater in spite of the obstacles in her life    was the movie a critical component of the mcu and to the endgame movie  i dont know  but if you are an mcu fan  watch it  you will like it
Mar 20 2019,positive,ok movie had the special effects graphic design and scenery of a marvel movie but the plotline fell short and the main actor was dull the movie had great action scenes and funny moments but it was preety meh at times
Mar 20 2019,positive,i found the humor funny and i was able to keep up with the plot although my younger brother had some problems with that but as a newcomer i really love how all the actors did and the twist with the skulls i really hope they make more movies like this
Mar 20 2019,positive,not nearly as great as the hype around it but still a very solid mcu origin story that adds more intrigue to the upcoming avengers endgame
Mar 20 2019,negative,the same old story lacked intuition of any kind
Mar 20 2019,positive,captain marvel is more than a worthy addition to the marvel cinematic universe its a bold step forward for inclusion the storied franchise black panther started the party for more diversity in the mcu and though the argument could be made that black widow shouldve gotten her movie before an mcu newbie got a starring role captain marvel is a great first step like other mcu origin movies the amount of exposition needed affects the movies pacing in the middle acts but the beginning and last third of the movie are stellar jackson larson mendelssohn and lashana lynch are fantastic and jude laws friendturnedfoe is wellscripted and wellacted mcu canon will have a hard time balancing danvers power level relative to the other superheroes but man i cant wait to see what carol has in store for thanos
Mar 20 2019,neutral,definitely feels like a phase one film very sloppy and more concerned with an agenda then being apart of the mcu op character done poorly i wouldnt be surprised if you dont need to see it to know why shes in endgame
Mar 20 2019,positive,easily one of the best marvel origin movies it had good comedy action scenes and plot line too many people went in with expectations of well i donâtmt know what they were expecting but they may not have been happy with it but i think itâtms mostly because theyâtmre butthurt 1010 would see this again
Mar 20 2019,neutral,not terrible but not great standard disney marvel forced formula the feel is very much like antman and the wasp brie larsons performance is hard to buy and hard to connect to but its not really her fault the onus lies more on disney who deformed the marvel comics canon by combining two legendary characters into one and putting their own spin statement on it hence a lack of a substantial origin story dont go into this with high expectations but rather see it as another supporting piece for avengers endgame disney did pay a nice tribute to stan lee and samuel l jackson was good as always 
Mar 20 2019,negative,the acting was borderline mediocre with a overly political actor maybe the movie wasnt for me because im a white male
Mar 20 2019,negative,its ok nothing great watch it online free
Mar 20 2019,negative,women deserve a better hero than this the lead is very rarely heroic rarely exhibits anything approaching charisma the story is entirely uninspiring and the comedy falls flat movies like this will ruin marvel as even fairly die hard fans like myself are going to lose faith
Mar 20 2019,positive,not sure what hate was about overall very good and fun movie some minor complaints but would definitely watch again
Mar 20 2019,positive,this was my favorite avengers movie of all time 
Mar 20 2019,negative,i was hoping for a better movie so we could get hyped to her in endgame but it just feels really bland
Mar 20 2019,positive,slow at first but was really good kind of felt like the whole movie would have been over once she recovered her memories and i know i lot of people are starting to feel that mcu origins movies are starting to feel repetitive
Mar 20 2019,negative,im a big fan of the mcu but this movie was the worst one so far  to be honest i was not able to build up any relationship with the main role she was not smart like ironman or fighting for a certain ideology hello cpt america as well you dont get any idea why the main ki was even starting the war and what the main goal of her is maybe this is the main story than for the second film  one more point what i found a little bit annoying was that the humor of marvel was little bit to much during the mid of the movie when cpt marvel and fury met the first time
Mar 20 2019,negative,tries to push feminist propaganda 
Mar 20 2019,positive,fun twists great chemistry between characters specifically larson and sam jackson overall really fun
Mar 20 2019,negative,terribly forced character with unnatural traits in a universe where she has no continuum also really bad directing
Mar 20 2019,negative,visually fantastic as all mcu movies are these day tho some of the of the shots of marvel flying in space were really rough  i cant say that the movie blew me away tho and cant believe that they have moved so far away from the source material as to make the skrulls as they are shown here guess thats one less story possibility for future fantastic four stories in terms of antagonists were they trying to make some sort of political statement regarding this because if that is the case perhaps that is why it fell flat with me i really am tired of the preaching from my entertainment especially from a class of people that are so far removed from the reality of most of our lives  my guess is avengers endgame has sheltered this movie from low viewer turnout but quite honestly you dont really need to see this movie nothing in it is important for how the infinity war will be resolved
Mar 20 2019,negative,i was specting a lot more from this movie as a captain marvel fan especially from a 2019 movie
Mar 20 2019,positive,empowering film packed with action and a fantastic resolution to boot also a killer soundtrack marvel really smashed it with this one
Mar 20 2019,neutral,too much cgi but story is important for the avergers
Mar 20 2019,negative,it sucked mediocre like it has no soul compared to the other marvel movies this is a shame what happened
Mar 20 2019,negative,i am no white male but gotta tell you the move is quite boring
Mar 20 2019,negative,just a generic origin super hero movie but it couldve been better some wasted potential and just felt flat
Mar 20 2019,positive,absolutely amazing movie best origin story i think out of any of the marvel movies there were maybe 1 or 2 scenes i thought were unnecessary but for the most part the entire film was put together well and was a lot of fun glad to see a badass heroine movie
Mar 20 2019,negative,dull predictable uninspired very disappointed
Mar 20 2019,positive,captain marvel was a fine movie it suffers from the same problem as black panther in that all of the side characters are more interesting than the main hero also this was one of the less humorous films in the mcu but not necessarily because they tried to be more serious a lot of the jokes just didnâtmt land that being said this was an overall enjoyable film especially the last bit when captain marvel starts doing her thing as mentioned before all of the side characters are fun too with nick fury maria rambeau and even the skrull general talos were the best parts of the film for me besides goose who is awesome
Mar 19 2019,positive,amazing movie loops so many things together
Mar 19 2019,negative,worst mcu movie all around bad in every aspect brie larson is like watching a piece of lumber totally bored the superhero thing isnt for her wonder woman is light years better
Mar 19 2019,positive,one of the better marvel movies    if your a marvel fan then it is worth seeing just for the stan lees final cameo and tribute
Mar 19 2019,positive,it was ok  i think im getting burned out on super hero movies  after all the negative things that happen in the press prior to the release racism sexism really had an effect on my expectations going in
Mar 19 2019,positive,much better than the infinity wars
Mar 19 2019,positive,marvel does it again as usual but with a little twist of their own their sometimes unique spin on things has been widely accepted however this time it seems to be getting more back lash i believe the movie was well done and stayed on track for endgame even explains a few unasked but good to know answers it was fun exciting and visually stunning another home run for marvel
Mar 19 2019,positive,samuel l jackson steals the show the work of his deaging was fantastic brie larsonâtms performance was a little dull and disappointing sometimes but she overall did a great job nick fury losing his eye to goose was fucking stupid though
Mar 19 2019,positive,solid film i really enjoyed it
Mar 19 2019,negative,probably the most boring movie iâtmve ever seen but i did love the stan lee part of it so iâtmm giving it a star
Mar 19 2019,positive,solid movie one of the better marvel soundtracks but should not been rated so high by rotten tomatoes
Mar 19 2019,positive,i honesty loved the movie thought it was one of marvels best movies ever madethe hate it is currently receiving is unbelievable and all false if your unsure about this movie i highly recommend the cast is great and brie is the perfect carol danversâïâïtm
Mar 19 2019,negative,i have nothing against bre larson but she just didnt seemed very happy to be in the movie captin marvel came off as dull with bad jokes and just very little to offer i found my self thinking wow i hope they make a nova movie i have no idea why but come on this had to be one of the biggest let downs in marvel i just dont even want to see her in endgame i know shes going to be in it but god just make her mute also for how many cgi people were working on this movie you expected better but hey they delivered the best captain marvel scenes so good job this is the solo of marvel the movie was dull and stiff with a plot that could put even the most enthusiastic asleep basically it even fails as a powerful leading women movie since samuel l jackson leads most of the movie with most of bres dialogue falling on deaf ears
Mar 19 2019,negative,really wanted to like this it is nothing to do with gender this movie just wasnt great characters were 1 dimensional the plot was just stupid and in general it was an origin story that contributes almost zero new or important info to the universe bummer 
Mar 19 2019,positive,its such a fun movie it is a fun watch with a great story about becoming your best self the soundtrack is great at times and a bit forced on others but altogether its fine brie larsen carries the character perfectly and it is awesome seeing her enjoy finding out her powers no need for political commentary around it its a great movie with a good lesson for any kid
Mar 19 2019,positive,i truly enjoyed the movie i think it held its own being the first female lead movie in the mcu brie did a great job bringing the character to life i even more so look forward to endgame now
Mar 19 2019,positive,it was a bit formulaic but not that doesnt make it a bad movie less heavy handed social agenda in comparison to black panther which is a plus but it is less compelling at the same time jude law is phoning it in as usual compared to micheal b jordan but the film is still top tier it is a solid film but dont expect it to be an endgame prequel bc that was never its intent
Mar 19 2019,positive,brie larson is fun and samuel l jackson a treat a thrilling new superhero joins the marvel universe and sheâtms very cool excited to see where captain marvel is headed
Mar 19 2019,negative,it was alright  good special effects  the biggest issue the movie has are the numerous plot holes and inconsistent emotional range from larson  use of the song just a girl by no doubt did not fit at all with the scene is was used in  you can safely skip this movie and watch endgame as it only serves to introduce carol danvers but doesnt provide any real information viewers need going into the avengers movie coming up
Mar 19 2019,positive,the movie was enjoyable but as i feared they made her too strong  really why do you need any of the other avengers  she can fly through space destroy battleships in seconds simply by flying through them and had she just killed ronan right there when she had the chance guardians of the galaxy sure would have been a lot different    seriously she could walk up and rip the gauntlet right off of thanos hand before he knew what was coming    like the rest of the franchise its well cast and visually appealing  there are humorous scenes and the cat is wonderful    they just made her too strong  we dont need any other avengers i think she can destroy planets    i guess well see why she needs anybody else in the upcoming avengers movie but i think she will just see them as fun toy friends
Mar 19 2019,positive,is it a perfect movie no it is not is it an enjoyable movie yes it is marvell does a fine job of introducing us to captain marvel it also gives a new take on the skrull wars been mendehlson practically steals the movie with his performance as the skrull general it also had a surprising to me at least tie in to the guardians of the galaxy
Mar 19 2019,negative,a bit slow at the beginning and rushed at the end felt weird
Mar 19 2019,negative,it was the most disappointing film from the mcu and whats worse is how rotten tomatoes keeps deleting my review why because i didnt like it lol thats so silly well im not gonna write out my whole review for the third time but i will say samuel jackson was the best part and brie larson was the opposite of it
Mar 19 2019,negative,nothing new to see plain boring except fury and the cat jokes are lame and she tries very hard but the character never grasps you like other superhero movies marvel
Mar 19 2019,negative,unoriginal lacks the marvel charm seems like she was trying to do a rip off of xena  warrior princess impression the cat was the only thing good about the film
Mar 19 2019,negative,i felt like i was waching michael bay without the dumb fun action that accompanys it no story and character development that made a kiddie pool blush
Mar 19 2019,positive,favourite marvel movie not sure why there was so much hate towards it
Mar 19 2019,positive,the plot development is a little slow but the film really picks up in the second half i really appreciated the stan lee tribute a must see for all marvel fans
Mar 19 2019,negative,brie is poorly casted in this one  her worst performance to date  too bad wanted this to be good
Mar 19 2019,negative,just bland no dimensions to the main character no real struggle or depth to the development and so few explanations its all just because
Mar 19 2019,positive,great movie im a trump supporter and i give this an 810 this film isnt sjw stuff honestly id give this 4 stars out of 5 but i wanna help fight the trolls 
Mar 19 2019,positive,awesome movie very empowering for women 
Mar 19 2019,negative,love all the marvel moviesexcept hulk and black panther add this to the listnot good at alland brie had no personalitymovie was all over the placesave your money
Mar 19 2019,positive,this was a fun stupid movie  while there is essentially a native ad for the air force in 34 of the movie its not jarring and its fine  its a fun shoot em up smash em up spectacle thats as deep as a wading pool but sometimes you want to eat candy instead of vegetables
Mar 19 2019,negative,not really worth the hype i have tried to like it but failed as the movie didnt live up to expectation
Mar 19 2019,neutral,it has some nice twists and ok jockes and action but overall it is a sunday afternoon movie    it is better than iron man 2 which makes it 2nd worst marvel movie    i believe they should replace brie larson hope she does better in endgame the movie feels like it was trying too hard     it is not bad but it isnt good it only served to setup a character i really do not care much for to appear in endgame
Mar 19 2019,negative,not a good movie the worst of the mcu in my opinion i gave it a chance and had a hard time watching the hole thing very dry and slow 
Mar 19 2019,positive,fantastic movie on many levels enjoyed the humour characters and visual effects
Mar 19 2019,negative,a tribute to brawn over brains    so finally saw the movie last night  had my hopes and expectations set to very low usually helps  however this movie was very bland    lets start with the things i did like    most of the side characters where actually decent some where already known others where new none of them explored very much but at least you got an impression about who they where    talos and fury both where decent and fury did a lot of wisecracking a good deal of which was quite fun talos in general i liked calm thoughtful and with more than 2 dimensions    now for the rest    the thing that pissed me off most of all is quite common in movies and its the inconsistencies  we see quite early that tho not at her full power yet she is clearly a lot stronger than the norm breaking a metal frame that she is locked in skrulls are weaker than her the big one apparently is stronger tho yet when we get to earth we see a skrull wrestle with fury for grip on a gun how did it not simply take it from him  we see 2 humans grab cm and hold her for a moment while she is attempting to attack a skrull with strengt like hers they would have no effect yet they hold her back i know this might seem like rambling but ffs make up your mind is she super strong or not  and same would go for the skrulls    then thereï 12 12tms the superman effect nothing quite makes for a boring superhero movie than one where our hero is not challenged basically cm is superman with the absence of kryptonite if the villain does not challenge the hero there is no struggle so what then are we watching  its much like the ending of jl superman arrives and its game over for the bad guy weee how fun    the main character does in no way pull me in i donï 12 12tmt care about her what she does and why a lot of it can be put on the superman effect i posted above but thatï 12 12tms not the only reason i donï 12 12tmt know weather or not its the script or bries acting but the character is so unlikeable from the stone faces grimace that does not look badass but just annoyingly sour to the lack of charm personality and humor everything about her just bored me  even when we where supposed to watch these buddy buddy scenes between mc and fury it just seemed so damned forced more than anything  i caught myself sitting and thinking i actually cared more for the bad guy henchman minnevrr or whatever her name was she had more personality than our main character a character with about 5 min screen time i had more insight into her at this point than i did to our main character her loyalties her disliking cm which seemed obvious from early on its pretty bad when 5 min screen time gives more about a character than a 2h movie does about the main character  the main character is also as my title says a tribute to brawn over brains she acts like an idiot quite a few times yet it donï 12 12tmt matter as she can just wave her hands around and it wont matter    story is somewhat acceptable not like we did not see who was the bad guy from the start of the movie but oh well what a twist big big surprise mistakes like the shield name did not help thereï 12 12tms also quite a lot of great and well known music from the 90ï 12 12tms yet it was just soï 12 12 poorly chosen    all in all i felt like i tried overly to not be annoyed at dumb things in the movie  i rated it 25
Mar 19 2019,positive,marvels one slip the timeline sheild did not have a name at this timelineper iron man  and fury id himself as a sheild agent otherwise this movie was awesome 
Mar 19 2019,negative,not even worth that expected way more from marvel
Mar 19 2019,negative,hated this movie awful acting absolutely noncompelling story line and very disorganized movie structure
Mar 19 2019,negative,its a generic marvel superhero backstory that could have been fitted in within the first 30 minutes of avengers end game the choices done by script writers directors and those who gathered the cast makes me root for thanos hopefully hell snap his fingers once more and take me and this godforsaken mistake out if marvel wants to redeem itself its best for them to get started on that black widow spinoff or a scarlet witch one either way i want to die and this movie just strengthened that need
Mar 19 2019,negative,captain marvel as a character is underdeveloped we never see her make mistakes learn and grow as a character every decision she made is always right and itâtms quite boring i was very disappointed in this movie because it was predictable
Mar 19 2019,positive,terrific movie and a solid addition to the mcu
Mar 19 2019,negative,i was underwhelmed by this film larsens acting was suppar and the story line was weak the villains in this movie were uninteresting and one dimensional the changing of marvell from a man to a woman was also kind of silly as well why would you make such a powerful hero out to be an old woman it seems marvel is trying to appease the feminists which will ruin the mcu the mcu has been able to steer clear from the politicizing of culture but i fear this is opening a sad chapter in the mcu going forward
Mar 19 2019,positive,solid but characters are lacking the emotional connection of say guardians of the galaxy full of chatty exposition which ties a lot of loose ends of the mcu together and sets up the impending defeat of thanos next month
Mar 19 2019,negative,almost worse than suicide squadalmost awful script horrific acting everyone got beaten by the acting abilities of a cat
Mar 19 2019,negative,maybe if this film had come out back in 2011 along side captain america i would have thought more of it but after seeing some fantastic mcu movies that keep upping the ante this film seemed to just not try very hard
Mar 19 2019,positive,movie was awesome i read all the bad reviews and was like oh no but im glad i didnt listen my son loved it trolls go kick rocks
Mar 19 2019,negative,i not joking i absolutely hated this film their is so much stuff that was just down right stupid the trailers where really underwhelming when they first came out and i wanted to go into the film with an opened mind but when the film ended the first words that came out of my mouth were  that was terrible brie larson gives such a wooden performance the way fury lost his eye was ridiculous i could rant more about the film but i choose not to the only part i liked was really the main skrull played by ben mendelsohn and not much else if others enjoyed it then thats fine but i just donï 12 12 12 12 12tmt understand why people think this film is amazing when it is clearly not
Mar 19 2019,negative,terrible script the worst acting iâtmve ever seen by the main character supporting actorsactresses was the only redeeming quality of this movie directorscreenwriter needs some serious coaching and larson needs to go to acting school
Mar 19 2019,positive,best marvel movie yet its exciting to finally see a female superhero have her own movie in the mcu the story was engaging brie fit the role of the stoic yet funny danvers and the fighting scenes were great im looking forward to watching captain marvel take on thanos in endgame
Mar 19 2019,positive,i went in with low expectations but was pleasently suprised this movie is far from the best movie in the mcu but finds itself right in the middle of the pack samuel l jackson as nick fury steals the show with his chrasmatic personality the 90s references are on point and abundant and i couldnt be happier about it the biggest problem i find with this movie is how it nakes rhe mcu timeline a bit sloppy and somewhat confusing
Mar 19 2019,neutral,this movie had some cool parts the best character hands down was nick fury the movie was entertaining for the most part but i really didnt care about the main character like i do for the other avengers not sure exactly how but it would have been nice to allow the character to develop more before they went full out op i say see it just so youll be ready for endgame
Mar 19 2019,negative,we saw captain marvel and we can away shaking our heads weve come to expect a lot more from marvel this movie was not what we had hoped for the next avengers movie better be up to par or else my family and i may be checking out of the marvel universe
Mar 19 2019,negative,boring movie really just because there is a female lead doesnt mean its good
Mar 19 2019,negative,really wish i had seen alita battle angel in 3d instead 
Mar 19 2019,positive,definitely good special effects were top notch and the plot was interesting gives a little depth to nick furyâtms character i enjoyed it
Mar 19 2019,positive,same recognisable marvel formula here elevated significantly by a talented lead
Mar 19 2019,positive,a great movie itâs not better than black panther but its good it is very important see this film before watch avengers end game
Mar 19 2019,negative,the movie wasnt super good to begin with but to insult the reviewers after made me not want to see it ever again
Mar 19 2019,positive,dont pay attention to all the dumb and angry people that never even seen the movie and gave a bad rating based on some comment brie larson said im here to rate the movie and as far as the marvel series go this was pretty good action story line and acting were entertaining i think they could have cast a better actress to play captain marvel bries character comes across a bit annoying and not very likable but besides her ok acting the movie is 4 out of 5 if you like the other marvel series you will enjoy this one too 
Mar 19 2019,negative,very average in comparison to some of the marvel movies thor 1 and 2 was on the same level
Mar 19 2019,positive,sticks to the marvel formula not adding a lot but i hope to see more colour added to the character of carol danvers later down the line i enjoyed the film a lot despite brie larsons mediocre performance unless she was delivering a humourous line
Mar 19 2019,positive,fantastic and fun thanos is toast
Mar 19 2019,positive,its up there with iron man better than ant man forsure
Mar 19 2019,positive,i loved it i officially bought nearly every comic book available with captain marvel in it and the flecker
Mar 19 2019,positive,i enjoyed it it was fun and to the mcu
Mar 19 2019,negative,captain marvel is a dull tasteless affair  the protagonist carol danvers portrayed by brie larson is besides from a few and short moments about as charismatic and charming as cersei lannister on a bad day she severely lacks emotional depth and growth throughout the movie   we follow her on her journey from overpowered to ridiculously overpowered with no real excitement or captive storytelling  the only scene with emotional depth is not even related to carol but the reunion of talos with his family ben mendelsohn does a fantastic job portraying the skrull leader    the movie seemed like a long series of anti climatic conclusions to the buildups and in my opinion ruined captain marvels chance to have created a hell yeah moment for the character  the cgi in the movie is for the most part throughout the movie quite good and up to mcu standards but falls behind in the end battle scene here the cgi looks like the quality you would expect from a tv show as the flash mediocre  besides the movies severe lack in quality storytelling and interesting character development it also manages to crap on the continuity and character quality of the franchise    luckily the movie doesnt offer much in terms of content in case you decide not to watch it before the release of endgame    all in all a mostly visually pleasing movie that is heavily carried by supporting actors but lacks in storytelling and depth  not worth either time or money
Mar 19 2019,negative,if at first you dont succeed not terrible but not very good too overpowered beats all opponents with ease and some of the cgi was pretty bad coulson looked like a waxwork dummy
Mar 19 2019,negative,very disappointing no acting at all
Mar 19 2019,positive,this movie exceeded my expectations its amazing for girls of all ages to see its such amazing representation of women in media instead of the usual sex icon for people to drool over shes respectful and such a huge inspiration i cant wait for endgame if i could rate 100 stars i would
Mar 19 2019,positive,loved it they did too much with the cgi on captain marvel to a point where it didnt look great
Mar 19 2019,negative,samuel l jackson good bad direction and script  characters is a shame
Mar 19 2019,positive,its better than aquaman but not as good as venom brie larson looked awkward and robotic in the role the writing is predictable and not particularly captivating i really like the female empowerment theme of the film but unfortunately the integration into a superhero movie seems forced
Mar 19 2019,negative,horrible waste of the mcu they should have let this character go every 2 years they need to put something out with the captain marvel name or they will legally not be able to use the characterso just give up on captain marvel one of the worst superhero movies ever if not the worst the plot is bad the humor is corny and the messages the film has is appalling movies are media remember that
Mar 19 2019,negative,very average nothing like thor not interesting
Mar 19 2019,negative,the acting is ok but sometimes the acting seems pale and brie larson doesnt portray emotion in the role as capt marvel very good this of course could just be due to bad instruction from the director the action scenes are fine but the story is very thin    of all the movies from mcu this is probably the worst besides avengers 2 captain marvel feels rushed full of plot holes and and when leaving the cinema you dont feel any different than you did before watching the movie    an ok movie if you like action but just ok nothing fantastic
Mar 19 2019,positive,i loved this movie and iâtmm so happy about captain marvel being added to the avengers universe i never really go to the movie theater except to see marvel and lego movies and this one did not disappoint itâtms so relatable empowering and surprisingly funny i hope i get to see more of the guy who was afraid of goose withholding name because spoiler at some point
Mar 19 2019,positive,definitely aimed at a female audience which is fine
Mar 19 2019,negative,captain marvel lacks character development and her character arc feels more like a character line in an effort to show that women are not emotional they strip her of her humanity what these movies must learn is itâtms okay to have emotions and still be a strong woman and the ability to feel can be our strength it feels as though they agree with the people saying emotional women are weak for a female character they attempt to reverse all the stereotypes and never grant her the ability to be weak which they give to the male heroes
Mar 19 2019,negative,acting is mediocre and forgettable how nick fury lose his eye okay and how avengers got there name okay this is a forgettable marvel film
Mar 19 2019,negative,went in wanting to like it but the acting was bad and story was boring the action was ok but could not save this film
Mar 19 2019,negative,worst acting and plot of any mcu movie  this should never have been made  i wish i didnt get the ticket presale
Mar 19 2019,negative,absolute yawn fest ledt after 50 minutes dont waste your time    i say this as a marvel fan as well  which makes it even worse    terrible cgi terrible acting inappropriately placed music jokes that fall flat honestly the worst marvel film in a long time
Mar 19 2019,negative,insulting and basic captain marvel is a strong female character not a strong character who is female thats an important difference carole is bland and unfunny and has no character by far the worst marvel movie ive ever seen the only saving grace is the beautiful effects but that is expected from marvel
Mar 19 2019,negative,horribly disappointed i was really looking forward to this movie but i thought the plot was very weak and felt at moments they just played music instead of having some good dialogue was expecting a much more entertaining film i definitely will pass over this when it shows up on tv
Mar 19 2019,positive,my kids and i enjoyed the movie  being in my 50âtms i got more of the cultural references than my two boys did early teens especially the mall rats script stan lee was reading on the bus  i unfortunately tend to rate these movies by my sonâtms bathroom breaks  the more times they get up the less interested they are in the movie  they sat in their seats for most this film  it was worth a trip to the theater to see it in imax
Mar 19 2019,positive,i hated the trailers and i thought this movie was gonna be boring to the fullest but in the end i kinda liked it but even though it has some funny and charming moments it has some so cringe moments that make you want to leave your seat they tried so cringy to give the protagonist funny things to say and do to a character that clearly isnâtmt a comedian like spiderman or antman i came out from theater seeing captain marvel like a strong and creative heartwarming superhero i loved her serious moments they made her mature and smart last the story was easy and fun to follow the background was so beautiful and the action was cool conclusion worth seeing it but beware the cringeness
Mar 19 2019,negative,i dont want to sound like a troll its just not good
Mar 19 2019,negative,not that good if it wasnt for the skrull actor or the cat this would have sucked
Mar 19 2019,negative,i thought i was going to like this film 1 hour in and i was except i turned to my 7 year old he was terrified despite having watched all the other mcu films this is the only one he couldnt watch so for the toy buying portion of the audience the film didnt work     i then watched the rest of the film on my own the middle bit was dull the final scenes were rubbish the film and me parted ways finally when captain marvel could suddenly destroy nuclear bombs with her hands and could navigate through space using only her brain scooby doo ending not for me
Mar 19 2019,negative,this movie had a lot of promise and i was very optimistic going in  it has a lot of neat ideas but doesnt really pay them off  the biggest twists were both spoiled by the movie itself    it could have done a neat bourne identity type story discovering her past but the trailers already told us who she was and in case you missed the trailers the movie shows us in a mindreading flashback  they could have done a nice twist about who are the good guys and who are the bad guys but the movie spoils that by showing us characters who were revealed as villains in guardians of the galaxy  it could have done a nice fish out of water story but brie larsons performance is completely onenote there is no real change in behavior between âversâ and carol      and on a side note the deaging on fury was good but carrying on that technology for that much screen time makes the uncanny valley affect inevitable and it did take me out of the story a few times  and coulson looked downright plastic in the stairwell scene      i really wanted to like this  but i didnt
Mar 19 2019,neutral,acting  poor  except for nick fury which i really actually feel connected to now which is great  everyone else  i felt like the bad guys had more expression    story  make evil bad guys victims  make normal things or obstacles extreme  warning    there are no heros in the telling of this story  super hero movie but no heroes      setscgiaudiocostumeextras  top notch   everything felt very natural in the enviroment  sounds costumes hair styles  no over yhr top exaggeration  everything felt amazing with sets nd cgi was great  great work crew teams and leads  best part of this film      pop culture has always been a reflection of a topic that can be hard to address  whether drugs family racism poverty mental illness and even disconnect  we look at heroes to be an example so we can strive to be like them  this movie gave me no reason to want to be captain marvel  i do not respect her and i do not look up to her  she is not a leader or even a person to do the right thing  she does what she wants and feels  steal  lie  manipulate cheat insecure  why do i need powers to be above all that is bad  no  you are a hero bc you can have these qualities without powers  this movie teaches us  unless you are rich and powerful you are never going to be strong enough    example  captain america standing against thanos  no way  completely one sided but he fights for what is right and to protect no matter the foe or how strong they are  hes been through extreme hardship pain sadness and conflict  he grew and no matter what held true to be a good person      captain marvel  only when its a benefit
Mar 19 2019,positive,it was enjoyable and feel good but i think they tried to do too much which threw the pacing off brie larson and samuel l jacksons chemistry is fun not the best marvel movie but it definitely does its job as an origin story 
Mar 19 2019,negative,horrible wooden acting plot holes childish script absolute trash 
Mar 19 2019,positive,im not sure why it received so much bad publicity this was a excellent movie in my opinion
Mar 19 2019,neutral,the movie had its fun moment specially with samuel jackson and ben mendelsohn as my favorites of the movie but i was bored mostly throughout the film overall it was an okay movie and my least favorite marvel movie
Mar 19 2019,negative,terrible plot line the flashbacks werenâtmt done and it just felt like a movie to avoid zeus ex machine in avengers endgame brie larson was supposed to be funny despite the fact that she delivered her lines without any emotion overall the relationships between the characters felt rushed and unbelievable i honestly wouldnâtmt have cared if one of them died the cgi seemed worse than all movies before it overall i would never see this movie again and was only glad i wasted my money to understand the upcoming avengers movie a little better
Mar 19 2019,positive,im thrilled with a female superhero my daughter can take to im also thrilled with the relative standalone feel to this mcu entry vs so many others especially since my daughter has not seen most of the other movies all that being said this movie was simply not to mcus standards it lacked the emotional connection with the protagonist that the other movies do so well im also not sure brie larson was the best actress for this role seemed emotionally detached too often i simply didnt care enough about her character early enough in the movie to feel much about her when i think the film needed me to later in the movie the dialogue was also pretty onedimensional in parts    then sam jackson killed it as always loved ben mendelsohn and jude law huge fan of gemma chan from humans     all in all this was entertaining and while not up to mcu standards still more repeatedly watchable than say thor dark world
Mar 19 2019,positive,lesbian vibe is strong but i liked it a lot great date movie
Mar 19 2019,neutral,boring and predictable im not a superhero fan to be fair i only really like the xmen and gotg i will soon forget this film and the kids were fidgety during it it wasted some time on a wet weekendim not looking forward to endgame either bring on the next xmen
Mar 19 2019,positive,so much fun great ride i enjoyed all of it music action comedy all of it was epic
Mar 19 2019,positive,ultimately underwhelming
Mar 19 2019,positive,i enjoyed the movie it is full of action
Mar 19 2019,neutral,poor to mid grade marvel movie that failed to connect me to the character at all
Mar 19 2019,positive,really good movie both as a standalone film and as a set up for the next avengers
Mar 19 2019,negative,i wish i liked it more  didnt really emotionally connect to anything in the movie  the relationship with her best friend seemed kind of    empty  not much character development for captain marvel  she basically just remembers stuff about herself over a period of time with kind of a bland acceptance  on a positive note there are some cool easter eggs that relate to the broader universe
Mar 19 2019,positive,at the beginning of the movie is a bit confusing and even boring but before the events begins to get interesting the skrulls are the enemies of carol and her companions in the face of events in the land carol loses her memory after a plane crash and so that she ended up in hala supposed to home her after being captured on a planet by the skrulls she ends up stopping on planet earth and finally she discovers who she really is
Mar 19 2019,negative,i would rather not relive this by detailing what was bad 
Mar 19 2019,neutral,captain marvel looks great and has an great supporting cast what isnt so great is the stilted acting from captain marvel herself this is further compounded by the fact that the 2 emotions displayed by captain marvel stern and unimpressed are prevalent through out her character arc showing little else     what further worsens this is how captain marvels character arc is losing memory and regaining memory only learning how awesome she is when the switch flips and memory is regained    theres no tony learning to be a compassionate hero or steve learning to think for himself outside of what the government orders its a switch that turns someone from confident to arragent     its great too to see a super hero movie thats meant for girls its about time that they have a movie where they can relate to the main character unfortunately their movie stars someone so perfect that the only thing they learn is that they are more perfect than perfect    my onlyhope is that this doesnt bleed into end game and that captain marvel shows growth as a character outside of im awesome and have always been awesome
Mar 19 2019,negative,not so good as the film grossed
Mar 19 2019,negative,i do not understand the people that enjoyed this movie  its a made for tv production  horrible story bad acting by marvel  ignored the comic narratives   
Mar 19 2019,positive,itâtms an ok marvel movie itâtms one note which does make it easy to start checking your phone halfway through samuel l jackson as a younger nick fury is the best part of the movie action is pretty boring and became just a formula  for these marvel movies nothing ground breaking here
Mar 19 2019,positive,no it isnt the strict marvel 616 universe but it was a really good retelling of the kreeskrull war i want a flerken
Mar 19 2019,negative,i dont have any hate for the movie but the story was flat    there is so much more to captain marvel that they could have done only good thing was seeing sam jackson and the guy that plays coulson that guy is an awesome actor  oh and the guy that jude law playing the bad guy did a good job too  but yeah the plot sucked and thats what ruined it for me  also the whole montage of people telling her she couldnt do something no one talks like thatwas very very dumb  i would of loved to see this movie put more effort into the story of the character than try to piecemeal so many different things that it lost itself
Mar 19 2019,negative,total uninspired posturing and predictable linesthe movie simply didnt care about itself and the acting save for a few bright spots by law and mendelsohn was flat not worth watching
Mar 19 2019,positive,im a father and saw this movie with my daughters i do not watch any of the the super hero movies there is just something fishy about spandix clad people saving the world    i find it so humorous that so many of the typical super hero movie lovers hate this movie  i think it has more to do with the hero being a woman than the actual movie  get over it guys captain marvel is way more powerfull than the boy heroes and she is going to save the day in the next movie  no need to intentionally vote down this movie  just remember despite you boycotting it plenty of other people will go see it and it will be popular despite all your spam review efforts
Mar 19 2019,positive,not the best or the worst entry in the mcu which following wonder woman feels like a miss by marvel 
Mar 19 2019,negative,i honestly was bored during the movie the story was way to boring and also not linear and confusing at some times i felt like watching thor 2 again where i did not care about the story either i did like many of the side characters such as fury but captain marvel wasnt really easy to like and feel sympathy for because she seemed like someone without any personality
Mar 19 2019,neutral,pretty boring i almost fell asleep  brie larsons acting was not great and seemed robotic also her one liners were terrible  i think out of all of the marvel movies i laughed the least in this overall very bland i would almost recommend skipping it before endgame
Mar 19 2019,positive,really good representation of the character from the comics while still taking a different approach to captain marvels origin this movie manages to be a really entertaining movie while also being a super hero origin movie
Mar 19 2019,negative,poorest marvel movie nothing else to say
Mar 19 2019,negative,weak script weak acting good efects
Mar 19 2019,positive,a great addition to the marvel universe but the movie follows the typical marvel movie format
Mar 19 2019,negative,not the best of marvel a movie that was selled by the marketing as a epic women centered movie if you are open minded in the super heroes moviesgo and watch wonder woman
Mar 19 2019,positive,i thought it was a pretty good movie 7 out of 10  below are some highlights potential spoilers     i believe nick fury has more screen time in this movie than all previous movies combined and i found it very interesting to learn more about his backstory  and how he lost his eye     i found it poignant and almost sad seeing agent coulson again i found myself looking at the young agent who was had no idea yet on what a large part hed have to play in the future of shield the avengers and the future of the world i wanted to warn him about loki but alas i was helpless     the history of earths tesseract is further explained which i found kind of interesting     i found it super interesting to learn that initially nick furys pet project was going to be named the protector initiative but at the last moment renamed it the avenger initiative  although captain america is often named as the first avenger i found it super cool to learn that the entire initiative was inspired by captain marvels air force call sign  she literally is avenger     we learn where nick fury got his pager and who he paged at the end of infinity war stick around for the credits    things that werent so great     it started off a little slow     its not super clear to me why the infinity war emergency warranted nick fury paging captain marvel but not any of the previous earthshattering disasters     captain marvel is a way overpowered i win button  if you compare her powers to hawkeye or even spiderman theyre not even in the same league    again overall i liked the flick and would watch it again
Mar 19 2019,positive,i personally liked the movie very much though sometimes i felt it was a little preditcable a few times i also thought the cgi couldve been a little better but i care about the movie not about the actress so with that 4 stars earned
Mar 19 2019,negative,i found the character bland and disappointing back story is pretty much green lantern to many plot holes the tesser is a powerful weapon that red skull couldnt hold but a cat can hold onto it  i hope she is better in endgame
Mar 19 2019,negative,honestly i thought it would be better  i would much rather have had a movie on black widow or scarlet witch
Mar 19 2019,positive,by far best stand alone marvel movie 
Mar 19 2019,positive,not the best marvel movie the acting was ok many boring scenes could have been alot better
Mar 19 2019,positive,excellent movie a little too formulaic and predicable to earn top marks but overall very fun and enjoyable
Mar 19 2019,positive,captain marvel was your basic superhero movie filled with fast action and well performed stunts however setting this movie apart from all the others is the quick wit humor and amazing cast brie larson gives an empowering performance playing captain marvel in this 90s nostalgia filled adventure captain marvel finds herself caught in the middle of an intergalactic battle between her people the kree and the shapeshifting skrulls who are trying to invade earth with help from nick fury played by pulp fiction era samuel l jackson thanks to special effects she tries to save the earth while uncovering secrets of her past that come back to her in dreams as recurring memories of another life as a us air force pilot carol danvers the movie while important for female empowerment being the first main female hero movie in the mcu is also a great metaphor and comment on our war torn world right now and refugees who are forced to find a new home while being viewed as the enemy also setting this movie apart is the lack of romance instead choosing to focus on characterization and growth as well as familial and platonic relationships  also reggie the cat as goose was amazing he showed pure talent and put on a showstopping performance he is the best actor of this generation 1010 star performance give reggie his academy award now
Mar 19 2019,neutral,an entertaining move on its own where it fall flat is how it link in to the mcu how furry lost his eye was just dumb the move strains itself to connect it to the mcu with disappointing use and often slight recon of established lore brie larson gives a good performance what stops it from being great is the lack of impact on dramatic lines think this fi
Mar 19 2019,positive,captain marvel is a missed opportunity for a great film i enjoyed it it was fun but it was just ok my main critique is that we don not see a dynamic character development in carol danvers like we find in for example tony stark the danvers that we are introduced to at the beginning of the film is more or less the same as the danvers we see at the end just with more power and a more accurate view of reality the stakes are never really that high and danvers never faces any real challenge realizing that she had a life on earth meeting up with her old friend maria rambeau discovering that she had been manipulated and lied to about the kree etc all had the potential to explore some depth and heart but didnâtmt danvers seems to just go along with each new discovery and push forward with brute strength i donâtmt thin the film missed it by much and a few small tweaks here an there would have made a huge difference
Mar 19 2019,negative,not really able to empathize with the story the cinematography was amazing but the story left much to be desired
Mar 19 2019,negative,not much thought went into making this moviethe objective seemed to be slapping something togerher to have a new character added to the avengers could not find any human values to relate to in this new character she is cold and acts like an undestructable robot that has all kinds of powers and no weakness lifeless like arnold in terminator at least arnold has humor and can get damaged all other marvel characters have some human values that audience can related to not this one having said all this i love marvel movies and found this movie somewhat entertaining but least favorite among all
Mar 19 2019,negative,too many plot holes lazy writing but great graphics shouldve and couldve been better not up to mcu standards
Mar 19 2019,positive,the film was better than i expected i enjoyed most things about this film i could have done without some of the cheesy one liners but other than that it was something i would 100 recommend for the mcu fans and also to just someone who enjoys a good modern action film
Mar 19 2019,positive,solid entry to the mcu appropriately action packed and humourous enjoyable from start to finish visually a strong look i enjoyed watching the character embrace her powers and learn to use them
Mar 19 2019,negative,quite a linear progression with dull action scenes also if youre a fan of marvel there are a few timelines contradictions not as good as you would expect from marvel
Mar 19 2019,negative,as a very marvel movies fan i have to accept that this one can be the worst mcu movie so far the plot is very poor the humor is ridiculous some things are just stupid i just hope that this terrible story doesnt affect end game
Mar 19 2019,neutral,a very servicable movie it had its moments at times at others it seemed forced jackson was superb as per usual larson didnt know if she was going to play it straight or as an action comedy as many of her punchlines fell flat the action was on point
Mar 19 2019,positive,movie was amazing i dont need to prove anything to you
Mar 19 2019,negative,film failed on so many levels by writing a very weak lead character not only that on a pr and marketing level around the film probably the worst addition to the comic book universe in recent times
Mar 19 2019,positive,what captain marvel essentially builds upon is the old good dialectic of the town and the country a nucleus thriving upon resources drawn from the surroundings like a cancer cell gone rogue no empire can exist without dispossession nor can the kree but as with every empire there are people who cant fully get onboard with the industrial slaughter and the pragmatists the justifiers have one tool ready at their disposal ideology ideology a narrative a reductionism a binary a simplification    between good and evil    by painting the skrull wars as wars against evil monsters the empire mystifies the actual contradiction shrouded in public ignorance it resolves into a false binary very very much same as the argument the us empire builds as the war to bring freedom to periphery countries    but the empire forgets it cannot suppress or hide contradictions theyll squeeze out and rearrange contradictions are in essence the only real shapeshifters    thus the contradiction finds its strongest expression in carol turned vres turned carol who had it all lost it all having it all again robbed of her past identity assigned great power while having nothing to hold on to building a new identity for herself it is carol who embodies the dialectic at its purest and in conclusion the liberators of the dispossessed are dispossessed themselves in some way
Mar 19 2019,negative,went last sunday to give the movie a chance and this was the first movie i fell asleep in i really thought this was the worst of the mcu movies boring i liked maria rambo character who was the friend of carol the action was dull for a marvel movie this was nothing but filler 
Mar 19 2019,positive,captain marvel is a great character the movie is well written and brings a lot of the backstory to the avengers series for those who have watched from the beginning this movie fits nicely and serves as a bit of a prequel youâtmll learn how fuhry got started how the tesseract got to earth etc i only wish captain marvel had been introduced in earlier avengers movies sheâtms extremely exciting to watch once the real fighting begins  byebye thanos
Mar 19 2019,positive,this was a great original origin story i like how the flashbacks were holographic in depiction excited for more of captain marvel in the mcu
Mar 19 2019,positive,fun midtier marvel entry it could have benefited from cutting about 30 min but otherwise is enjoyable the nice chemistry between bree larson and samuel l jackson is a highlight surprisingly political undertones dealing with immigration and refugees for a marvel movie worth catching
Mar 19 2019,positive,against some of the other reviews on this site i really enjoyed this movie 100 the acting was on point brie is an amazing captain marvel and samuel l jackson is great as ever also the cat come on 55
Mar 19 2019,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed captain marvel superb casting and great storyline   i dont understand the carry on about it being really feminist i dont think its any different from all the other mcu movies there are plenty of seriously strong and bad ass women in the mcu  the movie ticks all the marvel boxes and looking forward to captain marvel team up with the avengers in endgame
Mar 19 2019,negative,this is the third time ive written this review so ill keep it short this movie completely misses a chance at developing the character of captain marvel  fight scenes are boring visuals are not unique and im not sure why a viewer would be rooting for the heroine because she doesnt have to overcome anything  i wanted more and i hold marvel studios to a higher standard  this was meh
Mar 19 2019,negative,really bad and bland acting from brie jackson and the other actors did a really good job tough but imo they shoulda went with someone else for captain marvel   did not enjoy the movie as much as i wanted
Mar 19 2019,positive,amazing movie  dont listen to the trolls 
Mar 19 2019,positive,it was an awesome movie showing how captain marvel became a superhero i cant wait to see her in the avengers
Mar 19 2019,positive,fantastic movie  simple as that  a perfect fit for the mcu
Mar 19 2019,positive,my daughter and i adore this movie  it starts with a coldopen fight scene that initially confused my kids but as the story picks up the momentum quickly becomes engrossing  i love this empowerment origin story of a lady overcoming the unfortunately alltootypical barriers of male chauvanism abuse and discrimination coming in to her own power the simpleenough plot twists engaged my son the movie puns and all those 90s references definitely kept my attention im glad the air force got a big patriotic boost of advertising in this one as always stay through the credits  we all had a great time well be buying this film
Mar 19 2019,negative,contrived it has the glimmer of a marvel movie but none of the cleverness feels like a hamfisted attempt the themes in the movie are so heavy handed that they over take the plot that really does a terrible job of piecing the marvel timeline together it actually creates more problems than it solves the more i think about the movie the less i like it if you liked iron man 3 then youre going to love captain marvel 
Mar 19 2019,positive,ive seen it twice and it kept my attention both times bries charm and charisma make captain marvel very relatable and like able mcus future is bright with captain marvel at the forefront 
Mar 19 2019,positive,great fun a solid movie and did not as formulaic as all the other marvel films which has gotten so boring couldve used a bit more lightheartedness but overall a very solid addition to the marvel universe and to all those delicate boys out there who desperately downvoted it because of how insecure it made them feel i hope you can find a way to grow up and not feel so vulnerable it must be a really tough way to go through life but hopefully after youre through puberty that will fade away for you until then thoughts and prayers
Mar 19 2019,negative,very poor not a patch on wonder woman
Mar 19 2019,positive,great movie love the character and brie larson is fantastic
Mar 19 2019,positive,some nice parts and unexpected twists not enough soul though and deeper meanings for the spectators the wedge boots are definitely missing compared to wonder women black widow and gamora
Mar 19 2019,positive,super fun and exciting  another great mavel origin story funny good music  i saw some posts from trolls ahead of time that completely lied about things the actress supposedly said  they must be getting their misinformation from the same places  superheroes have to overcome challenges and i dont see carol danvers having to deal with sexism as any different than peter parker or steve rogers having to deal with bullying  the film doesnt hit you over the head with it its a very small part of the film  if that triggers you then dont see the movie  if not then i think youll really enjoy the film
Mar 19 2019,positive,i thought this was a great movie and would highly recommend it to others brie larson does a great job as captain marvel and samuel l jackson is great
Mar 19 2019,positive,loved it action packed 
Mar 19 2019,positive,seen it a week ago i was well entertained by the movie but isnt that the whole point of a fictional story btw 50 plus white male here
Mar 19 2019,negative,its obvious that the backlash this movie is receiving is for good reason shame on marvel
Mar 19 2019,positive,the movie was very good i really enjoyed it im surprised the rating is so low of course its not infinity war but it was a very good movie in its own right she did a great job as captain marvel and i like the way it leads into the final avengers movie
Mar 19 2019,positive,a little slow to start but once it gets going this movie is so much fun captain marvel is charming and powerful she will make a great addition to the expanded universe and i am very excited to see her return in end game nick fury was also incredible in this film as it gives us his whole motivation as a character its awesome to see a hero experiencing what many women experience in their lives but still coming out on top it makes her really relatable which can be difficult to do for someone as powerful as captain marvel the plot was also quite clever and i left the cinema smiling only real criticism is that for me it was a bit slow to start and i think it was a little long but the climax is so worth it
Mar 19 2019,negative,was kinda good but seemed like another unoriginal origin story the cgi in the end of the movie was looked like it was completely animated 
Mar 19 2019,positive,bit corny but otherwise very fun film
Mar 19 2019,neutral,meh was ok but overall it was missing something i am not sure what but i just did not feel engaged by brie larsons performance it wasnt at a green lantern level of suckiness but it certainly did not blow my socks off like i hoped it would
Mar 19 2019,positive,blistering fun nostalgic and brie larson is a phenomenal lead one of the strongest solo outings in the mcu
Mar 19 2019,negative,terrible the worst marvel movie to date and its not because brie larson is a woman its because she runs like the daughter in taken her witty sarcastic remarks make her a bit more likeable but not more believable i dont feel any more excited about endgame than i did walking in all i feel is that weird misappropriated guilt about being male horrible barely coherent plot overpowered main character save yourself 1350 
Mar 19 2019,positive,what a great movie
Mar 19 2019,positive,very enjoyable well casted ties in nicely with the other movies i want to see it again
Mar 19 2019,negative,disappointing  iâtmm glad i watched it but i doubt iâtmll do so a second time  what couldshould have been a great film to lead into endgame feels like a lazily written project just farted out with a sense of entitlement to praise because itâtms another marvel movie  the first 20 minutes are an exposition dump taking what should have been a rigorously explored set of plot points and simply rattling them off to the audience  the same thing could have been accomplished in 2 minutes of narration with the same effect  the fight choreography which should have been one of the strongest points of the film was entirely underwhelming  elements of conspiracy and mystery were interesting in the story but ultimately were introduced at the exspense of themes the movie clearly wanted to introduce but barely touched on  danvers is supposed to have struggled her whole life to prove herself being a woman in a maledominated field  we get brief flashes that ultimately amount to nothing  if they were taken out of the movie the plot would be entirely unchanged  ideas are introduced barely touched and then dropped  the climax of the movie is dull too fast and again quite underwhelming  what could have been a great origin story for fury and the establishment of shield was lazily slapped together and frankly just seems to retroactively hurt the mcu  hereâtms hoping they do a much better job with this character in endgame because this was a lackluster introduction
Mar 19 2019,positive,captain marvel presents a departure from the usual origin story and classical heros journey deploying a nonlinear story chock full of engaging and wellrounded characters captain marvel is one of the mcus best
Mar 19 2019,positive,very funny nive action scene nice to get a lady super hero that is not over sexualized perfect addition to the mcu
Mar 19 2019,neutral,the quality of a power ranger movie
Mar 19 2019,negative,guess they could make a more boring hero than captain america im sorry captain you was not so bad
Mar 19 2019,positive,this was everything i wanted such a great movie 
Mar 19 2019,negative,dull boring and overall way below what youd expect from a marvel movie kinda sad to be honest
Mar 18 2019,negative,probably the worst marvel movie to date most marvel movies are cheesy but this one is particularly bad i like watching the avenger movies non of them make me whence the way this one did i think it was the directing or maybe the editing it felt very ameture and the 90âtms refrefrences felt very very forced kurt cobain might have rolled in grave and the no doubt song went on and on in a way that didnâtmt complement the scene it exploited 90s mainstream culture but they failed to pull any nastalgic emotion it does not compare to wonder woman not even close sorry i was rooting for it but it just bombed plain and simple
Mar 18 2019,positive,just got around to seeing the movie tonight i was one of those who stayed away from the opening because of all of the drama what a regret i thought it was a great popcorn movie i really enjoyed it for what it was entertainment
Mar 18 2019,negative,slow and painful to watch  trying too hard to make it funny but failed my friend fall sleep 10 min in the movie why too many plot holes
Mar 18 2019,positive,a movie by geeks about geeks for geeks marvel has tapped into almost every film genre even now unto itself iron man 3 was their christmas movie winter soldier was a political thriller and captain marvel is marvels marvel movie ten stars
Mar 18 2019,neutral,it was my least favorite marvel movie to date
Mar 18 2019,negative,very dull for a mcu movie
Mar 18 2019,positive,a little weak about the storyline 
Mar 18 2019,positive,it was cool funny sad a couple of god twists and kick ass when it had to be just like all the other marvel films trolls get over it
Mar 18 2019,negative,not that entertaining
Mar 18 2019,positive,so great to see a fun movie with meaning i know some folks arent used to constantly hearingseeing messages of empowerment for everyone instead of their own group but this movie hits on all marks
Mar 18 2019,negative,it picked up towards the end but over all its a dull story the movie seems to hinge on the likability of the characters rather than providing an exciting story or cinematography it falls short in achieving this as the main character is blah not sure if its just the acting or the character is written this way like superman minus any of his endearing qualities i would have given it a basic watchable but non memorable 25 stars if it werent for the ridiculous loopholes in addition to extremely unnecessary alterations to the mythos one in particular that take away from the story rather than add to it if you are a general movie watcher 25 stars but for marvel fans 1 star
Mar 18 2019,negative,one of the better marvel installments
Mar 18 2019,positive,loved it it had all the elements one would expect from a marvel film and it is done very well i hate the bullying gangmentality campaign that tried to decide the fate of this movie rather than allow viewers the opportunity to assess the movie without bias it just made me want to see it more glad i did thanks to rotten tomatoes for not letting the trolls windef the right move to combat the jerks with too much time on their hands and delicate sensitivities larson and the rest of the cast are outstanding
Mar 18 2019,negative,marvels first true and true failure i donâtmt care at all about what brie larson said i actually agree but a bad movie is a bad movie lot of forced jokes that did not land nearly absurd levels of exposition by itself it is at best a meh movie but in connection to the mcu itâtms a deep betrayal to the quality i have become accustomed too
Mar 18 2019,negative,too far away from the graphic novel hero we know flat perfomance from larson and alot of propaganda saying how brave she is how giving she is how powerful she is its shoved down your throat rather than shown you and taken you on a story to experience it with her not any rememberable fight scenes very bland hero arc very weak villain and an odd pacing and climax lead to a super predicable story 
Mar 18 2019,negative,what the hell is that crap  went to see it with a friend we fell asleep about 4 times during the movie it was so damn bad that we didnt even stay for the credits scenes  what a waste of time and money
Mar 18 2019,positive,slow boring the title character doesnt really change and doesnt gain or lose a whole lot by the films end seems like a sidekick in her own movie 
Mar 18 2019,neutral,i wanted very much to like this movie but it truly was just mediocre there were some cool moments but overall i left feeling shorted carol danvers is an amazing character with tons of potential and i cant help but feel they forced things and made her uninteresting the acting wasnt that great but i have a feeling it was the cheesy writing more than the actors overall this wasnt a bad movie it just wasnt very good
Mar 18 2019,negative,worst of marvel movie
Mar 18 2019,positive,iâtmm not sure why anyone would give this movie s bad review this is a good fun origin story brie larsen is a good cast for this role she is very likeable and lends some quirkiness to the character this is well written and very entertaining as  much as any other marvel movie i would definitely recommend seeing it
Mar 18 2019,negative,boring and predictable film captain marvel is an unnecessary addition to the marvel universe i hate films where characters are trying to remember who they are id rather start the film understanding the characters development right from the beginning  
Mar 18 2019,negative,storyline is boring and the hero is completely invulnerable shes completely invincible and it does not make for an intriguing hero
Mar 18 2019,negative,honestly this movie seems to be way overrated worth watching but not worth seeing in theaters wish i could get my money back this should have gone direct to vhs wait till itâtms on netflix or watch it bootleg or something if you really wanna see it that bad
Mar 18 2019,positive,loved it maybe one of my favorite marvel movies
Mar 18 2019,positive,35 stars  it has slow points and takes as long to get off the ground as capt marvels powers but once it does it stands with any other stand alone origin story and is as solid addition to the mcu as dr strange or ant man especially good was the chemistry between larson and jackson and it was good seeing agent coulson back in action 
Mar 18 2019,positive,absolutely loved this movie
Mar 18 2019,negative,was not impressed    yeah i know the mcu is not the marvel comic universe i grew up with 1960s through 80s  but seriously they could have done so much better and so much more with this character     spoiler   kinda sad when the most memorable scene is someone hold a cat and asking it to attack aliens 
Mar 18 2019,positive,everyone got to shine except the titular character in the movie was also very confusing a some points
Mar 18 2019,negative,it was kind of slow it was good to see the back story before the next avengers movie but it was just an ok movie on its own
Mar 18 2019,positive,solid film only downside was the slow beginning other than that it was funny had lots of great action and carol was an awesome protagonist
Mar 18 2019,negative,best part of this movie was the cat samuel jackson was a close second good to have the backstory before bringing captain marvel in to save the day for the avengers but brie larson was an extremely poor choice for this role very flat in her expressions and i couldnâtmt buy into her as a woman with a forgotten past that she finally learns about or as an action hero action scenes especially toward the end are the typically long drawnout for the sake of adding time scenes and donâtmt really make sense when you see the level of her power iâtmm sure captain marvel will fit right into endgame as a character without wasting time or money seeing this movie since the main tieins are the post credit scenes
Mar 18 2019,positive,really enjoyed this  brie is charming in her very own way it wasnt my favorite marvel film but i liked it and would watch it again sometime
Mar 18 2019,negative,movie was mediocre at best had so much to work with but just seemed to fall flat
Mar 18 2019,neutral,nothing to say but another marvel movie     samuel jackson and clark gregg by far the best parts of this movie along with all the marvel universe references
Mar 18 2019,positive,great movie with an interesting plot twist
Mar 18 2019,positive,absolutely brilliant best marvel movie to date ignore the trolls and completely worth seeing in imax 3d
Mar 18 2019,positive,this movie balances a superhero action movie and a selflearning lesson perfectly by having the perfect amount of action packed scenes and emotional captivating scenes
Mar 18 2019,neutral,the movie suffered from weak writing and brie larsons poor acting i dont know how she was ever cast for this role unless her competition for the part was danny devito in a wig i found her wooden and lacking any character dynamics she was a cookie cutter comic hero with no real depth her backstory was muddled and incoherent here character arc was rudderless  i sometimes found myself forgetting where she was going or what the mission was there were plenty of entertaining action scenes but not enough to carry the movie one thing that did come out of this movie is a very obvious need to make a buddy cop film staring young coulson and nick fury youre welcome marvel make this film
Mar 18 2019,neutral,great popcorn flick if you want to watch something and turn your mind off  but emotionally falls far short of any typical marvel movie
Mar 18 2019,positive,lacked individualism  felt bland comapred to other marvel films  still the effects were spot on
Mar 18 2019,negative,poor script and worse integration into the marvel cinematic universe the amnesia storyline got in the way of carol as a character leaving her as a 1 dimensional character whose character traits are snarky with regards to integration into the marvel universe it made previously understandable plot points less clear and made the character of nick fire feel worse in previous marvel movies with the winter soldier taking the hardest hit
Mar 18 2019,positive,i was actually pretty surprised at how good the movie was considering the scores its been getting ignore the snowflake reviewers on here that are clearly overly sensitive and offended by some words an actress said enjoy the movie for what it is a strong addition to the mcu universe 
Mar 18 2019,positive,i really enjoyed this and might even see it again it definitely felt like an marvel super hero origin movie and i was okay with that
Mar 18 2019,negative,terrible wasted opportunity
Mar 18 2019,negative,so boring and plain but goose deserve get his own movie
Mar 18 2019,negative,i so badly wanted to like this movie i ended up being so bored for the first hour i think brie was a bad cast for carol she just couldnâtmt be funny also i donâtmt like how she goes from not being able to defend herself to be perfect and invincible probably my least favorite marvel movie
Mar 18 2019,positive,i didnâtmt know what to expect and i loved it marvel took a clist character that no one cared about in captain marvel and made it relevant iâtmve read all of the marvell and genisvell story arcs and i thought this was better plus my gf loved it which was nice
Mar 18 2019,negative,i have seen better movies   especially from marvel   third act was just lazy writting
Mar 18 2019,positive,i actually enjoyed this one classic escapism
Mar 18 2019,negative,it did not live up to all the hype
Mar 18 2019,positive,it was ok brie larson is not a good person for a superheroine  she had one emotion throughout and was always posing  the special effects were very well done  the cat goose stole the show
Mar 18 2019,negative,go on youtube and search captain marvel movie pitch really sums up why this movie sucked take nick fury out of the movie and its not even a watchable movie     rotton tomatoes also deleted 50000 reviews and removed features from their site just to give this movie a fighting chance
Mar 18 2019,positive,another job well done by marvel the throwback look to jackson was spot on and brie larson nailed it as captain marvel highly recommend seeing this movie
Mar 18 2019,positive,a wonderful nostalgic trip to the 90s
Mar 18 2019,positive,before watching this movie i had heard many negative reviews and comments about this movie and today i decided to do this movie justice this movie is fun the soundtrack is great good sense of humour and also great reference of the 80s and its comic books fun movie and i absolutely enjoyed it 
Mar 18 2019,neutral,its an ok movie but not one part of it needed to be made in order to see a hero come in to the marvel franchise it was added as a last minute counter to wonder woman because marvel did not want to get left behind and the random parts that have men collin women failures obscene gestures and fathers hate and their daughters is so ridiculous it literally pushed me out of the movie i dont remember any of the fight scenes after 5 minutes   unfortunately to say this movie is very forgettable it almost is like a iron man 3 just didnt need to be made
Mar 18 2019,positive,great movie  well told strong characters great humour  soundtrack couldâtmve been betterjust threw in some random but good 90âtms tunes for a soundtrack not nearly as good as the guardians of the galaxy soundtrack
Mar 18 2019,neutral,felt like i was watching top gun 
Mar 18 2019,negative,id place towards the bottom of the mcu movies maybe not the worst but close to it
Mar 18 2019,neutral,3rd attempt to review this poor excuse for a movie  all corporate and nothing original
Mar 18 2019,positive,me and family love the movie it was fun and full of action
Mar 18 2019,negative,its like nicolas cages ghost rider  but without the cool flaming bike and chain
Mar 18 2019,neutral,average to below average for a marvel movie very formulaic and very few fighting scenes
Mar 18 2019,negative,talk about slow and falling flat this would be an unfair cinematic matchup with wonder woman
Mar 18 2019,negative,huge meh on this captain marvel was not a really good character in this movie and i think it was partially due to the script and partially due to the bland acting from the actress i enjoyed some of the special effects and certain aspects of this movie but the poor acting and sometimes distracting music and humor drew away from the plot majorly  speaking of the plot there really wasnt much of it in the first place and i left the theatre feeling unsatisfied and kind of wanting more i liked the costume design for captain marvel and the young samuel l jackson makeupcg but thats as far as i can say for the costumes the antagonistprotagonist aliens just looked cheap and too puton though they sold me on their performance come on with a marvel stamp on this title i expected so much more
Mar 18 2019,positive,great movie in my opinion id say go see it 
Mar 18 2019,positive,good times love the cosmic stuff
Mar 18 2019,negative,the movie was boring and horrible the character is lifeless i was excited to see the end trailer and that wasnt as good as i expected i think this might be the end of marvel movies such a shame
Mar 18 2019,positive,great characters but the plot was meh but go see it its really good and the after credit scene was amazing
Mar 18 2019,positive,another comic movie for sure i enjoyed it and tried to avoid the politicizing drama around the main actor special effects were great and im really glad to have seen this if only to bolster the upcoming avengers plot that was my main motivation for watching this movie and i wasnt disappointed if you like comic movies youll like this one even if only to complain about it recommending a watch prior to end game
Mar 18 2019,neutral,movie was okay  the supporting characters were interesting and fun to watch  the flow of the movie such that the plot moved forward while slipping in quick flashbacks to slowly explain the amnesia was cleverly done  the main character on the other hand was not particularly interesting  i didnt particularly like her nor did i dislike her  indifference to the story of the main character made me feel meh at the end  would have loved to see a movie focused on her testpilot friend  part of the lack of engagement in the character is that i had no idea who she was and she appeared to has no weaknesses  she was courageous in the past  she was courageous in the movie  she faced no real threat during the entire film  the reveal of the plot at the end was also disappointingly predictable  the final confrontations waswere without tension  overall im glad i know the character because i am interested in how the next mcu movie will go but that interest has ebbed somewhat because her character has no flaws or weaknesses  she can snap her fingers to fight anyone
Mar 18 2019,negative,poor development of the character and poor performance of the main actress
Mar 18 2019,positive,very enjoyable movie a lack of development for carol but still very good movie all around
Mar 18 2019,positive,not one of marvels best but definitely worth a watch solid film all around if youre looking for a strong female character kicking ass and being a badass youll be disappointed this is more laid back and i think brie larson does a good job with her humor and charm 
Mar 18 2019,positive,fun familiar yet functional captain marvel delivers a solid entry of the mcu and brie larson makes us fall in love with her also nick fury steals the show
Mar 18 2019,negative,too different from comics basically avengers prequel
Mar 18 2019,positive,saw it twice this first week and couldnt get enough of sassy brie larson perfectly cast as carol danvers aka captain marvel her range runs from playful to brash to tenderness when she reconnects with bff maria and shes paired with a perfect deaged version of samuel l jackson in the setting of 90s culture sets up priceless humor of particular note is the subtle but brilliant performance by ben mendelsohn as the skrulls rebel leader he should have his own marvel comic spinoff movie opposite the hands down best character in the flick goose the cat whom steals the show if you were one of the trolls rating this marvellite less calories film less than 3stars might i respectfully suggest you go out and smell the roses despite its thorns many motion pictures are very entertaining without being oscarcaliber bl
Mar 18 2019,negative,there was so much potential for this movie but the leading lady brie larson was awful captain marvel was a good movie except for all the times captain marvel was on screen
Mar 18 2019,negative,dislike i literally dozed off during the movie maybe if the chairs were less comfortable i could have made it
Mar 18 2019,positive,a really really fun and amazing movie i enjoyed this a lot
Mar 18 2019,positive,a truly marvellous film a great film highlighting that a female lead can carry a movie without pandering to long legs and short skirts the same way frozen had the bond between sisters and didnt need the prince this kickass badass lady just needs her best friend to truly come home
Mar 18 2019,negative,just overall not very good compared to others in this genre if you want a good comic book movie with a strong heroine watch wonder woman and this is from someone that hates the dc universe
Mar 18 2019,neutral,the problem with captain marvel is the writing and also brie larson the movie itself was enjoyable but her acting is not great in the movie
Mar 18 2019,positive,captain marvel is a perfect teaser movie to endgame that holds the audience in even more suspense for whatâtms to come while also introducing a new witty character into the mcu with a interesting origin story and a set up for other movies to come
Mar 18 2019,positive,ok film but whilst the acting and overall story are good it feels a little underwhelming and lacking an emotional core which other marvel films do better   there is nothing wrong with this movie and itâtms refreshing to have a female lead played brilliantly by bree larson but like her character there is a lack of emotional clout and urgency in the movie the dramatic finale feels like a damp squib due to the lack of emotional context the main character struggles throughout the story to understand who she is and seemingly for most of the movie unconcerned by it and by the end of it the audience and her are none the wiser good concept but needs to pack a bigger emotional punch to take it to the next level
Mar 18 2019,positive,all around good film
Mar 18 2019,positive,great movie i loved everything about this movie was entertaining and captivating had plenty of action and in my opinion is a must see i would action go see this movie again
Mar 18 2019,positive,really funny and refreshing to see a female lead didnâtmt see many of the twists coming and it wasnâtmt as cheesy as i thought it would be
Mar 18 2019,negative,absolute garbage movie marvel really out did themselves with this trash
Mar 18 2019,positive,the movie was ok at best had some pacing issues and plot holes and some long dran pout boring parts overall though it was decent in term of ranking though it is one of my least favorite mcu films
Mar 18 2019,negative,i love marvel movies this movie not so much captain marvel while the super hero part of her character is cool the actress that played her showed very little emotion through out the movie other actors outshine her for sure the villain is great as well as her best friend and her child the movie is still a must see just to keep informed but its just not that good if your looking for more then action which there isnt much of either till the end of the movie 
Mar 18 2019,positive,this film doesnt deserve a lot of hate but its a far cry from amazing the performances are solid the effects are strong and there is some enjoyment in it setting up the marvel cinematic universe in a nice way but with a not so interesting title character and a heavily boring story this comic book adaptation will not leave you extremely satisfied with the end result
Mar 18 2019,positive,i really enjoyed this movie and plan to see it a second time
Mar 18 2019,positive,really enjoyed it looking forward to seeing captain marvel mixing it up in endgame 
Mar 18 2019,neutral,not terrible but not very good boring at times and i found it difficult to really care for anyone in this movie not a good characteristic for an origin movie
Mar 18 2019,negative,poorly written capt marvel movie funny st times but brie larson doesnâtmt do any character develop she has the same attitude throughout the movie and has no real fights worth noting also the skrulls are evil in the comics but refugees way to twist that simple fact
Mar 18 2019,positive,excellent movie loved it envy adams is great
Mar 18 2019,positive,i gotta say when this movie first came out i was sceptical i was very afraid that captain marvelâtms only character trait was that she would be strong like a boring superman but a woman i was wrong captain marvel is thoroughly enjoyable great humor great fleshing out of carol danvers and nick furyâtms character my only problem was the teaseract problem it showed up randomly and how it got from howard stark after captain america the first avenger to lawson in captain marvel was not a good explanation but other than that it was great i would recommend it
Mar 18 2019,negative,very average barely serviceable super hero movie i would highly recommend waiting for it to be on netflix all you need to know about captain marvel going into endgame is she is an alien and way over powered dull lifeless movie but not a 1 star i would have given 3 but we can expect more from even an average super hero movie these days
Mar 18 2019,negative,it was very bland larson and sams characters chemistry was good but the movie always felt like it was missing something also the movie had a hard time making me care about the characters
Mar 18 2019,negative,medicore at best not enough fight scenes cheesy writing way overhyped not better than most marvel movies and certainly not one of the best
Mar 18 2019,neutral,good movie mendelson jackson and law put in their usual great performances this is the first action movie ive seen with larson and she seemed flat i never felt there was any real threat to her character in the movie she is a lot more powerful than anyone she faced imagine thor versus nick fury it was obvious to me in the opening fight scene that the disc on her neck was limiting her power other than her memory i didnt see any real character arc for her the change from the comic book skrulls was a great twist and the highlight for me too many top gun parallels in her memories and all i could see with coleson and fury in the car chase scene was pulp fiction worth seeing iâtmll add it to my collection later but only because it is marvel
Mar 18 2019,neutral,i liked the fact theres no falling in love involved to show her powers but where on earth did all the strength comes from basically she is invincible and as such should not be a hero but a goddess the acting from brie larson was very poor as well i dont think that is her genre of film   the story developed smoothly but really all the demonstration of power was over the head
Mar 18 2019,negative,it was an ok movie but by far not marvels best work characters werent fleshed out enough jokes did not land and moments that were supposed to be more intense were underwhelming i dont know if it was the acting or the directing but i hope the next one is better
Mar 18 2019,positive,i really liked captain marvel i went in expecting entertainment but it exceeded my expectations now that said it is not the best marvel film ever that in my opinion still belongs to infinity war but it was a fun ride i will probably go see a few more times like i do with most marvel and star wars films there was really only one part i didnt really care for and the cgi looked bad in a few scenes but not many i was surprised by brie larson as well i havenâtmt seen her in much except 21 jump street and scott pilgirm but i liked her in this she was funny and joked around but also showed deep emotion she was also a little cocky at times so i could see her tony thor and star lord getting into it haha you know after they fix things and iâtmm sure star lord comes back but yeah i liked it iâtmm not entirely sure where i rank it yet above doctor strange iron man 2  3 thor 12 guardians 2 for sure just to give an idea
Mar 18 2019,negative,the worst marvel movie of the bunch it was so bad and disorganized it felt like a recent dc comics movie we actually left the movie 45 mins in because my 10 year old son fell asleep he was so bored we are huge fans of the marvel franchise and had heard that captain marvel plays a key role in the next avengers movie so we decided to check it out there was nothing interesting or inspiring about this captain marvel 
Mar 18 2019,positive,exciting plot twists that comically contribute to the marvel universe and add an honorable and spectacular hero to the avengers
Mar 18 2019,positive,solid marvel movie but suffers the same old origin story plot lines on discovery ones own meaning etc
Mar 18 2019,negative,this movie wasnâtmt great while there were definitely moments where marvel and fury did well on screen there were a lot of things just jammed in there  i saw the movie more based on my fear of missing out on something important for endgame but there really wasnâtmt anything i would think that would be consequential unless there is an extended version that drastically improves this one hard pass on adding it to the dvd collection
Mar 18 2019,negative,huge fan of marvel cinematic universe but this movie just sucked it wasnt very memorable since a few days after seeing it i dont remember half the scenes already there was no action scene in the movie that made me feel invested in the winner plus as a guy its hard to get into a movie where men are continuously made the villains just for being guys only saving grace for this movie was nick fury play by samuel l jackson and the special effects otherwise movie was trash and i wont rewatch it even if it was free
Mar 18 2019,positive,love this movie ive seen it twice already story is great so important for young girls and boys to see this cant wait for endgame
Mar 18 2019,positive,best solo hero movie in the mcu since winter soldierloved every minute of itloved the 90s throwbacks love nick fury as usualben mendhlson was great as talosi hope we havent seen the last of him
Mar 18 2019,negative,this movie seemed like it was only made to get captain marvel into avengers as its own movie it was boring
Mar 18 2019,negative,i really liked jude law in this movie but he was not the main character i really did not care for brie larson in this movie i just feel like samuel l jackson and some other actors were better in this movie also i did not like the movie style and the soundtrack was just off now i love tlcâtms âdont go chasing waterfallsâ but i did not think it should be in this movie thor ragnarok soundtrack was a lot better
Mar 18 2019,positive,not the best marvel movie but not the worst very entertaining and that 1st post credits scene was fantastic stan lees cameo was stupendous as well 
Mar 18 2019,negative,not good i think brie larson is a good actress but not in this kind of movie she couldnt carry the movie and her character just wasnt likeable thought i had to see this movie before avengers endgame but it wasnt needed kind of like it was ok black panther came after civil war
Mar 18 2019,negative,it was boring anticlimactic  and poorly acted
Mar 18 2019,positive,story line was good good action but i feel brie larson being a super hero about the same way i felt about ben affleck they are good in dramas but dont have the action hero charisma that makes you believe they are one 
Mar 18 2019,positive,great movie thoroughly entertaining was engaged throughout the movie fx was excellent and did not strain my suspension of disbelief great story line that fit seamlessly into the marvel universe story
Mar 18 2019,positive,i cried in this movie no joke its very heartfelt and yet it has a lot of action wow
Mar 18 2019,positive,not the strongest entry in the mcu but enjoyable and fun the main character alone is entertaining and larson brings a devilish quality to the role the sad chauvinists with inferiority complexes over women purposely bringing down this audience score because they are threatened by strong women characters finally made me register here to give a more correct score as a male in my 30s i found this interesting mostly intelligent and exciting in a light comic book way
Mar 18 2019,negative,pacing made the first hr hard to watch
Mar 18 2019,positive,another great hit from marvel
Mar 18 2019,negative,it was disappointing compared to its predecessors it didnt live up to the hype
Mar 18 2019,negative,thought the movie was marvels biggiest disappointed movie
Mar 18 2019,positive,brie larson can anger people but sheâtms not carol danvers i wanted to hate this movie based on larsonâtms negative delivery of a good idea but i genuinely enjoyed the movie despite the drama around it itâtms not amazing but itâtms not the trash portrayed in the articles iâtmve read worth watching especially because of âgooseâ the cat
Mar 18 2019,neutral,i really wanted this movie to build up to endgame but it fell flat the story moves too slow and i couldnâtmt get invested in carol danvers her struggles were very superficial so it fell flat when she developed all her powers for instance when wonder woman took off across no mans land i was almost jumping out of my seat but when captain marvel gets all her powers it was anticlimactic the end fight scene lasted like one minute yawn i really wanted to like this movie to shut up the haters but it falls in around the first two thor movies
Mar 18 2019,negative,the movie was just boring brie larson was not charismatic and its only redeeming quality was sam jackson
Mar 18 2019,positive,wow  an amazing addition to the ever growing marvel universe franchise captain marvel delivered in every way  visually stunning  amazing action scenes lots of comedic moments  a great story with a stellar cast and an overall bad to the bone movie  
Mar 18 2019,negative,i went into this movie wanting to support brie larson but her acting was too bland really ruined the actual character of captain marvel
Mar 18 2019,negative,brie larson was awful  no range no impact no expression no impression nothing  ugh  the more i think about it the more disappointed i am and i am dreading whats going to happen with endgame
Mar 18 2019,positive,i think the movie was quite good but the captain marvelcarol danvers character needs more development
Mar 18 2019,negative,marvels version of greel lantern    it felt like a retelling of green lantern the story was bland they made nick fury look like a buffoon the only good thing about it was the soundtrack which wasnt guardians of the galaxy but it was at least decent and the virtue signaling was so onthenose throughout the movie that it was laughable the most obvious example of this being where i guy asks her to smile for him being used as a retort to all the people who had complaints about the first trailer saying that she had no emotion on her face whatsoever in every shot
Mar 18 2019,negative,boring and onedimensional character
Mar 18 2019,positive,captain marvel was a ton of fun and a bit more subversive than i expected this movie is a lot more fun than the trailer would lead you to believe
Mar 18 2019,negative,even electra 2 is better or heck even catwoman what went wrong with the world for that to be true
Mar 18 2019,positive,a decent film with great showing by some supporting cast members like ben mendelsohn unfortunately the titular character never really struggles with anything during the film which makes it hard to care about her journey or worry about whether or not shell succeed and at what cost
Mar 18 2019,negative,i had high expectations from the movie the film did not surpass iron man without intrigue and plot
Mar 18 2019,positive,no spoilers    captain marvel was a pretty good movie not the best of the marvel movies but also not the worse acting was great effects were amazing of course the only downside of the movie is it was just a little slow in the beginning the end makes up for the slow beginning so just be patient
Mar 18 2019,positive,loved the movie incredible
Mar 18 2019,positive,it was a fun enjoyable movie  there are some issues
Mar 18 2019,negative,usually love marvel movies but this was hard to follow and just not interesting til the end really disappointed 
Mar 18 2019,positive,very good movie cant wait for endgame 
Mar 18 2019,positive,pleasantly surprised was better than expected good not great better than the last 2 iron man movies black panther and thor dark world
Mar 18 2019,negative,it was one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life  its awful and is an embarrassment i would highly recommend that you do not watch this at all
Mar 18 2019,positive,not exactly cannon but i still a fun ride
Mar 18 2019,negative,funny unpredictable and amusing but the films central character isnt likable the film lacks emotion and has lots of wasted potential i consider this one of this franchises weakest entries
Mar 18 2019,neutral,save up your movie tickets and popcorn money wait for tv release personally i think brie larson wasnt the perfect pick for this big role i wasnt 100 convinced she was captain marvel unlike with gal gadot where she embodies the character of ww amazingly also the story was a bit slow and a bit entangled directional wise imo just average it sometimes would remind me of guardian of the galaxy meaning i feel like ive watched this before looks very similar to other super hero movies
Mar 18 2019,positive,better than all the rest
Mar 18 2019,positive,lets hope brie larson can act better in endgame the movie was linear and rushed politics in movies do not mean anything when your lead cant act and the story is unimaginative
Mar 18 2019,positive,i dont really know what to say but i actually enjoyed the movie alot
Mar 18 2019,negative,ackwardly sitting between guardians of the galaxy and iron man
Mar 18 2019,positive,average but still had its entertaining moments everything outside of basic carol was interesting
Mar 18 2019,negative,i really wanted to like it but it fell flat for me
Mar 18 2019,negative,stupid movie story was weak main charachter was weak not an original idea at all its a green lantern rip off
Mar 18 2019,negative,it is more of a comedy than it is a super hero movie go into the movie as if it is a comedy and youâtmll have a good time
Mar 18 2019,positive,great movie everything i expected i brought back memories from the comics i had as a teenager a must see
Mar 18 2019,neutral,some cringy moments sam was pretty good the cat was awesome 
Mar 18 2019,positive,ive seen every superhero film made since the 70s this was an excellent movie in my opinion and if youre a superhero fan you definitely do not want to miss the movie
Mar 18 2019,positive,i dont know why this has such a low score  i loved it
Mar 18 2019,negative,movie was good but not compared to its peers as far as rank among all marvel movies i put it at 17 of the 21 movies released even for a origin story i wish i had more time watching captain marvel being captain marvel
Mar 18 2019,positive,i hope all of these so called fans who made all the noise about the first marvel female led superhero movie before it came out have since seen the movie and changed their tune ive seen it twice already and i loved it the first time i went was with my daughter and i loved her getting to see a female marvel superhero get more than a lite bit if screen time     but aside from appreciating that marvel is finally diversifying their roster my liking the movie has nothing to do with the lead characters gender     this was just a genuinely good supergero origin story the nods to the period it was set in were fun to relive as was the music and it bridged the gap between infinity war and endgame nicely
Mar 18 2019,negative,it was a snooz fest it was not the worst movie ever it was just so boring i will never see it again
Mar 18 2019,negative,really disappointed with way this awesome character was handled
Mar 18 2019,negative,had some cute scenes but it was so very predictable i got tired of all the flashbacks and sick of hearing white men tell captain marvel she cant do it i get it she had a bad childhood but why remind me every 10min also sad to see the skrull as the good guys considering they are planet invaders who killed a lot of superheroes in the skrull invasion series
Mar 18 2019,positive,i liked this movie i liked it in spite of brie larsen to an extent she was better than i thought she would be but i still dont think she was the right choice for this kind of role
Mar 18 2019,negative,it was realllllllly not great
Mar 18 2019,positive,fun and entertaining but not much more  i did enjoy the 90s themes
Mar 18 2019,negative,just a meh movie nothing of value to the mcu not good neither bad just a forgettable movie
Mar 18 2019,positive,a worthy and fun entry into the mcu where should  i start this film and all the controversy surrounding it has made reviewing this somewhat of a paradox iâtmll save you the backstory and cut to the film itself i had my doubts walking into captain marvel hoping to avoid getting sucked into anyoneâtms âagendaâ  truth be told once the credits rolled i left the theatre feeling satisfied and actually more excited for endgame to be honest  maybe itâtms the nod to generation x that sat dearly with me  during the films clever musical ques  maybe it was finally seeing the skrulls in full form and being just as weird creepy geeky and funny as they are in the comics and much credit goes to goose the catâbut iâtmm sorry ben mendelsohn stoke the show his quips and motives were both funny and solid heâtms just as crafty and likable as he was in rouge one as he is in captain marvel and of course thereâtms brie larson donning the role of carol danvers herself iâtmll say this right now sheâtms badass as captain marvel and not as stone and emotionless as the trailers made her out to be she belongs in the mcu and somehow the 90âtms setting worked for her character sheâtms a stern but vulnerable gen x brat if you grew up in the grunge era you know what iâtmm talking about the film uses a nice color palette of purplesgreens and of course sky blue and a young samuel jackson fury running around 1995 la was awesome to see his cgi youth was downright amazing even down to them shedding a few pounds off his frame the soundtrack rocked hell yes nirvana itâtms got some scifi elements reminiscent of the matrix and star trek but itâtms the mcu so itâtms got its own identity this honestly was a great lead on to  avengers end game and i just might see this again before that drops iâtmm glad i didnâtmt let the internet decide whether i saw this film or not i saw it for myself and walked away amped
Mar 18 2019,positive,this was a great character background marvel film thereâtms action a great soundtrack and humor definitely go see this film
Mar 18 2019,positive,it was an ok movie not my favorite but it was watchable
Mar 18 2019,negative,this movie was really a disspointment  they just proved that you can ruin even a marvel movie with all their politics smh
Mar 18 2019,positive,not bad and far from great i like it more then bp  brie larson acting is so poor and fake she is the worst part from the movie and again really dumb jokes
Mar 18 2019,negative,i can say without hesitation that captain marvel is my least favorite marvel movie
Mar 18 2019,neutral,whilst it has an interesting concept and an outstanding supporting cast it ultimately falls flack due to poor editing and an emotionless lead
Mar 18 2019,negative,worst mcu movie yet bad writing bad fights bad cgi bad lead boring craps on the source material beat over the head with feminism with no subtlety or cleverness bad all the way around sam jackson couldnt save this
Mar 18 2019,positive,i enjoyed the movie it was not in my top 10 marvel films the humor was great in the movieit just didnt blow me away like the other ones still liked it
Mar 18 2019,negative,it was a 2 hour gillette razor commercial  too many jabs at men wont take my kids to see it
Mar 18 2019,neutral,this movie was utterly forgettable but passable as a blinding explosion of presummer distraction protagonist was not interesting and showed zero character growth unlike many of the other strong female heroes like wonder woman leia ripley alita black widow etc contrary to what the media would have you believe this film doesnâtmt break any new ground it only pales in comparison to the many other incredible strong female protagonists that have been in film for many years
Mar 18 2019,positive,love the banter between captain marvel and fury
Mar 18 2019,positive,great movie brie larson is amazing loved it definitely highly recommend  cant wait for next avengers
Mar 18 2019,positive,all my friends love this movie its not so wonderful but its really fantastic and i love it too
Mar 18 2019,positive,because its an origin story all the really cool stuff happens at the end but of course it does 
Mar 18 2019,negative,as entertaining as thor 2
Mar 18 2019,neutral,so i finally went and saw the movie been hearing that the movie was bad its going to be the worse movie ever bla bla bla bla whatever  when i go into a movie i go in to enjoy the movie to see what new things theyve done from past movies this one had a lot of one hit wonder jokes in it pretty sure if i went back to see this movie i would fall asleep watching it like i do with infinity wars in all great honestly it felt like this movie was a huge mush up of a few movies like top gun spoilers alert like the cat being called goose or the space fight scene felt like i was watching the 2000 star wars movies mixed in with the hulk she was flying thru space ships it was also weird seeing sam playing the support char not use to that but he did a good job at times last thing i want to say about this movie it could of waited to be rented or bought at the store to be seen it honestly got way to much hype just like the last couple movies from marvel
Mar 18 2019,negative,saw the movie and its completely forgettable changing marvell to a old granny was bs
Mar 18 2019,positive,captain marvel was a blast full of action and very amazing vfx and cgi this movie was just fun to watch on the other hand there were a few sloppy parts where it doesnâtmt math up to other marvel movies for example fury called the organization he works for sheild but in the first iron man it wasnâtmt called shield yet there were a few more hiccups but other than that still an amazing movie my favourite parts were the skrulls shape shifting any part with nick fury and goose to add captain marvel did not seem like a captain in this movie but hopefully in endgame she lives up to the name
Mar 18 2019,positive,a great new entry in the mcu introducing a new hero that i hope will be around for many years to come
Mar 18 2019,negative,a brie larson completely out of her role film sticks out just because samuel l jackson and the cat maybe the refferences are good pulp fiction seven but the main characters arc is the worst empty story with cool cgi effects not very fond of mcu but this is even worst than thor ragnarok at least i got to laugh that time supporting cast didnt stand out either director just took a lot of cool songs from the nineties and edit them over action scenes without thinking if the song and the scene matched too bad rotten only allows me to give half a star this deserves nothing
Mar 18 2019,positive,love that this marvel actually has a plot and characters who are more than twodimensional  fx are great
Mar 18 2019,positive,captain marvel was simply a great movie brie larson did a fantastic job i do not agree with some of the other posts that say she was too rigid jackson was at his best too the chemistry between these two just worked out great humor was more reserved compared to thor ragnorok but it worked
Mar 18 2019,positive,outstanding
Mar 18 2019,negative,i was expecting so much more there were too many flashbacks and moments where the scene fell flat overall i felt this movie was dud and im disappointed that this is the new phase of marvel hopefully end game can respark
Mar 18 2019,negative,this movie puts the emphasis on virtue signalling rather then the storyline
Mar 18 2019,negative,you ever ate a meal that had no favor you look around and thereâtms no seasoning available on any tables then you report the problem to the waitress she then goes and gets the chef you sit and wait for the chef to come out and when he does he yells at you and spits in your food and your face then asks you to leave thatâtms  exactly how this film felt horrible job mcu
Mar 18 2019,negative,very disappointing  im a big fan of marvel movies but unfortunately this one is not that big of a deal indeed its the lowest in quality from their movies so far it does have its moments but in general it has a very uninspiring story bad passing boring characters behond nick fury and some very annoying plot points  the stan lee tribute was great but after that the movie got realy boring and its the most visually bland movie under the marvel brand since the last hunk movie
Mar 18 2019,negative,boring movie  the hero has absolutly no flaws cmon even superman has kryptonite and handles everything the movie throws at her with ease thats bad storytelling at its finest  there is absolutly no character progression and the story is meh  the only reason im not giving it half a star is because of samuel l jackson and jude law which both do a excelent job with the story they where given that said the scene how fury looses his eye is a slap in every fans face
Mar 18 2019,positive,i am a big fan of the mcu like all marvel movies it was ok not great i was so disappointed with the story line perhaps my expectations were to high nick furry and talos were the best part of the movie
Mar 18 2019,positive,we enjoyed the movie my 6 year old daughter really liked captian marvel she was a good role model movie had some humor we loved the cat i would recommend seeing it
Mar 18 2019,positive,hey captain marvel was mediocre the best part was samuel l jackson he was so good playing with a kitty cat they ruined a few marvel movies with continuity errors and was a very basic story they tried to be too much like star trek and guardians of the galaxy instead of being original enjoyable for a little bit and the comments throughout the movie saying america is bassicly killing immigrants and trying to wipe them out
Mar 18 2019,positive,it was actionpacked and fun it was a hit on all fronts i really cant see why anyone who loves superhero movies wouldnt outright love this movie
Mar 18 2019,positive,underwhelming compared to recent marvel films
Mar 18 2019,negative,terrible acting terrible action sequences there are zero wow moments   the movie really lost me when they went to carols friends house to find answers it became so boring and corny from there until the movie finally ended
Mar 18 2019,negative,very disappointing brie larson was not a good pick to play an action hero plot was weak and could have been done so much better this movie makes me less excited to see the new avengers
Mar 18 2019,negative,the good   the first 30 minutes they were intriguing and on the road to do some great world building the initial dynamic between law and larson was very enjoyable    ben mendelson absolutely fantastic performance that i thoroughly enjoyed i was actually not optimistic about it when he was initially cast but he proved me wrong      a couple of jokes really landed for me especially the loading joke    deaging the deaging they did for jackson and gregg was no doubt a technological achievement      the bad     style after larson returns to earth the movie loses any stylistic flavoring  even the color grading seems more like a color correction making the movie have no sense of self     sets  the sets tended to feel hollow and unlived in they felt more akin to a high quality network show than a high budget block buster     fury i know that some people will like the direction they took with furys character i on the other hand absolutely hated it the fury in this movie and the fury in the other films has a deep lack of continuity the origin of the eye patch and how fury deals with it is ridiculous and played for laughs in a joke that didnt land for me     monica rambeau an almost interesting character  her ability to be effective as a character is undermined by the writingill explain more    ronan basically gaurdians lite nothing to see hear     law fantastic in the first 30 minutes grossly underutilized in the rest of the film    the heros journey will the real captain marvel please stand up the actual heros journey in this movie takes place within 30 seconds of flashback where danvers is shown symbolically standing up against the patriarchy after failing many times ending in spoilers her removing the literal controlsuppression patch on the back of her neck ridding herself from the oppression of toxic masculinity     feminism the feminism in this movie was petulant and uninspiring in movies like black panther and wonder woman the women actually are strong and feminine they are confident and powerful the writing in this movie undermines the power of the characters actually strong woman dont have to say dont call my flying nifty again or dont call me young lady again this came across as petulant and childish and not strong a total missing of the mark imo the feminism in this movie also treats men as caricatured strawmen of everything that toxic feminists hate therefore making this film feel intellectually void     cgi the final battle cgi was terrible and distracting    larson unfortunately i still think larson was miscast i think she will be more suited to play marvel in the upcoming endgame under the direction of the russo brothers i dont think her not working in the movie was larsons fault she is absolutely a talented actress however she is best utilized when she stays in her lane     conclusion this movie should have been a character drama about identity trust and betrayal in which larson would have absolutely thrived it almost was but most was thrown out in favor of 90s nostalgia bad writing and clumsy modern political ideology
Mar 18 2019,negative,bad directing  over power like superman
Mar 18 2019,neutral,this is the first really mediocre marvel movie i thought it was okay but compared to other marvel movies it isnt that good i actually like movies like the incredible hulk and iron man 2 but this movie could have been so much better but really wasnt
Mar 18 2019,positive,it wasnt as bad as i thought it would be but it wasnt as good as it could have been
Mar 18 2019,positive,very bad wrong direction so much potential 3 stars with sam l 2 for the rest of the movie
Mar 18 2019,negative,wasnt very excited only the cat made it interesting
Mar 18 2019,positive,good movie and good actors not sure why there is so many reviews out there hating on this movie but i found it better than expected  now im looking forward in seeing the endgame
Mar 18 2019,neutral,its average at best but also entertaining not much of a personality in larsons character
Mar 18 2019,positive,i loved this film funny compassionate and the sound track was awesome  as a teenager of the nineties that was into grunge it was almost perfect   carol danvers had a lot of heart there were several great developed female characters as well as her her friendship with fury was pitched just right and no unnecessary romance just fantastic
Mar 18 2019,positive,captain marvel is a fun entertaining chapter to the mcu highly recommend this film to all marvel fans and anyone planning to see avengers endgame next month captainmarvel2019
Mar 18 2019,negative,sadly the best part of the film is the stan lee effort      story was muddled and too many tangentsand sadly felt the need to remind everyone carol is female every 5 minutes      âlook iâtmm a girl doing this and that  iâtmm a girl that stood up after falling off a bike iâtmm a girlâtm   ok we got it 1 second after she was on the screen  are there people that didnâtmt know the main character is female    aldo marvel was a dude end of story and a dumb self serving switch   kudos to benning and jackson per they carried larson on their shoulders
Mar 18 2019,negative,pretty meh probably should have waited until it came out on a streaming service
Mar 18 2019,neutral,pretty dull but ben mendelsohn was the glue that kept the ship from sinking for me   captain marvel was just a unpleasant person to be around too bad she was the main character cus she really dragged this storyjokes down with her personality  talos was the only character i really liked in the movie more his movie then captain marvel
Mar 18 2019,positive,a good origin story and a fun movie to watch with families and friends
Mar 18 2019,positive,breathtaking flawless and faithful to the source material
Mar 18 2019,positive,great movie and i loved brie larson in the role
Mar 18 2019,positive,it was everything i wanted it to be
Mar 18 2019,positive,fantastic movie dont listen to all the butt hurt needs
Mar 18 2019,negative,what a hamfisted disjointed piece of crap i cant for avengers endgame so i can stop going to these cookiecutter cgi nightmares
Mar 18 2019,positive,fantastic movie was not disappointed with the movie despite the negativity on the social media
Mar 18 2019,positive,captain marvel has such girl power that it became amazing while the plot is all over the place with flashbacks happening throughout the film it put it together with a bow and really hits into endgame     the soundtrack was nostalgic and great to jam too i seriously love her character
Mar 18 2019,negative,i found brie larsons performance to be flat and affectless the movie was enjoyable fluff otherwise  sam jackson and the cat stole the show
Mar 18 2019,positive,fantastic film best marvel origin story since iron man cannot fault it
Mar 18 2019,positive,in my opinion nice movie but nothing special i dont like brie as an actress but here shes good and obviously samuel l jackson is good as usual
Mar 18 2019,negative,it was so boring overhyped to the max the cat was the one that had at least some charisma ugh wasted money for nothing captain marvel was made to be a boring heroine sigh no more marvel for me
Mar 18 2019,positive,not the most entertaining movie in the mcu but not the least entertaining either the movie was overhyped from its announcement which probably left movie goers a little disappointed with the final movie
Mar 18 2019,positive,other than cm being a completely indestructible and in no way threatened at any point during the movie it was pretty good
Mar 18 2019,positive,absolutely delightful brie larsen has perfect deadpan comic timing for a marvel superhero cast is terrific top to bottom great use of origin story as plot it had me at altavista
Mar 18 2019,neutral,it was ok i liked how it said women are strong without beating down men well it did it a little with having all the good important people being women
Mar 18 2019,positive,i came into it like any other movie goer as it turns out its not a bad movie full of itself with feminazis all over the screen i started with it feeling cold and detached it was after the blockbuster scene that i really started to get into it earlier i would have said that larson is better suited to romcoms but i gave the character a chance and i ended up liking the movie very much like the cattenticle monster the movie wraps its self fully around the marvel movie universe and it was fun seeing characters from other marvel movies come back in this one iike most people i knew very little about captain marvel except that at one point he started out as a man and then passed the name onto a woman also as a kid i was very confused about shazam and captain marvel too only recently that word got out about this and the dc movie that i finally got the full picture as to the hows and whys if i have to pick apart the movie and look for the complaints and claims from other reviewer that captain marvel has no depth i would argue that she first presents a confident exterior to the world to hide the fact that she doesnt even know who she is even in the beginning of the last act she finally teveal to the people around her that cannot pick a side to fight for because she doesnt know her self in the end she goes with her gut as nick fury says i will confess that i was a little irked that she shot arnolds head off at the video store but in the words of others more well versed than i i digress finally as captain marvel understood that her true power was in her heart so too does this movie show it has a lot of heart i will look forward to seeing cm in the coming avergers movies and hopefully some more sequels
Mar 18 2019,positive,so og these is what movies were made for
Mar 18 2019,negative,terrible movie most bland character ever couldve casted someone alot better or just straight up made a black widow movie instead
Mar 18 2019,positive,fun movie with young samuel l jackson
Mar 18 2019,positive,great story and action packed look forward to seeing her in the next avengers movie
Mar 18 2019,neutral,certainly not a bad filmbut certainly not a particularly good  memorable movie experience either  its based in the 90s and is written like a 90s cheesy action movie too all sizzle but no sausage    thank heavens for sam l jackson otherwise i would have probably walked out of the theatre  not in protest but simply because it was just so dulla little like the lead characters personality  another â36 wasted  such funâ
Mar 18 2019,positive,i liked it alot more than i thought i would this movie embodies girl power i fing loved brie larson in this movie dont know what the big deal is over this movie
Mar 18 2019,negative,she was stiff in her acting and the feminist ideology is rampant throughout it
Mar 18 2019,positive,give you 5 cuz of the cat lov the cat part 
Mar 18 2019,positive,it was a good movie not amazing or anything but i enjoyed it
Mar 18 2019,positive,what an exceptional movie marvel doesnt again and love the tribute to stanlee
Mar 18 2019,positive,by no means the best mcu movie but still fun and worth seeing
Mar 18 2019,negative,its just okay the cgi is amazing and sam l jackson was great thats it the writing is terrible the directing is all over the place and the soundtrack is just a cheap copy of gunns style without the emotions that guardians had just really disappointing because it could have been so good
Mar 18 2019,positive,decent origin movie with some must see changes to marvel comic canon story lines
Mar 18 2019,negative,main character felt inconsistant story and side stories were good but some of the actions scenes were cut in way where you couldnt tell what was going on  edit rewatching it doesnt do it any favours 
Mar 18 2019,positive,fun movie with exciting scenes 
Mar 18 2019,negative,boring film brie larson has zero personality in this film too much politics as well not true to the actual character in the books
Mar 18 2019,negative,not the best for sure put me to sleep the only good scenes last 15min of the movie
Mar 18 2019,negative,bland origin story very unlikable and unrelatable main character uninspired action scenes and plot holes  if youre craving a good action flick with a strong female main character please watch alita battle angel or wonder woman
Mar 18 2019,positive,a film which has been cleverly created and includes humour action detailed plot lines wit intelligence and just an incredible experience
Mar 18 2019,positive,entertaining movie yet it felt like it could have been more still a decent watch for anyone on the fence about it
Mar 18 2019,positive,this movie is a heck of a lot of fun larson does an amazing job 
Mar 18 2019,positive,the movie to me was meh i didnt hate it but i wasnt looking forward to anything either so it did not grab my intrest like wonder woman and that  theme song        so i didnt hate it but i dont see it as a popcorn movie or tv show later
Mar 18 2019,positive,i absolutely loved this movie everyone gave this movie and brie larson a lot of grief before it even came out but i can honestly say i enjoyed it i feel like it was a great origin story for a powerful super hero who i cant wait to see again in endgame it was funny kept my interest and i thought brie larson was awesome as captain marvel i enjoyed seeing a younger nick fury but definitely wish i wouldve gotten more agent coulson i dont feel like their was any point in this movie either where it was trying to be something its not a go see it and give it a chance 
Mar 18 2019,negative,worst mcu movie yet
Mar 18 2019,negative,captain marvel like every other marvel movie has an abundance of impressive visuals captain marvel took a strong step forward with another female superhero which was actually a breath of fresh air from the majority of male superhero movies the downside is marveldisney is still using a repetitive formula which becomes way too predictable predictable means less entertaining overall i believe the marvel superhero genre has been oversaturating the film industry and is losing its touch and movie magic its an entertaining movie but its replay value is fairly low
Mar 18 2019,negative,probably the worst mcu movie i have ever seen and yes that does not make me sexist
Mar 18 2019,positive,it was way better then black panther 
Mar 18 2019,neutral,it was an average marvel film
Mar 18 2019,positive,support cast were great captain marvel herself though ehhh goose had  more interesting scenes talos and fury are just amazing with their sense of humour
Mar 18 2019,positive,i love it every one should go see this movie
Mar 18 2019,positive,big fan of all the marvel films some are definitely better than others i put captain marvel about the same level as captain america the first avenger i really like bree larsons portrayal as a strong confident hero with gender thankfully taking a backseat it will be very interesting to see where we go with this badass superhero thanos watch out
Mar 18 2019,positive,excellent movie finally a super hero for girls 
Mar 18 2019,positive,really dont get why some people are dissing on this yet another great marvel movie not the best of the bunch but another great one non the less overall great job of introducing new most powerful bad ass character
Mar 18 2019,negative,no hero journey no real plot somehow managed to make super heroes and space battles boring
Mar 18 2019,positive,i loved it it was very interesting and funny 
Mar 18 2019,negative,i should have listened to everyone when they said this movie was crap i shouldnt have wasted my money to go and see it for myself in case anyone is wondering this is a negative review
Mar 18 2019,neutral,brie larson gave a terrible performance cat was funny retcons were terrible plot twist didnt benefit the movie very bland plot would give a 6 but it doesnt deserve a positive rating
Mar 18 2019,positive,solid entertainment lot of heart funny and the action scenes arent exhausting and may i just say brie larson is quite winsome
Mar 18 2019,positive,absolutely loved it 
Mar 18 2019,negative,just watched this movie yes im a little late but jeez character has no emotion and only one personality trait
Mar 18 2019,positive,captain marvel rocks very good buddy movie brie larson and sam jackson have perfect chemistry ben mendelsohn is perfect as talos and goose is the number one scene stealer
Mar 18 2019,positive,not the best mcu movie infinity war still my fave but definitely fun to watch larsen is great shes a bad ass anyone who boycotted this movie for sexist reasons are not real fans of the genre get over it this makes me want the end game to start right now
Mar 18 2019,negative,brie lawson is not the right lead for this part shes trying to be a bad ass and a comedian and it comes across as a bad annoying version of tony stark and antman combined i expected her to be more like black widow in her own way and portray strength when she tries it comes off as completely unbelievable wonder woman was much better in her display of female strength in comparison as a lead superhero this was a waste of money as i just wanted to see it to determine if there was a real connection with end game there isnt 
Mar 18 2019,positive,the first feminist marvel movie could and should have been a better movie than this  in a movie called captain marvel the least interesting character was in fact her thats a sin  boring color pallet no character development poor angles and frames in more than one sequence a very slow phase i just wanted more  wonder woman rules
Mar 18 2019,negative,story line was very generic and captain marvel as a character is not fully developed but i hope in future instalment they can fix her similar to thor
Mar 18 2019,negative,over the top feminism and a weak affect for this new version super heroan made me feel incomplete out the door the effects were good not great a soso entertainment 
Mar 18 2019,positive,a good balance of story and action
Mar 18 2019,positive,not any better or worse than most of the mcu
Mar 18 2019,neutral,this movie was disappointing after months waiting i was able to see it on a thursday night prescreening at a late hour wish i saw it in the weekend everything except the skrulls fell flat
Mar 18 2019,negative,the acting was bad my wife hated it more than i did brie plain cannot act the character had no depth it saddens us that shell be in the next avengers film hopefully she got better at acting
Mar 18 2019,negative,what even is this movie wonder woman sets the standard for female leads in a hero flick hell even black widow as a backup has more charisma and demand compared to capt marvel
Mar 18 2019,positive,one of my favorite marvel movies ever 
Mar 18 2019,positive,another good marvel movie i wish there was more action and less searching for herself though
Mar 18 2019,positive,idk why this movie got such bad reviews its a great film and i for one think its a great adaptation of captain marvel
Mar 18 2019,positive,fun story that didnt feel like every other superhero movie 
Mar 18 2019,positive,this movie was amazing all the short sighted people need to get a life 
Mar 18 2019,negative,needed good acting not more forced ryan reynolds two bit lines 
Mar 18 2019,negative,very bad acting by brie larson
Mar 18 2019,positive,i was surprised went in reading all the negative reviews came out feeling they were all lies this movie was great highly recommended 
Mar 18 2019,negative,director maybe spent 5 mins designed all the story for money because no matter how shallow the story is they know you will buy the ticket anyway 
Mar 18 2019,positive,this was a really fun exciting movie which was cast perfectly 
Mar 17 2019,negative,okay movie action scenes were okay but nothing stand out nick fury was great captain marvel felt a bit flat wouldnt pay to watch  again but if it was on tv i would turn it on
Mar 17 2019,positive,our family viewed this today we all enjoyed it and are not sure what the hate is all about is it the best marvel movie no but it holds its own and we didnt feel as any feminist agenda was being forced upon us brie larsens take on the hero can come across more snarky then fun at times but again it was a fun break from reality
Mar 17 2019,positive,sense of humor and action was balanced well i enjoyed this movie and would see again
Mar 17 2019,positive,in line with the quality of marvel movies solid fights cgi story acting and tie in with the over arching marvel cinematic universe
Mar 17 2019,positive,captain marvel is a good entry in the marvel universe and brie larson is great that being said the movie need some work as a white male nothing really offended me to badly i was mildly entertained and that might be the problem marvel movies need to wow from start to finish good movie that couldve been great we need another squeal with a different director 710 movie
Mar 17 2019,negative,walking out of the theater i thought it was ok but in retrospect that characters were blah they somehow manage d to make jude law boring
Mar 17 2019,negative,sad captain marvel deserved a better movie   i donât complain about the actors i complain about the storyand the way they used music hits and the change in the intentions from some original characters good skrulls  and the poor way to introduce previous life from carol and etc etc
Mar 17 2019,negative,it was meh the lead had no facial expression or personality at all cgi was good but thats about it
Mar 17 2019,positive,carol is awesome who could ever stop her 
Mar 17 2019,negative,below average comic book movie from the mcu
Mar 17 2019,positive,goose is impeccable
Mar 17 2019,negative,it was okay maybe one of the worst marvel movies
Mar 17 2019,positive,larson and jackson are awesome  a
Mar 17 2019,neutral,wasnt a bad film but it did a few things that just kinda of annoyed such as their treatments of the skrulls nick furys eye the way they did marvell and the ending was a little boring other than that was an enjoyable movie just wasnt the masterpiece they were trying to make it be
Mar 17 2019,negative,bland movie no real storry or progression
Mar 17 2019,negative,my son is a huge marvel fan and wanted to see the movie so i took him tonight we both walked out pretty disappointed we argreed that the only worse marvel movie was hulk and he thought maybe thor dark world was worse he said the dialogue was terrible but the fight scenes were fun to me the story never made you care and the character of veers carol danvers captain marvel was one demensional she was mad and smug then smug and mad with a little brooding a poor manâtms iron man it lacked tension it lacked comedic timing it lacked the fun we are used to from marvel i liked a couple of the cat scenes i liked the stan lee cameo i liked some of the furry scenes and i canâtmt think of anything else wasnâtmt worth a regular showing ticket catch it at the dollar theater or online rental
Mar 17 2019,positive,i saw the movie today i dont understand all the negative hype behind the movie some parts werent explained very well but what movie doesnt have issues it was better than the first two thor movies and it was decent origin film 
Mar 17 2019,positive,movie sucked brie larson is so boring to watch the action scenes arent action at all this show is probably a 45 out of ten i wouldnt waste my money on this crap not to mention rotten tomatoes had to delete reviews and marvel paid people to leave good reviews this movie from a person who loves comics and marvel this is worse than the first incredible hulk movie
Mar 17 2019,positive,average mcu movie  i enjoyed it  on par with thor or dr strange
Mar 17 2019,positive,fun and inspirational not only for women but for everyone goose is awesome and i love nick fury in this film and the guardians of the galaxy characters and jude law is awesome some inconsistencies with previous entries but for me all is forgiven
Mar 17 2019,negative,cat fury and best friend pilot were highlights of movie boring story and lead character action and music were cliche
Mar 17 2019,negative,the movie was rushed leaving gaps in storyline obviously the director didnt read any of the comics   heroes background story didnt exist  action fight sequences were very lacking and boring  the evil villains just werent all that threatening to make captain marvel look powerful
Mar 17 2019,negative,bland vanilla and plain
Mar 17 2019,neutral,a good movie overall but doesnt have the same charisma of other mcu based movies
Mar 17 2019,positive,i liked so much its one of the best hero movies ive ever seen in my life
Mar 17 2019,positive,really enjoyed this while not the absolute best marvel movie to date it had a good story solid acting and wonderful musicspecial effects and sound production definitely plan to see the next captain marvel film after end game
Mar 17 2019,positive,not great shes an average looking white woman mixing with a 70 year old  s l jackson he looked like the younger of the pair bries acting skills are not great
Mar 17 2019,negative,its ok if there is absolutely nothing else playing  saw it with my 12 year old daughter tonight and she fell asleep 34 way through it  definitely not as good as most marvel movies
Mar 17 2019,positive,plus 5 more best origin story so far 
Mar 17 2019,negative,theres is major but easily unnoticed difference between a strong women captain marvel and a strong character who is a woman wonder woman  where the latter succeed in not being so engulfed in identity politics captain marvel failed miserably  that is the last thing us as viewers want to see politics engraved in films  the actions scenes werent all that great either  probably should be last on your list of mcu films to watch
Mar 17 2019,negative,this movie was really upsettingly bad for a marvel fan the movie brought nothing enjoyable really fast passed boring just all round terrible for both the action and the story dialog and in the making destroyed some of the best characters the marvel universe has to offer and some of the best villains they could of had brie larsons acting was cold and not very good in this film felt nothing from her character at all maybe its the directors fault but not a good performance in this film sorry i hope they fix this for end game or i fear the worst for future hero movies
Mar 17 2019,negative,it tried way too hard and was full of crude humor
Mar 17 2019,positive,brie larson varies from engaging and human to robotic and irritated its like someone pulls the power cord for her face
Mar 17 2019,positive,awesome  smart funny and goose
Mar 17 2019,negative,ive seen almost all of the mcu movies and have really enjoyed all of themexcept this one i was hoping for a run ride but i was bored throughout the movie the story had a lot of potential but nothing was wellexecuted except the special effects brie larson was miscast her performance is emotionally flat and uninspiring she delivers most of her lines robotically and her attitude is snarky and smug throughout captain marvel is a completely uninteresting character who is not welldeveloped and who never undergoes any significant change or growth i feel like we never really get to know who carol danvers is which is a shame the biggest shame is that captain marvel never really overcomes any significant internal or external conflicts and doesnt exhibit any significant weaknesseswhich are the two things that keep superpowered humans interesting a lot of the dialogue feels awkward and wooden except for ben mendelsohn as talos there were a couple of good jokes but most of the attempts at humor miss the mark if you want emotional connection in your superhero movies you probably wont find it here youre not missing much if you skip this one and you dont need to see it before avengers endgame
Mar 17 2019,positive,better than i thought 
Mar 17 2019,negative,just an all around weak movie  not worth the watch in a theater  weak story cringing dialogue no drama or anything at stake yawn
Mar 17 2019,positive,loved the female shero and having enough black characters to get beyond tokenism
Mar 17 2019,negative,terrible worst marvel movie since live action thor  hulk
Mar 17 2019,negative,this is the type of movie you watch once and never again   unlike other marvel movies like thor ragnarok and black panther this movie has absolutely no tension throughout being a prequel you already know certain characters are going to be alive by the end   the plot twist was a great surprise that i thought was interesting with what it could set up in the future   the mid credits scene has the only part linking it to avengers end game and if that is what you are watching this movie for i would give this a miss because of the trend of these scenes being taken from the next movie egdoctor stranges mid credit scene is the one of him talking with thor from ragnarok
Mar 17 2019,positive,solid 4 dont compare to wonder woman different universe sets the stage nicely for end game watch through the credits 
Mar 17 2019,positive,so i was hoping this would be a great movie so i could write a review telling misogynists to shut up and that its fantastic to have a strong female superhero as a leading character alas in that regard wonder woman did a lot better as a movie as a whole  the acting is not that great between brie larson poor performance and the prostheticgci on samuel l jackson to make him look younger but also give him a wooden appearance there are very obvious plot holes like wait how did they know to do that and the pacing is very uneven there are a few parts i didnt feel engaged at all  on the plus side it does fairly well as an origin story though and there is that marvel level of polish in special effects and editing but all in all it might be a necessary introduction to captain marvel for avengers end game but it is probably the weakest mcu movie to date
Mar 17 2019,positive,despite somewhat deviating from its source captain marvel manages to deliver an entertaining watch filled with lots of arse kicking  explosions and animal attack thrown in for good measure my major issue was that it felt rushed and a bit uninspiring  at times   brie larson  does a good job in depicting carol denvers character and i feel she genuinely fights like a trained warrior    this is by far the most underdeveloped of marvels origin stories   overall nick fury was epic goose was just fun to watch and the movie  does a good job in preparing us for endgame its good but could have been great
Mar 17 2019,negative,superficial and shallow
Mar 17 2019,negative,just wasnt my cup of tea i guess
Mar 17 2019,positive,honestly the montage of carol picking herself up after falling over and over again is worth the ticket price imo
Mar 17 2019,negative,this film is well below average even for a marvel film the story has no stakes in it which makes for a movie with no heart and connection the only thing keeping this move above a 1 star rating for me is the special effects which are really well done stop trying to make political statements marvel and just write good stories
Mar 17 2019,negative,worst marvel movie to date disappointed is an understatement
Mar 17 2019,positive,i dont understand all these other reviews regarding larsons emotionless portrayal of captain marvel that was the point her character development included her coming to terms with the emotions she had been taught to hidesuppress brie larson was great and as an avid marvel fan this movie lived up and even exceeded my expectations truly dont understand the negative reviews you wont regret seeing it 
Mar 17 2019,negative,this is a terrible movie terrible directing acting writing dialogs
Mar 17 2019,positive,most fun marvel movie in years
Mar 17 2019,negative,just ok a little boring until the end
Mar 17 2019,negative,boring lack of weakness and no charisma for main actor
Mar 17 2019,negative,went to see it this weekend  really boring and had lots of retcons with previous mcu movies  cat and fury hold up the film but it is probably better use of your money to wait for it to be in netflix
Mar 17 2019,positive,fun moviegreat for the whole family had a surprisingly complex story with really interesting villains
Mar 17 2019,positive,brie did a great job answered a lot of questions you didnt know you had marvel has done great bring captain marvel to life 
Mar 17 2019,positive,it was so good i think she is my new favorite superhero it tied everything together into a nice little bow to lead into everything weve seen so far including infinity war definitely would recommend
Mar 17 2019,negative,by far the driest most anticlimactic mcu movies a very boring watch overall terrible and predictable backstory stale acting by lead actors unnecessary and dry humor plot hole central and left me not wanting to see the upcoming endgame conclusion because this movie and main character was just an atrocity
Mar 17 2019,positive,did you like wonder woman  if so you will love this movie all hail brie larson
Mar 17 2019,positive,really solid entry into the mcu  i loved her attitude  like im powerful and i know it and i dont care what you think
Mar 17 2019,positive,less movies from marvel and better content 
Mar 17 2019,negative,it was hard to follow and boring female empowerment i was much more impressed by wonder woman
Mar 17 2019,negative,a less than average movie not necessary to see before endgame wait for release on netflix
Mar 17 2019,positive,i just watched the movie and was pleasantly surprised im a huge mcu fan and i came to the theater having low expectations but felt i needed to watch the film because i cannot miss any movie that builds up to the end game and boy did i enjoy the movie is it the best mcu movie certainly not but for me it is on par with other mcu origin movies like thor and antman dont believe the trolls here 
Mar 17 2019,negative,worst marvel movie since thor the dark world at least thor had a few entertaining scenes this was just mediocre the whole way through
Mar 17 2019,positive,after its all saidwent and watched itits a watchable moviebut it does over due the never could keep up with the boys and then poof she is a godi just hope she doesnt play to big of an role in the end gamebecause it took all the films to lead up to this so its kind of like wtfalso kind of disappointed how they have portrayed scarlett witch and visionthey are strait beast mode in the comics 
Mar 17 2019,neutral,i love brie larson and i think sheâtms a great actor i loved her powers her backstory and her character in general that being said and it genuinely hurts for me to say this i believe marvel put too much on her plate with the role of captain marvel i really expected more out of this movie and am now scared that endgame will be affected negatively by captain marvelâtms role simply put sheâtms not bada enough and just was not the woman for the job in my opinion on top of that the plot seemed rushed it was a bit cheesy and was not the quality that i expected out of marvel being that itâtms the movie that leads up to the biggest film in marvel history youâtmd expect it to be insanely good and thought out to reiterate i absolutely love brie larson and hate that i wasnâtmt a fan of her roll but she just didnâtmt sell it to me it wasnâtmt believable which is true with the movie as a wholeâ it wasnâtmt just her the delivery by a lot of the characters wasnâtmt believable ie some of the skrulls having human voices overall i was very disappointed and i really hate to say that iâtmm still a major marvel fan through and through and have hope that endgame will be amazing     sincerely marvel fan
Mar 17 2019,positive,not one of the best marvel movies but not one of the worst either
Mar 17 2019,positive,fun exciting inspiring
Mar 17 2019,positive,excellent movie overall keeps you entertained the whole time the plot was good and i like the portrait of captain marvel personality
Mar 17 2019,positive,this is probably the weakest mcu film that has come out since dr strange i personally cannot stand the character of captain marvel in the comics and for that matter i didnt think she was much better in the film however the story was very well done and alot of the side characters were great you probably will find something to like in this film
Mar 17 2019,neutral,sub par marvel film goodish origin film i dont think this movie would have done well wo marvel stamped on it im only mad how marvel stated that we had to watch this to understand end game yet provided little new details my theater was almost sold out opening saturday yet half the theater was empty in cleveland ohio it was pretty nice    in short this is a good netflix title  i should have watched alita instead bvs was a better movie    rip stan lee
Mar 17 2019,negative,i just want to say this movie was boring i tool my kids to watch it and they also said it wasnt that good it was the least favorite of all marvel superheroes 
Mar 17 2019,negative,dont waste your money or time
Mar 17 2019,positive,i am unsure why i read negative reviews i have scene the movie twice already and loved every second it provides a backstory for captain marvel and nick fury i loved seeing his character when it all started i felt like it helped me see him in a different light and appreciate the hero that started it all she has a special bond with him and it showed    both times i saw the movie in theatres they have been packed and reactions seemed all positive everyone walking out was admiring the film     so iâtmd say to the people with negative feedback try again and maybe stop being so cynical enjoy life and smile a bit more 
Mar 17 2019,positive,i saw all the negative hype before i saw the movie on brie larson and watched the interviews and donâtmt care for her personal values of white men compared to white women or women of color     however the quality of the movie fell right in line with the disney marvel movies the past decade great movie i know some said she was emotionless in the movie but the parts where she was emotionless were parts her character didâtmt have memory to be emotional so fit the character just fine     movie had great references humor and was a good origin story marvel has also done a great job on the last minute pr efforts to show other sides of brie larson which i commend them honestly made a difference in me seeing despite the negative for months
Mar 17 2019,positive,a great fun movie that ties up a lot of loose stuff in the mcu brie larson and samuel l jackson have amazing chemistry as partners
Mar 17 2019,positive,not bad but also not very good either i lean more towards saying i liked it but i did find it kind of boring 
Mar 17 2019,negative,it was ok id put it above the first two thor installments but it wasnt a strong standalone im excited to see her kick some butt in infinity wars 2 though
Mar 17 2019,neutral,slow preachy  holistically entertaining worth watching but wait till netflix
Mar 17 2019,positive,amazing movie seen it multiple times brie was fantastic it has a story to it like every other marvel movie that has a first film cant wait for part 2 dont hate because a women has a lead role 
Mar 17 2019,positive,the last half of the film was great and is definitely its strongest part carols developement really is great but could have been better served from a stronger first half brie larson herself was great as carol when the script let her especially the drama driven scenes but gets held back by the control your emotion aspect of the film it makes sense in the context of the film but does leave a lot to be desired the rest of the cast was great and bries banter with samual l jackson was a welcome edition to the mcu the hand to hand combat scenes are shot poorly and edited really weird making it a less smooth experience however the last act of the film more then makes up for it with its long takes and wide shots overall not as strong as other films in the mcu but definitely good the film holds a lot of potential and makes me eager to see carol in the larger mcu
Mar 17 2019,positive,loved the costume  loved the story  loved the powers    mild woman empowerment towards the end of the movie but they arent even over the top  definitely doesnt feel like a feminist movie    the cat is dope  hate to say it because this will get blown out of proportion but captain marvel was a little flat at times but still dope  not as dope as that cat though    excited for her to meet the avengers
Mar 17 2019,negative,decent marvel movie i should have waited till home release though
Mar 17 2019,neutral,i really feel this character had a poor character arc not enough back story it came across rushed and predictable fight scenes were poorly executed and came across as unbelievable and unattainable as she was able to fly through an entire fleet was just too over the top she herself comes across as brash and unlikable you would not be rooting for her she just has an underdeveloped character arc it was like trying to make guardians of the galaxy tries to be a badass superhero just didnâtmt work also far too much sjw undertones  overall it was meh
Mar 17 2019,negative,i hate to say this but the movie lacked any real character building that i have come to expect from the mcu she literally goes through the movie being overpowered without any real strife or anything that would make you invested in her as a character
Mar 17 2019,neutral,entertaining and enjoyable like most mcu films but eminently forgettable the biggest issues that put this towards the bottom of the heap for mcu are the script which provides no character arc for the protagonist and brie larsons oddly onenote performance which seems better suited for a nike commercial than a feature length film
Mar 17 2019,positive,not the best marvel movie ever but still good 
Mar 17 2019,positive,fantastic movie most of the bad reviews the ones that rate it a half or onestar are the butthurt manbabies that dont understand what the word diversity means
Mar 17 2019,positive,this should be rated a lot higher would love to see the difference in male and female ratings see this movie and take every little girl you can find
Mar 17 2019,positive,entertaining movie  im interested in seeing more captain marvel cameos and full length movies
Mar 17 2019,neutral,the weakest storytelling of an origin story in the mcu  you feel nothing for any of the characters the action is nondescript and if the origin story was told in 5 minutes youd miss none of the drama from the movie because there was none
Mar 17 2019,negative,i honestly had high expectations for a hypedup mcu movie and i was unfortunately let down i watched it with a group of friends and most of us can agree it was a fantastic bore acting is subpar no classic marvel humor cgi was awful and the action sequences were uninteresting would not recommend going to the theaters to watch i was extremely disappointed
Mar 17 2019,negative,giant disappointment worst mcu movie for sure spend your money elsewhere
Mar 17 2019,positive,great back story excellent character development a relatable lead and all the action you expect combine to make this one of my all time favorite marvel movies
Mar 17 2019,negative,this movie fell a little flat i didnt like the way they did the skrulls and kree it didnt jive with the comics i read when i was younger some of the social interactions between the characters felt forced hopefully they can find a good groove in the next movie but this one just wasnt that great im a huge mcu fan and have about every mcu dvd but im not planning on getting this one when it comes out
Mar 17 2019,negative,honestly kind of boring and the main skrull guy was a way better actor than the main actress
Mar 17 2019,positive,i went into this movie loving the mcu but not knowing who captain marvel was  her character or her story i also went in without spoilers all i knew was that there is a cat whose name is goose and the cat is important     the story did not disappoint at the beginning i did not know where they were planning on taking the story it was fresh and exciting different from the other marvel movies ive watched before and trust me ive seen them all i was intrigued by vers and her absent memories and found the payoff so rewarding the plot twists were not contrived shocking but still wellplayed    the action scenes were fantastic the fight scenes were beautifully choreographed and the cgi and chases were exciting and well done     the music did what it was supposed to do either unobtrusively add to the experience or when they added some 90s nostalgia pump up the excitement and set the scene    some parts of the movie moved a little fast but i also generally watch movies with closed captions so if i had had those it would almost certainly have helped
Mar 17 2019,negative,truly a poorly thought out character with no direction in the movie wonder woman did it better
Mar 17 2019,positive,we loved it  as a mom of two teenager daughters it was a treat to watch a story about a strong female super hero that fit within our favorite marvel universe now we just need a black widow movie
Mar 17 2019,negative,anyone who rates this as anything other than average is either being very lenient or has a political opinion to push the truth is its a very average marvel movie with some fun moments brie larson however is the most uncharismatic lead actress i have seen in a long time it may have been the directing or the writing but my god she is not likable at all here the side characters save the movie from totally sucking especially jackson and mendelsohn if youre looking for a strong female superhero go watch wonder woman
Mar 17 2019,negative,boring movie no better than avengers 2
Mar 17 2019,neutral,decent story its a bit too sentimental it takes too much time getting to the face the enemy part and spends too little time dispatching them 
Mar 17 2019,positive,the movie was great you will not disappointed
Mar 17 2019,positive,if anything is true after 21 films set in the marvel cinematic universe its that kevin feige and marvel studios know exactly what theyre doing they are incapable of making a bad movie and as comic book movie fan i truly cherish that fact and look forward to their latest work two or three times a year    but if were being realistic not every single one of these can top the one that came before it in terms of quality sometimes we just have to be happy with the fact that the latest film is pretty darn good and captain marvel is one of those films    captain marvel will stake its place in the franchises history for being the first mcu film with a solo female lead this is a long overdue and refreshing change of pace but the films originality and freshness mostly ends there sure theres a 90s setting and a remarkable cat who may or may not be an actual cat but the story operates within a world were pretty well familiar with by now and hits all of the standard beats for a marvel origin film filmmakers anna boden and ryan fleck try to toss a little twist into the mix but shame on you if you dont see it coming from a mile away    but when captain marvel really works it works largely in thanks to the tremendous cast led of course by oscarwinner brie larson i was initially skeptical of larsons work here due to some wooden line delivery in the films trailers and theres definitely some of that throughout the film but she really wins you over by the time carol danvers story really gets underway in the finished film    even more remarkable though is the supporting cast surrounding larson samuel l jackson gives his best performance as nick fury yet with the aid of some astonishing deaging special effects work to effortlessly make him appear to be over 20 years younger the same effects on clark greggs young agent coulson arent quite as effective though annette bening kills it in a mysterious dual role that i wont spoil more info on here and ben mendelsohn is delightful as the leader of the shapeshifting skrulls along with great work from the likes of jude law lashana lynch and gemma chan i mean if the quality of this cast isnt enough to convince you to see this movie i dont know what is    i think it goes without saying that a lot of viewers will be flocking to this to learn more about the character who might be destined to save the world from thanos in the upcoming avengers endgame  and you wont come away disappointed on that front if you stay for the post credits scene  but i left the movie absolutely shellshocked by her overwhelming power after it fully blossoms in the films climax its definitely fun to watch but itll be interesting to see how it is handled in future films because shes so powerful that she runs the risk of being a hero were never truly concerned about heres hoping they find her version of kryptonite quickly    and i know this will pain a lot of the trolls out there hoping this film would be total flop but sorry boys  captain marvel is a perfectly delightful two hours at the movies it doesnt reinvent the wheel but its got a great mix of thrills laughs and spectacle all to the tune of the best soundtrack since guardians of the galaxy this might be middle tier of the mcu but even that is a guaranteed good time
Mar 17 2019,negative,very tough to sit through itâtms a shame that they had to put this movie in between infinity war and end game since it made made watching this movie seem like a chore that i had to do in order to fully enjoy avengers rather than a fun movie outing
Mar 17 2019,positive,i enjoyed the movie i dont understand why people trying to make it sound bad but its pretty good for me
Mar 17 2019,positive,the pacing was a little slow but otherwise a great film
Mar 17 2019,positive,very solid with a couple weird storytelling flaws
Mar 17 2019,negative,even though repeating some tiring flashbackssssssss  captain marvel still struggling to know herself but remembering her pastthat irritatingly repeated flashback instead character itself still unable to prove how strong she is and what she capable of despite of pushing away and flying through ronans ships and the dc styled eye glowing scene are annoyingly intimate satisfyingly surprised with its humours and the smooth connection to end game timeline its not the best mcu movie its good but its below average of mcu movies it can be worth watching if you really thinking of how captain marvel are connected to upcoming avengers end game
Mar 17 2019,negative,mediocre at best and because im the best isnt good enough nothing the hero gains in the movie is earned so in short this movie gave me cancer
Mar 17 2019,positive,captain marvel is a joy throughout there was no moment or scene in the film where i was ready to move on to the next scene because i wasnt enthralled maybe spoiler there was no love interest in this film and i didnt notice until days later thinking back on it and that fact just gave me an even greater love for this film it was about her and her life and her relationships with her ba friends to all the haters of this film i only say i have nothing to prove to you
Mar 17 2019,positive,it was so good it did not have an over the top feminist agenda it was just a powerful girl doing what she needed to do to get the job done very funny and a very nice tribute to stan at the beginning would recommend to all very action packed and goose was pretty cute as well
Mar 17 2019,negative,the most disappointing movie in the mcu brie larsons performance is bland and the writing is horrendous
Mar 17 2019,negative,honestly the only good thing about this film is one of the first fight scenes and the music selection even thjough one of the songs was produced after the time period
Mar 17 2019,positive,great movie i would definitely pay to see this movie again on the big screen 
Mar 17 2019,positive,great addition to the mcu the fact that this bandwagon of haters keep reviewing with nothing to back it up worst movie ever such a feminist backing who cares stop bring politics into entertainment if your a mcu fan you will enjoy this film 
Mar 17 2019,positive,good action and humor larson fits role well and has on screen comedic chemistry with slj ended a little abruptly but like the play into the next avengers movie
Mar 17 2019,positive,exciting and fun but im beginning to feel like the marvel universe is feeling a bit tired
Mar 17 2019,negative,i really wanted to like this movie unfortunately  my wife and i were unimpressed  the first quarter is good and after that is a boar and inconsistent with the marvel universe samuel jackson was great as usual as were the special effects  not worth the money
Mar 17 2019,positive,it was decent for an mcu movie it kind of felt like a phase 1 movie though her powers looked pretty cool but the movie overall didnâtmt really seem like it could figure out what it was trying to accomplish or wanted to be other than create a feminist superhero icon
Mar 17 2019,negative,this movie was just not good at all for many reasons which ill try to list now  humour  the usual marvel movie humour that helps to brighten up the tone and switch up the pace is completely lacking  makeup  the makeup for samuel l jackson to make him look younger is really bad and distracting  special effects  the cgi was not up to par with previous marvel movies in her powers and also the kree skrulls and cat creature  acting  brie larsons acting was just so bland and monotone i cant think of a single time anything she did made any emotional impact  storyline  felt so repetitive and boring the whole she doesnt need her powers to be strong and her human side is not a bad thing have both been done so many times before see thor and starlord for examples in the marvel cinematic universe  pacing  the plot just feels rushed and no characters get any real time to show why we should care about them  action  the action for lack of a better word was boring some poorly choreographed hand to hand combat some laser guns and thats about it i think her superpowers make it very difficult to make an intense action scene  overall i was thoroughly disappointed with this film and thats coming from someone who was originally not going to watch it at all as the trailers did not interest me at all i feel that what they where going for making a superhero more aimed towards the female demographic could of been done so much better with a more established actress who actually seems interested in the role and a more original storyline after seeing this i hope her involvement in the upcoming avengers endgame is minimal although maybe with better writers they could improve the character however im really unsure brie larson has the acting range to pull that off
Mar 17 2019,positive,i loved it i really loved how it was both feminist and superhero themed its like i got progressive and social critical thinking while also giving me a healthy dose of kick ass action  loved it near the end i got goose bumps at one point because of how well the scene transitioned it was emotionally impactful  gotta say sometimes some stuff felt a bit forced but personally i only felt that for like one scene  definitely recommend only to open minded people though cause some might be a teensy bit biased
Mar 17 2019,positive,it was okay  its a nice addition to the marvel movies i didnt like the original marvell played by a woman instead of a man that does not take away from the power of carol danvers in fact it probably makes her even more awesome as a more powerful successor the fact that she is female should be second to that  without wanting to spoil anything i didnt like how nick fury lost his eye  i also didnt like how the skrulls were portrayed midway through the film its nice to see another side to characters but these guys are really important as bad guys in the marvel universe i mean secret invasion is all about the skrulls  anyway not bad but it seemed a little fluffed up a bit  to be clear im happy shes here but im most interested in how her powerful and unique abilities play into avengers endgame and this movie doesnt really seem to address that but sure it was fun
Mar 17 2019,negative,main actor is rather bland and not enough was put into her character development  you just dont really care about her character all that much  she has no weaknesses or flaws that she must overcome a missed opportunity for people to relate to her  fury and a cgi cat provide a lot of fun but mendelsohn really carries the drama aspects of the movie  its not a bad movie but it feels very empty compared to other marvel films
Mar 17 2019,positive,while it wasnâtmt my favorite marvel movie of all time it has a great story and some really inspired moments seeing the kreeskrull conflict reinterpreted for the mcu was pretty thrilling and the more indepth look into the kree was great brie larsen brought a lot to the role humanizing an iconic marvel character and making her very relatable definitely worth seeing on the big screen
Mar 17 2019,positive,captain marvel is a pretty good movie that truly i was expecting be very good but not this truly wonderful to watch  i just loved every scene between the kree and the skrulls it was so out of this world to see these two enemies fight in space and on strange planets as they fight each other on planets talos ben mendelsohn was definitely a surprise as his character is just amazing in the movie captain marvel is also a warm welcome to the marvel cinematic universe brie larson is captain marvel as she truly is the defined carol danvers on the screen samuel jackson is truly at his best as nick fury is truly the nick fury defined by comics its the duo that truly rocks on screen as they are simply amazing to watch together on screen the score by pinar toprak is amazing to listen to form start to finish captain marvel has many amazing moments of action and wonderful moments of joy that make wonderful nods to her comics itâtms a wonderful comic book movie with wonderful acting and a wonderful soundtrack and a wonderful heroine that will be a welcome new heroine for the next era of marvel movies
Mar 17 2019,positive,very enjoyable sly humor and lots of twists  nick fury with hair we will definitely be watching this again
Mar 17 2019,neutral,mediocre movie funny moments with the cat and some banter was entertaining but the serious scenes were bland and meaningless and the fight scenes were inconsistent
Mar 17 2019,positive,this isnt an ordinary superhero origin movie so much hype has been made around captain marvel and her place in avengers endgame its hard to know if theres anyone who doesnt really know who she is walking into the cinema the movie has you covered if you have been avoiding trailers and news  although we are chucked into the action straight away and the backstory unfolds through flashbacks is this the funniest marvel movie no although carol danvers is at her most likeable whilst cracking a joke or yelling back at a screaming enemy in the heat of battle is this the coolest marvel movie there are cool moments and each person will take their own take away from it is it a good marvel movie as a marvel fan who came to the party late but caught the avengers in the cinema on the weekend of release but waited for ant man and the wasp to come out on bluray i can tell you  yes this is a very good movie there are a lot of strong female characters in this movie and as a mid 30s white male i am not offended nor intimidated by that in fact i was cheering along with the rest of the audience
Mar 17 2019,neutral,way too unrealistic towards the end a good story up to that point
Mar 17 2019,positive,just got back from the movie    amazing ost great acting well written humour go see the movie âtm
Mar 17 2019,negative,the movie itself was nothing but an overall boring piece of garbage that was trying to be wonder woman but instead became the idiot version that is getting special treatment as if it is the first movie ever with a female lead when in fact it isnt and should have either neither been made or at least gotten compatent directors and a better female actress to play capyain marvel or better yet marvel should have made a black widow movie
Mar 17 2019,positive,this movie was great  i loved it like the first captain america  confused as to why there is a little bit of haters going on but to each their own      i would recommend it to everyone
Mar 17 2019,neutral,another typical entry into the bloated marvel cinematic universe  a paint by number comic adaptation with little at stake in the overall storyline      the 90s nostalgia seemed a bit forced and sappy  the 90s wasnt that great of a time  the references to blockbuster and radio shack were kind of cool  would have been better if they were still in existence  i had the urge to visit blockbuster after watching this movie
Mar 17 2019,negative,sound mix wasnt even sounds that should be loud were quiet and vice versa 12  visuals cg wasnt believable for the most part furys face was perfectly recreated and amazing set was done right to the theme of the 90s 34  story failed to create emotional connection to captain marvel she was over powered and stonefaced which made me feel like she had nothing to lose comedy was a hit or miss in the end i was wishing the movie would end to improve this movie i would give marvel her own kryptonite instead of being omnipotent creating an achilles heel to give the story more suspense 1
Mar 17 2019,negative,shaky story line and disney influence makes me very concerned about end game james gunn firing is a tragedy and its effects are illustrated in this movie which i would say rivals dc films marvel superiority is a thing of the past 
Mar 17 2019,positive,fantastic movie that stands out as a superhero origin and action flick well rounded and thoughtful characters with lots of great character moments and dialogue i left with stars in my eyes
Mar 17 2019,negative,didnâtmt really like the ending it seemed like captain was being mean
Mar 17 2019,neutral,the movie was mediocre in my opinion i felt captain marvel had bit to many cringy parts and lame jokes in itthe action scenes were not fun the watch some parts that were good felt rushed while bad scenes felt slow  best parts of the movies is samuel jackson amd goose i did enjoy seeing the friendship aspect between maria and carol danvers i felt they could have done mar vell better like gave more screen time etc thats just my opinion i would recommed people to watch the film and developed their own opinion about
Mar 17 2019,positive,awesome movie to see over and over
Mar 17 2019,positive,thought it would be sexist garbage thankfully it wasnt not the best marvel movie ever but far far from the worst been a captain marvel fan since the 90s and will still be going strong not bad larson not bad
Mar 17 2019,negative,terrible fighting camera work and lighting no main character arc kinda ignores historical canon positives samuel l jackson jude law and ben mendelsohn
Mar 17 2019,positive,to be honest the movie had its good moments feel kinda flat on some i blame the script for feeling like had a few forced moments
Mar 17 2019,negative,the movie was boring and a waste of time brie larson was horribly miscast and completely unlikable i do not understand how she was cast with all the other talented actresses that could have killed this role
Mar 17 2019,positive,the character arc for talos was exceptional so the screenwriters are definitely capable of writing interesting characters so i guess they just chose to make the title character boring and uninspired
Mar 17 2019,positive,this movie was just as good as any other marvel origin movie i dont understand some of the hate other than the fact that a strong woman is in the lead role the lady they picked to portray captain marvel did an excellent job also spoilers but it does connect to the overall avengers lore and sets the stage for endgame
Mar 17 2019,positive,this movie shouldnt be getting all the backlash it is for one thing i was on the edge of my seat a lot of the time sure there where a few plot holes but for the sake of it it was really entertaining i avoided any trailer i could when it came to this movie so the twist in it i was flipped a 180 again i have no clue why it got the hate it did and in my opinion this movie was way better than dcs wonder woman 
Mar 17 2019,negative,the movie suffers from bad pacing and a protagonist who breezes through every fight every problem just overall a weak character stuck in a story where the bad guys are clearly not bad guys the music choices were off and im not sure why only men were telling danvers negative things and oh my god the dumb montage of her standing up at 5 different ages after countless flashbacks in the movie of her falling down come on oh and no doubts im just a girl song did not fit the 2nd to last fight the biggest crime is agent colson being relegated to such a small role
Mar 17 2019,negative,lame duck  wonder woman was 100x better and felt far more organic
Mar 17 2019,positive,ignore online ratings scores too many trolls out there this is a great movie if you like marvel movies 
Mar 17 2019,positive,i enjoyed this film it provides many missing pieces of the marvel time line
Mar 17 2019,neutral,a somewhat intricate superhero origin story that falls short because of the main characters wooden performance it doesnt propose anything new to the genre but it would be devoured by the marvelites as its the next installment on the saga
Mar 17 2019,positive,marvel movies are all about a couple of hours of escape for me and i was quite happy how this movie provided that escape particularly given some of the publics reviews samuel jackson brie larson and the cat all provided plenty of laughs kudos to marvel in their ability to always tie the loose knots
Mar 17 2019,positive,might just be my favorite marvel movie watched it once and knew it was top 5 watching it a second time might be number 1 only avengers and infinity war take a higher slot its not the funniest one but guardians ragnarok and antman make that hard to overcome solid message and i think they did the female lead perfect sent the message of the movie without directly making a big deal that shes a woman that allows the message to be delivered to a wider audience while still having that female role model    i dont tend to rate movies and im biased as im in love with the mcu but with all the unnessicary negativity i needed to stand up for this fantastic addition to the ever growing mcu
Mar 17 2019,positive,after hearing loads and loads of reviews and people coming up to me that havent watch captain marvel says alita was better than this i decided to do this movie justice this movie is way better than i expected love the humour the comic reference it has and also 80s references and i absolutely love the connection and relationship between the characters again love it
Mar 17 2019,positive,i felt this was one of the better movies to come out of marvel studios latelythey should use that cat flerken in more moviesd
Mar 17 2019,negative,how is this movie making money  i sat through two screens  the theater had me and two other people in it  i kept falling asleep but couldnâtmt find any peace and waking back up iâtmd like to write a better review but iâtmll wait for a better film to review
Mar 17 2019,positive,this movie was fun brie larsons character was relatable and interesting the action and reveals were exciting and timely and the story was intriguing and built well into the story
Mar 17 2019,positive,way better than some  of these other posts give credit for i may not agree with some of the actress personal decisions or comments but its a good film
Mar 17 2019,negative,nothing like the comic 
Mar 17 2019,positive,great movie beginning to end far exceeded my expectations
Mar 17 2019,negative,there was no like no action
Mar 17 2019,positive,wonderful film  made me think of superman when i was 5
Mar 17 2019,positive,i went to see this film not expecting much but after leaving the cinema i was shocked good story with great use of the commonly used amnesia trope good plot twists and  decent character arcs not perfect but an amazing entry to the mcu
Mar 17 2019,negative,second half of the movie is garbage for sure
Mar 17 2019,positive,really enjoyed the film
Mar 17 2019,neutral,this movie served merely as an introduction to the captain marvel character marvel did right to position the release right before endgame otherwise many people wouldnt have considered it larsons acting was disappoing even considering my expectations after the trailer the entire movie is a roundabout way of showing her power evolution but regularly demotes her power for the sake of plot see not being able to fight hand to hand but sniping spaceships at 300mph 255 cant recommend btw if youre watching for endgame context save your time and money theres nothing here
Mar 17 2019,positive,ot was a great movie i was entertained the whole way through
Mar 17 2019,positive,could have been better  sfx were well done but the story was disjointed  brie larsonâtms line delivery was less than believable which is disappointing given her acting history  samuel l jackson did a great job as always i wish they would have expanded more on ronan and the accusers  greatly under utilized
Mar 17 2019,neutral,this movie was pretty bland and i felt it was just a filler so marvel could put out another movie in between infinity war and endgame it is an easy pass unless you want to watch every movie in the infinity saga
Mar 17 2019,negative,easily the worst movie that marvel has ever made i gave it a chance and went to the theater just in case it was decent but the movie did not even reach that i agree with everyone saying that captain marvel or brie larson was portrayed as a character that you wont care much about there was so many things wrong with this movie character development was not even there whatever was shown was very mediocre and hard to believe what happened to you marvel
Mar 17 2019,positive,engaging story enjoyable characters and plenty of comedy
Mar 17 2019,neutral,very onthenose some of the scenes are really cringe i expected more from a marvel movie with their budget and access to talent they couldve done a lot better brie larson had some good scenes in there but it felt lacking the movie was too far up its own ass to smell the coffee they focused too little on being a super hero and too much on false claims of feminine struggles not sure how to better word that the movie tries to be too political and less actionbasedkickasssuperhero they also ruin some of what couldve been really cool stories in the mcu like how fury lost his eye or the name avengers came from except no they had to jam as much humus up their own shawarma as they could i thought i had to see this movie before i watched endgame and was sorely mistaken
Mar 17 2019,neutral,while i will admit that it was better off than the word has been on the film it does make for a film where the star isnt that memorable as say wonder woman was the acting of young nick fury and maria were very well seeing the changes from young nick to the one we know is a breath of fresh air heck even the big bads had a great performance but sadly a lot was lost with the acting of veerscaptain marvelcarol but the secret to furys eyepatch was very anticlimactic which really bummed me out watching in the theater there were moments that were trying to be funny when it didnt call for it and moments it did feel a bit too preachy and was pretty bland because of it or the corny liner from the little girl i wish i could say the climax was epic but there just wasnt enough character there to attach to partly because the whole amnesia thing is pretty lack luster for a main character imo there wasnt any tension which is needed and the irony of the cat garnering more laughter and commotion than the rest of the movie combined  i have to say it is an average film at best with some nice things and a lot of inconsistency captain marvel can bust through solid metal and concrete with ease but any time she hits a living thing they get thrown a bit leading to some real disconnect when the movie states she cant control her powers yet so she cant really be able to hit them less and would lead to a big plot hole but plot armor  but the worst of it all is this could be the last movie with a stan lee cameo and that saddens me that his final moments in the films could be in an average film like this
Mar 17 2019,negative,after everything with larsons woke ways i still decided to see the movie hoping for an average experience i was wrong the movie was almost a skeleton of any other super hero movie badddddd
Mar 17 2019,negative,wont be seeing this one again acting was terrible and brie larson failed to capture the character at every turn you know its bad when even the voice over during cgi fight scenes are unbelievable disney should have made this a short mini movie that aired before endgame and just gave a quick backstory to capt marvel wont be adding this to our marvel collection
Mar 17 2019,positive,super fun movie when taken and viewed as its own solo story it was a great watch now im excited to see it tie into the rest of mcu
Mar 17 2019,positive,awesome movie it really spoke to me and does a good job developing carol fury coulson and maria we also get closer to unraveling the many places the tessaract i think thatâtms how you spell it has been a little bit more development on yonroggs motives would have been nice though
Mar 17 2019,positive,it was amazing action packed and had suspense loved it
Mar 17 2019,neutral,im a huge fan of the mcu and i really wanted to like this movie but it just didnt do it for me so much was going on that it made it pretty boring at times
Mar 17 2019,negative,going into captain marvel my expectations were low in this case my low expectations were met captain marvel as a film feels hollow a film without meaning captain marvel touches on a number of themes but never sticks to one and develops the plotline brie larson carol danverscaptain marvel gave a performance almost unidentifiable from her usual work the direction of the character was unclear danvers never changes throughout the movie and seems to be flawless in all aspects larsons cheap imitation of tony stark came off as unlikable and arrogant the inconsistency of the performance could be based on the poor direction of the film duo directors  anna boden and ryan fleck have never directed a blockbuster of this magnitude some hiccups are expected this also speaks to marvel studios as a whole selecting directors they can use in their favour some solid performances from ben mendelsohn talos and samuel l jackson nick fury gave me moments of laughter and enjoyment in this film the future of this character depends on the production behind her larson is an incredible performer but this film just was not up to par dont even get me started about the cat
Mar 17 2019,positive,a wellpaced story with lots of good twists and one that says something we all need to hear now and then when life knocks you down get back up thoroughly enjoyed this ride
Mar 17 2019,positive,this is the movie that carol danvers would have wanted    captain marvel has a fairly complicated origin story there are a lot of moving pieces even before she got her powers while its important to marvel history im not sure putting the entirety of the kreeskrull war into that engine was a great idea but somehow they managed to get a great payout from it    while its true to the comics the memory loss carol suffers from seems to take away from time she could have been spending growing as much a human hero as she did a kree warrior the movie really picks up steam when she has other characters to really bounce off of    while the movie overall was good the scenes of fury interacting with goose make me want to go back and watch it again right away
Mar 17 2019,positive,it was entertainig and fun a nice appetizer before end game   pleas stay for the 3 end credit scenes they are worth it
Mar 17 2019,negative,predictable plot horrible execution and very unlikeable characters
Mar 17 2019,positive,another exceptional marvel movie perfectly introducing a long awaited mega powered character into the ongoing avengers storyline  a well crafted and balanced film throughout
Mar 17 2019,positive,not one of marvels best works but it was still an alright movie they focused too much on the heroine idea almost every scene ended up with a corny smile from larson and superhero theme in the background which made me cringe each time it almost made me feel like i was watching the power rangersand you dont really get lost in the movies story but hey anything marvel beats dcs patchy cgi effects like in that aquaman trash but im not taking anything away from the performances larson and l jackson had good onscreen chemistry i just cant wait for avengers end game 
Mar 17 2019,positive,it was as solid origin movie and it wasnt the feminazi movie like people said
Mar 17 2019,positive,love this movie people who donï 12 12tmt like it usually have an agenda
Mar 17 2019,positive,i dont know why ratings are so low on captain marvel i watched it on sunday and its just as entertaining and any other marvel movie brie larson does a great job with captain marvel if youre out for great entertainment you wont be wasting your money here go see it make up your own mind
Mar 17 2019,positive,origin stories are difficult to pull of in any genre but marvel managed it here creating a likable inspiring character who goes through an interesting development arc over the course of the film its not as funny as many recent marvel flicks and the fight scenes are not as dazzling but the story  characters are rocksolid also it is directed written  produced by women making this a landmark film of the genre
Mar 17 2019,positive,i watched the movie in 3d without any prejudices because of any actor involved here    the movie was great cgi is one of the best so far and the humor is great it reminds a bit of guardians of the galaxy the plot is nothing special but absolutely ok the cast is great and as expected it was a high quality movie would watch it again    picture 55  sound 55  plot 45
Mar 17 2019,positive,i loved the movie i plan on seeing it again before it leaves theaters
Mar 17 2019,neutral,quite disappointing pretty boring
Mar 17 2019,negative,donâtmt think iâtmm biased or anything i walked into that movie genuinely excited and i hated it the beginning was good and then you have the longest period where itâtms so boring and then you have the end fight that was so underwhelming the cgi was horrendous especially with the cat and a scene where carolâtms falling
Mar 17 2019,negative,bad movie bad script poor history
Mar 17 2019,negative,brie is not a good actress i have loved the actors of all the other superhero movies disappointed
Mar 17 2019,positive,not the best marvel movie ever but a solid backstory thatll be very important for mcus future
Mar 17 2019,positive,although it seems like this is a female empowerment movie it touches more on the immigration issue going on at this time it was hard to follow along with characters from other movies poorly integrated into this marvel movie i did enjoy and humor was very strong great family movie 45
Mar 17 2019,negative,the movie is super monotone and boring i laughed maybe twice
Mar 17 2019,positive,it was a fun movie that had a little of everything it fits right in with the mcu and tied a lot of loose things together
Mar 17 2019,positive,poor character choice mediocre acting utterly  predictable and i loved it anyway  did i mention the f22 raptor in the 1996 airplane hangar
Mar 17 2019,negative,really bad character writing and charecter development just meh
Mar 17 2019,negative,i found myself focusing on the origin story of nick fury over captain marvel as captain marvel as played by brie larson was not likable or fun
Mar 17 2019,neutral,felt like the movie had potencial but it was misused the core of the movie is bad its story telling and the pacing of it
Mar 17 2019,neutral,with a story that moves too fast and with several new characters that do not even give much to know with this movie captain marvel does not feel like the most powerful mcu
Mar 17 2019,negative,boring not interesting
Mar 17 2019,positive,im so glad i go to see the movie and ignore the bad reviews this movie has one of the best space scenes i ever scene also i love how the movie start slow not in a bad way and then it gets better and better i love it
Mar 17 2019,positive,while not destined to become a classic like many of its mcu siblings captain marvel still solidly delivers on the action comedic and just plain fun fronts for anyone who lived their youththrough the 90s its also chock full of nostalgia and the inspiration montages when captain marvel fans he great moment of adversity is one every little girl  nay every child should see
Mar 17 2019,negative,a slap in the face for marvel fans
Mar 17 2019,negative,besides all that unnecessary pseudofeminism referencedoesnt affect that much the movie had a lack of interesting elements is dull as fck starts really good the actress was really good choice and has a good performance but then story turns boring too sentimental that kills that plot besides that what kills the movies is the disrespectful bullh1t about changing an iconic and powerful character like walter lawson marvell with a senseless and dull character o minerva role change  breaks my heart crappy shadowed and powerless enemys makes captain marvel overpowered
Mar 17 2019,positive,long time marvel fan i saw this on opening saturday in a full theater that had quite a few kids i really enjoyed the film was happy to see that the negative hype was overstated this is not the new last jedi thank goodness solid entry into the franchise i did have negative feeling for brie but she won me over worth seeing in the theater
Mar 17 2019,positive,while itï 12tms neither the most thrilling nor the most original installment in the marvel cinematic universe captain marvel is a nearflawless prequel guaranteed to enthrall the casual fan     academy award winner brie larson stars as vers an elite warrior of star command whose past is a mystery even to herself vers is a human in the midst of kree an alien species on the planet of hala she has no memory of her life before the kree discovered her and she is endowed with extraordinary powers with no knowledge of where they came from the kree war with the shapeshifting skrulls leads vers to earth where she meets shield agent nick fury samuel l jackson and rediscovers her human past    larson fits seamlessly into the mcu having instant chemistry with everyone she interacts with her relationship with fury makes for one of the best duos in the saga only upstaged by furyï 12tms relationship with goose the seemingly normal earthling cat who is actually a dangerous alien jackson gives fury his best performance since winter soldier and the film is as much about him as it is about the titular captain    phil coulson clark gregg is severely underutilized in the film and is unfortunately relegated to an easteregg teaser of a performance coulson is a staple of the mcu and deserves better goose is another character who will leave you wanting more the flerken feline is the most lovable nonverbal minor character ive ever seen outside of star wars droids r2d2 and bb8    the film suffers eversoslightly from the pacing problems of thor but not nearly to that degree there are dull moments in the middle of the film with most of the action coming as bookends the humor is distributed evenly throughout however and the 90s nostalgia is utilized perfectly as always marvel excels in visual effects and cinematography and the score is solid if unremarkable     captain marvel is by no means a groundbreaking contribution to the genre and wonï 12tmt measure up to modern classics like iron man winter soldier or infinity war but itï 12tms a fun ride comparable to antman and guardians of the galaxy    itï 12tms worth noting that marvel is currently suffering from the same antifeminist review sabotage that plagued the last jedi though the couch critics wonï 12tmt admit it they disguise themselves as comicbook purists while ignoring that very little of their beloved mcu is true to its source material they began criticizing larsonï 12tms acting based on the trailer alone and ignore the fact that sheï 12tms a golden globe and academy award winning star    anna boden and ryan fleckï 12tms superhero debut has held the no 1 spot in the box office for two weeks running and set the record for largest global debut for a womanfronted film at press time the filmï 12tms worldwide gross is sitting at 7602 million making it the highestgrossing film of 2019 and the eleventhhighest grossing film of the mcu     captain marvel will have the quickest noncameo return to the screen of any marvel star to date when she joins the avengerï 12tms ensemble in endgame on april 26 2019 as always donï 12tmt forget to stick around for both mid and postcredit scenes    how does it stack up   scottï 12tms topten mcu rankings  captain america the winter soldier 2014  the avengers 2012  thor ragnarok 2017  iron man 2008  captain america civil war 2016  guardians of galaxy vol 2 2017  avengers infinity war 2018  captain marvel 2019  black panther 2018  captain america the first avenger 2011
Mar 17 2019,neutral,610 road to end game nothing special
Mar 17 2019,positive,i saw this movie and we loved it brie larson was very good as captain marvel  samual l jacksom was great as always  a good plot that tied many things together  cant wait to see her in avengers end game much of it takes place on earth but the outerspace effects are topnotch  evveyone will love the cat gooseanother great outing from the mcui suspect the negative reviews from fansto be fake  its a must see for marvel fans
Mar 17 2019,positive,great movie only gets better with each viewing once your in on the story you appreciate it much more    a much deserved addition to the mcu
Mar 17 2019,positive,perfectly fine marvel movie the cgi was good and the story as well there some some comedic queues that were missed by brie larson as well as emotion in needed scenes overall a movie that will keep you entertained till endgame
Mar 17 2019,positive,doesnt quite soar to the high standards of other films in the mcu impressive stable however holds up well in its own right as an origin film an impressive cast all do their jobs with fun although some attempts of humor fall a tad flat a great soundtrack and score add to the cool 90s vibe
Mar 17 2019,positive,one of the best movies of the year
Mar 17 2019,neutral,marvel has done a lot better but still better than any dc film by far i actually enjoyed her acting and the plot wasnt bad my only issue was how there was no moment of real danger in the end she solves everything with very little effort required and you can tell the movie was made more for endgame than trying to be a good solo movie
Mar 17 2019,positive,great movie funny entertaining full of easter eggs family loved it
Mar 17 2019,neutral,underwhelming for a marvel movie but ok ignore the 5 stars and the 12 stars suffers from lack of jeopardy to danvers she is totally unbeatable nothing puts you on the edge of your seat
Mar 17 2019,positive,one of the better marvel mcu movie
Mar 17 2019,neutral,average the cast are likable but the story lacks suspense there was no point during the movie where i felt concerned carol wasnt going to easily defeat the bad guys the story picks up once amnesiac carol gets her memories back and meets up with monica rambeau until then the only real saving grace of the movie is the action
Mar 17 2019,positive,loved it was great to see such a strong woman and it was funny too
Mar 17 2019,positive,i went to see this movie with no expectations i found myself tearing up a few times the audience was filled with little girls sitting on the edge of their seats i think this film has some really important messages for young women and people in general discover who you truly are dont blindly follow authority without knowing the facts and human beings regardless of their differences are still human beings very inspiring 
Mar 17 2019,negative,bad movie 2 hours of no character building and just crying over being put down nothing memeroble about it wonder woman did it better
Mar 17 2019,negative,worst marvel movie pace weird messed up continuity fight scene unimpressive last battle straight forward unbelievable
Mar 17 2019,negative,just so awful enough said
Mar 17 2019,positive,not sure what all the bashing of the movie was about it was a lot fun to watch  i enjoyed it and canâtmt wait to see it again
Mar 17 2019,negative,totally horrible i dont even understand how movies like this even get to the box office no character development horrible acting unbelievable that people could possibly give this movie five stars
Mar 17 2019,positive,this movie was thrilling fun and humorous  as a lover of the 90s seattlealternative rock scenepearl jam soundgarden etci thoroughly enjoyed the musical aspects of the film the score was not my favorite marvel score but the mix of alternative rock and scifi electronica fit well with the 90s theme  captain marvel does have a few scenes that may not make sense to a nonmarvel fan but overall it can stand alone unlike infinity war or civil warwhich require viewers to see the previous films in their respective series   the acting in the film was good not great as there were a few cringeworthy emotional scenes ie hugging scene between carol danvers and maria rambeau but samuel jackson and ben mendelsohn took home the cake with their mix of comedic relief and emotional scenes  the movie was visually stunning and overall beautiful to watch especially on hala the kree home planet also watching carol and nick fury ride through 90s united states was incredibly fun to watchseeing background easter eggs was especially rewarding  but the most beautiful moment of the film came right at the beginning with the amazing stan lee tribute i hadnt read about the film at all before the movie for fear of spoilers and this was the biggest surprise of all for me you never expect the most touching moment of a film to come at the very beginning but this is exactly what happened and this is why this film will forever be immortalizedfor immortalizing stan lee forever  all in all this film is original nostalgic and visually beautiful
Mar 17 2019,positive,this movie was amazing
Mar 17 2019,negative,well it isnt ah bad moviejust a boring one its ah good made marvel movieas always but it lacks of really nice aktion and storythe main character is extremely weak in my eyes go watch it and make youre own decision if its good or bad
Mar 17 2019,positive,captain marvel was great loved the retro 90s settings young nick fury was awesome
Mar 17 2019,positive,i liked it  i went in with low expectations because of all the controversy surrounding this movie  it wasnt perfect but it was far better than id heard  im a guy who likes everything though so ya know take this with a grain of salt  now to the minor spoilers parts that worked 90s nastalgia fury  danvers relationship the plot wasnt disjointed id heard it was but also it wasnt linear on purpose larsons actings been poopood on but i thought she did great  all the other stuff outside of the movie was distracting but the movie itself was great ive seen it twice once in 2d and once in 3d ill probably see it again  there were things i didnt like  skrulls are not good guys  the cat  the cat scratching the face  several people willynilly touched  held the spoiler  teseract sp
Mar 17 2019,positive,this was the female superhero movie i have been waiting for lots of action no ridiculous skimpy costumes and no silly love interest to make her more âlikableâ    sheâtms badass enough all on her own and brie larson made sure we knew that samuel l jackson was awesome as ever     and now i want a flerken seems easier than trying to mariekondo my home
Mar 17 2019,positive,i liken this movie the most to captain america the first avenger it has a similar story arc if not a story line if you are a marvel movie fan then this is a must see however as a stand alone movie it will depend on your personal taste if super hero movies are not your thing then definitely skip this one as it is well centered in the super hero genre the current 62 audience score seems to be downward weighted perhaps by internet trolls the tomato meter is a better indicator as i think the movie could be justifiably as low as 73 but not higher than 88
Mar 17 2019,positive,best marvel standalone movie to date you cant change my mind
Mar 17 2019,positive,it was a fun movie yes a few things could have been better but it was a fun 90s ride
Mar 17 2019,negative,not the worst superhero flick but rather unoriginal with a lot of forced humour not as funny as ragnarock not as action packed as avengers not as great a soundtrack as guardians you get the drift
Mar 17 2019,positive,absolutely stunning the cgi was incredible and the group of girls i went to see the film with said i understand why men feel empowered all the time with a hero like that i feel empowered
Mar 17 2019,positive,i thought the movie was entertaining and enjoyable but didnt love it quite as thoroughly as that of my 14 yearold daughter it had a fairly good balance of drama humour and action with a great 90s soundtrack i loved annette benning samuel l jackson and jude law but brie larson appeared illmatched among these seasoned actors and she has yet to be among the powerhouse actors that make up the avengers it was worth a watch but  not one in the series that i would want to watch again and again
Mar 17 2019,negative,very disappointed  bad story film shot too dark and pointless fight scenes acting sucked toi
Mar 17 2019,negative,didnt like how the final battle was way to much cgi and looked like a video game personaly i feel like it was the worst mcu movie to date movie seem more for like little kids than older audiances also couldnt place my finger on if i didnt not like the character carol danvers or how bree lawrcen portrayed the character she seemed like a small child with anger management problems and entitled even worse that peter quill one pet peve wat they made her way to opover powered it feels almost like super man levels of op  to were the conflict should be solved from the very begining and shouldnt be draged out my hopes are the russo brother somehow find a way to ground the character a bit more or eles end game is going to be capatin marvel showing up beating up thanos and well that pretty much it
Mar 17 2019,positive,loved the movie  one of the best marvel superhero movies so far
Mar 17 2019,positive,the movie doesnt know what its trying to be and brie larsons acting leaves something left to be desired samuel l jackson is one of the few redeeming qualities in this movie
Mar 17 2019,positive,not as bad as haters want and not as a revolutionary as lovers want pretty entertaining movie
Mar 17 2019,negative,i heard this was an average mcu movie so i went in with low expectations    unfortunately the movie still managed to disappoint  first 30 minutes were averagetogood but middle 45 minutes of movie were very boring like a bottom 10 star trek episode climax had lots of fighting and explosions but the newly minted heroin was just op not very interesting combat strategy etc just go destroy everything wno resistance possible    i hope this is the lowest mcu will go
Mar 17 2019,positive,brie larson total badass must see
Mar 17 2019,positive,the film lacks the famous âmarvel flareâ but makes up for it with very loveable characters and multiple twists for both comic fans and moviegoers to enjoy
Mar 17 2019,positive,its okay if you have time and are bored    is the movie super awful no  is it super great no    i only watched it for â799
Mar 17 2019,negative,forgettable no character arc just a railroad to rewrite marvel
Mar 17 2019,negative,first unnecessarily contrived marvel movie the tesseract seems totaly forced and took me completely out of the film nick fury and agen coulsons backstories are completely mundane and wasted especially when it comes to furys eye hard pass
Mar 17 2019,positive,predictably underrated but dont be fooled interesting plot and exemplary climax its complexity is greater than many marvel films perhaps not on the level of black panther and civil war which i would give 55 stars if it was allowed
Mar 17 2019,negative,this movie is flat out bad
Mar 17 2019,positive,loves this movie the most integrering addition to the mcu since many many years and brie larson does the role perfectly hope to see many more movies with her as captain marvel
Mar 17 2019,negative,an alarming drop in quality from previous marvel films released in the past few years
Mar 17 2019,negative,okay i suppose but it answers a lot of questions that no one was asking and not in a satisfying way brie larsen not very charismatic and the characterï 12tms supanman level power was not explained well enough doesnï 12tmt add to the mcu if anything it tarnished past storylines
Mar 17 2019,positive,nonstop awesomeness  brie larson is brilliant in this role  great entertainment
Mar 17 2019,negative,third time i have tried to rate this movie and my rating is not accepted    short rating   2dimensional actress leading 2dimensional movie into what i hope is a lead in to the 4dimension    longer  i dont get the hype on brie larsen  she was 2dimendional in room and i feel she was only nominated because the movie could have been so strong      but the only there who carried the movie was jacob tremblay    not surprising that brie larsen did her best in cm and still could not get beyond the 2dimension of a comic book  actually cant even give that much credit
Mar 17 2019,positive,an excellent movie with killer actions scenes lady power and samuel l jackson
Mar 17 2019,negative,bland acting and poor performance by our new lead only good part was the cat
Mar 17 2019,negative,wasnt great but not terrible either  only recommend to people that watch every marvel movie anyway to stay in the loop to the overall story
Mar 17 2019,positive,610  it was an entertaining movie with a good plot poorly executed it felt like they tried to make a classic action movie but with meh action and tried to get us to like it purely with nostalgia     movie would have been much better if they didnt get political and focused on the story rather than their political agenda that blatantly come through
Mar 17 2019,positive,i watched it its a awesome movie definitely would reccomend it to family friends
Mar 17 2019,negative,i know marvel studios takes liberties but deciding to make the skrull refugees went too far cinematics and action was well paced but this decision ruins mcu potential
Mar 17 2019,negative,it was good not great
Mar 17 2019,neutral,marvels latest release captain marvel was okay i have certainly seen much better movies but i have also seen much worse movies aside from all the personal controversy brie larson is a talented actress her play of the titular character is likable and her chemistry with costar samuel l jackson is enjoyable unfortunately i would have appreciated an effort to make the plot and story develop a love for the character and her growth instead of rewriting the origin story marvel should have focused those writers on plugging some of the rather large incredibly convenient holes in the plot what was delivered however was a superhero that miraculously becomes the biggest badass in the galaxy with nothing gained and nothing lost while i believe that watching any comic adaptation forces you to willingly enter a suspension of disbelief this particular movie still left too many questions of how why and just a resounding huh do i recommend watching this movie yes it is part of the marvel cinematic universe and is worth the 2 hour runtime investment would i watch it again no once is enough and there is no need in my life to ever see it again would i recommend paying to see it in the theater that would be completely up to the consumer but i do not feel that it was worth the cost of the ticket i was underwhelmed by it on the big screen so i am sure i would have been just as content watching it at home my hope is that in future installments marvel works less at manipulating people into the theaters and more at manipulating audiences to feel something positive for the characters on the screen
Mar 17 2019,positive,larson is no gal gadot she could be replaced by any other number of more competent actresses for avengers endgame and i wouldnt miss her really this movie was all about stitching things together and preparing the mcu audience for endgame  the cat wasnt that damn funny  still it didnt suck and i was entertained
Mar 17 2019,positive,good origin story but it definitely feels like a phase 1 movie brie larson did an amazing job
Mar 17 2019,positive,with a more concise story could of been a better film but a good warm up to endgame
Mar 17 2019,negative,it was the first set of spiderman movies for me  the acting was soso and samuel l jackson upstages and outshines everyone but the cat  i was genuinely excited from the trailers but left disappointed  the animated cartoon was more faithful to the secret wars than this
Mar 17 2019,negative,just another cliche character backstory
Mar 17 2019,positive,incredible movie itâtms 2019 it was time for a female led marvel movie absolutely empowering truly a movie for the millenia my children will one day sit down and thank bre larson for her astonishing performance in captain marvel
Mar 17 2019,negative,it was disappointing
Mar 17 2019,positive,higher further faster indeed
Mar 17 2019,positive,great addition to the marvel universe  funny touching inspiring  loved every minute
Mar 17 2019,positive,it not a bad movie but story doesnt feel it fits the marvel cu
Mar 17 2019,positive,opening stan thing was dope very classy in my opinion the logo sequence is what im referring to first impression is that i like the way its shot lets get to the characters first act boring trash too much exposition and bad acting writing is horrible im wanting to leave sam jackson and colson look great i see where the money went finally the train scene grabs me and i settle in loved the kevin smith shoutout second act love the best friend stuff finally larson is showing me something im actually believing her for the first time too bad it doesnt last long she goes back to being a tv movie actress the fight scenes rule but are shot too close i cant tell whats going on until i get a medium shot too many close ups its cool that her powers come from the a stone shows why shes so powerful and i buy it goose steals the movie final act saw the twist coming a mile away ben mendelson is a great actor jude law is just being himself writing is still dumb im having fun larson is still bad at acting but she does get to show some skill with her physical acting helps a lot i forgot about her friends daughter she rules better actress than larson in this anyway bing bang boom explosions and larson is flying and shes really dope i like this part a lot writing still bad fury lost his eye to goose i like that its a dumb reason like the ending with the pager overall its fine maybe top ten for the mcu for me toward the bottom though 
Mar 17 2019,negative,captain marvel feels like a supporting player not a featured attraction
Mar 17 2019,neutral,before i add my comments about the movie lets review how we got to capt marvel in the first place  the mcu braintrust had just put the final touches on the ultimate villain  one who could fairly easily defeat earths greatest superheros turning half of the population of the universe including a large chunk of earths mightiest heroes into dust  so when your ateam is soundly beaten and devastated what do you next  well as any 12 year old comic book fan can tell you call on superman  there is only one tiny little problem with the obvious answer  superman isnt part of the mcu and the  odds of dc comics allowing superman in a marvel movie are uh not very good  therefore it becomes necessary to create a supermanlike hero that wont create a massive lawsuit and ruin the multibillion dollar payday that everyone is greatly anticipating while still providing enough firepower to take down the bad guy  thus we end up with capt marvel an upthesleeve aceinthehole with the right combination of superpowers to enter late in the game and still take down the ultimate bad guy  and that in my opinion is the problem with capt marvel  it doesnt matter if capt marvel is male female alien animal or intelligent vegetable  introducing the most powerful superhero of all  during the second act is a cowardly dishonest way out  capt marvel is simply not needed to finish the avengers story line and feels like cheating  either solve the problem with the superheros that are left or introduce capt marvel before the story line begins  my primary reason to see capt marvel was that i was afraid i would miss a key part of endgame if i skipped it  after seeing the movie there doesnt seem to be anything critical to endgame in capt marvel but who knows what may show up in the final episode  capt marvel is an okay movie but not a great one  the character is soso but were definitely not talking tony stark or star lord or even steve rogers here  if capt marvel is going to be the ultimate superhero and introduced this late in the game at least create a compelling character that grabs your attention and make you want to cheer for them  im not sure if another actor could have elevated capt marvel to the level of the  best mcu characters but the one we got didnt  thus we end up with an okay movie that fits somewhere in the middle to back of the pack of the mcu superhero movies
Mar 17 2019,positive,great addition to another to the mcu if you like marvel you should love this movie
Mar 17 2019,negative,when i first heard that brie larson would be starring as the powerful super hero captain marvel i was excited i had enjoyed her past works such as free fire kong skull island and the glass castle each of these left me with positive outlooks on the films and in everyone larson was a key contributor so when the first trailer for the film was released i was excited it seemed like a thoroughly exciting film and i had high hopes establishing a clear villain a hint to where the story would go and an all around phenomenal cast to accompany her unfortunately you cant judge a book by its cover and i learnt that the same rule applies for movies as well the weekend the movie was released i already started hearing negative comments and such about the movie like empty theaters and negative reviews such reviews coming from friends sisters and other such family despite this i went into the movie with an open mind ready to enjoy another outstanding marvel flick and that isnt what i received as the movie rolled i started to become confused and slightly bored the film didnt seem to know what direction it wanted to go in almost like it had numerous amounts of people disagreeing on where they wanted the film to go the action was sparse and out of place and none of enemies posed any threat to the films main protagonists most of them feeling like stand ins and feeling kinda comedic relief  one second the skrulls are placed in to be universally threatening and the next the buddy buddy showing at the front door claiming to be the good guys the movie seemed to have no flow no emotional impact in the film the head skrull is shot in front of his family in a deadly way and the same event is immediately forgotten minutes later with no true impact on the film no dire mission to save him nothing it was just there to attempt an emotional connection when there was none to begin with the entire film was taught to hate the skrulls and the next im expected to feel pity for them i found it quite funny the ending battle is shot horrifically in a dark room with a variety of enemies that ive not seem since the first twenty minutes of the film and now all of a sudden have to root against when they seemed like solidly good people in the beginning of the film not wanting to hurt locals and being self conscious to not disturb the peace then now there out to take over the universe because they wanted a motor thatll make them go fast larson was a dull actor with little character and the other actors were the redeeming factor of the film they should recast her and rescrap her
Mar 17 2019,positive,amazing a wonder addition to an already incredible cinematic universe
Mar 17 2019,negative,captain marvel was very bland and formulaic it felt like iâtmve seen this a hundred times and different plot points kind of messed up the continuity of the mcu also brie larson litterally only showed two emotions throughout the entire movie while itâtms not the worst mcu movie itâtms far from being good it did not live up to the hype
Mar 17 2019,negative,i gave this film one star in consideration of the previous movies of the mcu as a standalone film it would be around 2 stars    that said i liked every previous mcu moviearound 20 they were weaker ones like thor 2 or even the hulk but this movie did not even feel like a real mcu movie
Mar 17 2019,positive,not sure what people were expecting but this movie lives up to my expectation  humor action and unique storyline  were there slow parts sure but it was not a boring movie at all  its one i will see again and again
Mar 17 2019,positive,great movie compelling story great visual effects and very good acting
Mar 17 2019,negative,worst cgi since hulk basically no character development massive plot holes on the mcu universe
Mar 17 2019,positive,an enjoyable watch with a nice plot twist but nothing special to make it memorable
Mar 17 2019,neutral,wasnt bad but wasnt good really forgettable
Mar 17 2019,positive,it was a good movie brie larsen was great as captain marvel i will go see captain marvel 2 easily
Mar 17 2019,positive,endearing protagonists villains that you love to hate emotion comedy buttkicking action  wellworth the money and time spent watching it in the theater  equally on par with the entertainment value of every other brilliantlydirected marvel movie and a hat tip to every woman and girl who has ever been told that she is too emotional to be powerful
Mar 17 2019,negative,continuity problems with other mcu movies major plot holes overarching forced agenda that just makes the movie a total flop  i was very disappointed and im concerned about what this has done to endgame
Mar 17 2019,negative,lowest of recent mcu releases at no time do you believe sheâtms captain of anything weak storyline cgi and to think judd law is suppose to be some kind of yoda was unrealistic
Mar 17 2019,negative,this is a lame character  the story line is lame  as an air force member this whole thing is lame
Mar 17 2019,negative,bad acting story line ending with the bad guy getting a chance was bad scene a a turn off bad aliens becoming friends with the change in story not credible high school writing play
Mar 17 2019,positive,absolutely amazing the whole movie theater giving a standing ovation after both the opening scene with stan lee and after the movie had ended it was a light hearted twist for in between iw and endgame and was so amazingly uplifting for women and correct on so many levels on what women go through
Mar 17 2019,positive,it was really fun and funny but didnâtmt come across as just for laughs the actors were well cast and seemed natural real and likable it was just a really good movie yes i do think it all tied up a little too easily and neatly but overall it well worth it
Mar 17 2019,negative,worst marvel comic movie
Mar 17 2019,negative,disappointing the movies characters didnt seem to have any sort of chemistry with each other it was like each one was acting by themselves
Mar 17 2019,positive,great hero introduction for captain marvel brie larson brings the charismatic hero to life in yet another well done marvel film
Mar 17 2019,positive,great movie but i feel like she was invincible through the whole movie she didnt seem like the underdog like the other movies in the mcu
Mar 17 2019,positive,absolutely loved it
Mar 17 2019,negative,so disappointed in this movie brie larsen was the worst mcu marvel character to date they need to recast or kill off this character i even watched this movie twice to make sure on how i felt no heart or soul in this movie and brie comes across as very entitled and there is no real payoff here as a longtime marvel fan this movie has put a bad taste in my mouth
Mar 17 2019,negative,worst mcu release to date ghostbusters 2016 was more entertaining and it was trash  dont watch this even for free  not required viewing for avengers endgame at all
Mar 17 2019,negative,shockingly bad for a disneymarvel movie poor direction and screenplay humor all fell flat annette benning was poorly cast and turned in a really weak performance does anyone believe a 75 yearold woman would be flying fighter jets i am beyond shocked no one at disney failed to see the train wreck that is this movie even the cgi to make nick fury and olson look younger made them look cartoonish 
Mar 17 2019,negative,worst superhero movie ive ever seen makes the green lantern look great
Mar 17 2019,positive,it kept me in gagged the only thing is yes there are some political things in this movie but it kept me in gagged and like all the other marvel movies it was awesome
Mar 17 2019,positive,pleasently suprised good movie
Mar 17 2019,negative,story it self is not upto the mark and it felt like brie did nthng to deserve those god like powers der was nothing at stake cldnt really relate with the emotions no vulnerbility it was just bland samuel l jackson and goose the cat saved the movie and man best friend of brie  dnt realy remm her name  she did way better than brie acting wise i just dont think brie is for action movies the personality dnt do justice to captain marvels character otherwise great vfx and amazing post credit scene rest okay oky
Mar 17 2019,positive,i really enjoyed the movie  it was entertaining and never seemed to drag  im really disappointed in all the feminist allegories people complained about  i go to a movie and not try to pull any special political or social meaning from it unless it slaps me in the face  when and if it does i stop watching  nothing jumped out at me here other than it being a good movie and carol danvers being a bad ass hero
Mar 17 2019,positive,superb looking forward to the end game
Mar 17 2019,positive,easily one of the top movies in the mcu well written acted very fun love the soundtrack
Mar 17 2019,neutral,a very run of the mill film contrary to what those who are hyping this film up are saying the reviews saying it is mediocre are in fact the real reviews as others have stated bries acting is very wooden fury and goose are the most interesting parts of the film it does have some good action scenes but for the most part there is no peril for this character that allows you to get behind her a main point of this film is supposed to be how carol has been oppressed by various people throughout her earth life and her kree life we see in memories how people kept telling her she couldnt do things in the early memories we see this causing her to fall which is supposed to make us feel for her character but in the later longer versions of those memories we see that the real reason she falls is her own fault ie in the usaf she is teased for being stuck at the top of a rope and her reaction is to try to show them by swinging to the next rope leaping into a double back flip in the process and unsurprisingly failing to land it and falling to the floor in another whilst in a go kart she is teased for going too slow and promptly floors the accelerator the result being that she is going far faster than she can handle and of course she crashes im sorry but this creates no sympathy for her and smashes any narrative they are trying to push as for the kree  holding her back i have to say that what they do actually makes perfect sense when it comes to restricting her powers they encounter a being who has absorbed and unknown energy and as a result has developed super powers powers that are accessed through emotion this being it can be assumed rather safely i might add has virtually zero control over their emotions and having no idea how powerful they might be the kree fit them with an inhibitor bearing in mind when we first meet carolvers it has been 6 years since she got her powers that she has been in combat and emotional control training for the entire time despite this it is made clear that she loses control over the slightest frustration and it is no wonder the kree do not feel willing to free her from those restrictions just yet her mentor jude law is supposed to be seen as another vile person who is holding her back yet to anyone who can see past the shallow ideology presented it is obvious that he is in fact trying to help her to learn how to control her emotions with the goal being that they will finally remove the inhibitor the fact that he points out that if she were able to control her emotions she wouldnt need to be restricted in her use of her powers merely confirms this there are some good buddy cop humour scenes between carol and fury but these are few and i feel the film would have benefited from more of these moments we see a young nick fury who is new to the whole aliens are real thing but we can see the beginnings of the fury we know and love plus his scenes with goose are entertaining especially when he learns what goose really is the end credit scenes are the only part of this film that tie in to endgame so if thats all youre interested in id recommend looking them up on google as theres not much else in this film for you on the whole its ok but nowhere near amazing or the best movie ever or whatever else the hypers are claiming it is a bog standard origin movie that is made forgettable as our hero is never truly in any danger and there is no epic final battle just a rather laughable scene where she is challenged to a fair fight and she declines this in an im not taking orders from you moment that just compounds the view that she is an arrogant self opinionated and wholly unrelatable character best score i can give is 510 definitely not worth the hype one to keep for a rainy day or if theres nothing else on at the cinema
Mar 17 2019,positive,great acting and storyline  wonderful to see a strong yet personable female hero very current with the issues in the world around immigration  should be rated higher
Mar 17 2019,negative,wonderwoman raised the bar captain marvel dashed it a very classic example of overhyped marketing and subpar delivery    so marvellousy
Mar 17 2019,positive,nice entry to the mcu but not going down as one of the best  brie larson is okay as captain marvel  samuel l jackson is good as usual  i really liked ben mendelsohn as talos  any fan of the mcu obviously needs to watch this movie to get ready for end game  i did like it all of the 90s references and overall it was a fun movie
Mar 17 2019,positive,a really good movie in my personal opinion i still prefer some marvel movies over ittherefore i decided not to give it 5 stars
Mar 17 2019,negative,more like a disney movie rather than a marvel movie  it should be call young fury and goose
Mar 17 2019,negative,i didnâtmt like how they seemed to make everything worse in this film when fury said âthe last time i trusted someone i lost an eyeâ and it ends up being the cat how lame they also made marvel a woman not cool stay true to the comic people please jude law wouldâtmve been perfect for that role
Mar 17 2019,negative,the movie was just your normal cookie cutter marvels origin story   brie larson did an ok job but the biggest disappointment was how nick fury  lost his eye  it was bs and for that i award you no points
Mar 17 2019,positive,its a good movie to watch
Mar 17 2019,positive,great movie not the best marvel film ever made but still loved it
Mar 17 2019,positive,the movie was in the middle of the road when it comes to the mcu nick fury talos jude law and goose saved this movie for me carol danvers was hardly likeable and the story wasnâtmt great nor was it terrible i definitely recommend watching this if you are a fan of all the marvel movies
Mar 17 2019,neutral,pretty slow paced and boring at times
Mar 17 2019,positive,ehhh worse marvel movie yet still not horrible though not a huge fan of brie larson but could have been worse
Mar 17 2019,negative,this movie is bad really bad itâtms boring and disrespectful to the source material brie larson is the most boring superhero i have ever seen
Mar 17 2019,positive,amazing movie with a great backstory and even greater soundtrack
Mar 17 2019,positive,this was a fun entertaining marvel movie a great origin story with lots of amazing special effects action and humor lots of tieinâtms with avengers and a few easter eggs loved it
Mar 17 2019,negative,alita was a much better movie this movie felt so forced
Mar 17 2019,positive,first of all im not a comic book kinda guy never was probably wont ever be im perfectly fine watching the culmination of all that creativity filter its way onto the the silver screen in time  to start off i left the theater pretty happy with the movie  it looked good it felt good the music was top notch the action was thrilling and the plot was good  going in i figured this would end up being a men suck and girls are the true heroes kind of movie but not to my logical surprise i didnt think that was what this movie was about at all  it simply was a story of how a regular person became a super hero and realized that they had special powers and in the advent of those powers they would need to now step up to the challenge of righting wrongs and standing up for those who are in need  if that sounds like the makings of a typical and good hero movie then thats what i felt this movie represented when i left the theater this was an actionfantasy movie that was fun to watch  bottom line im a fan of captain marvel as a movie not so much as a superhero mainly because she seems as far as i can tell not reading the comics as though she has no weaknesses im wondering if any bad guy in the galaxy can even give her a run for her money please note that is not due to the movie adaptation its who the character is in the comics  so aside from thati though it was great fun
Mar 17 2019,negative,worst actress performance in any marvel movie ever cringy dialogues not the fun kind and bad action scenes
Mar 17 2019,positive,great movie was very impressed
Mar 17 2019,positive,great movie with great acting and chemistry    captain marvel is a strong new character for the mcu
Mar 17 2019,negative,a disappointing movie  struggles with inconsistency in tone and pacing and a boring story
Mar 17 2019,positive,best part of the movie for me had to be the skrull twist my favorite character was easily ben menlelsohnâtms portrayal of talos talos made the movie complicated and emotional i love movies that show a two sided story for the characters in it not like the classical âgood vs evilâ movies that many dc fans are used too marvel shows that not every â bad guy â is necessarily a purely evil person the antagonists donâtmt think of themselves as evil they have motive and ambitions and they think they are usually doing what is best like thanos in infinity war also to be noted i think goose was probably the funniest part of the movie that mother flerken gave the movie that classic âmarvel comedyâ that everyone loves without these two characters captain marvel i think would have have kinda shallow non humorous and kinda cheesy brie larson could have done a  better job portraying carol danvers but she definitely tried carol danvers is a marvel character that i donâtmt think translates to film well so pretty much i think this was a very âmiddle of the roadâ film by marveldisney  it definitely was not as good as it was hyped up to be but it was still enjoyable to watch for the most part also i have no idea how people are saying that carol danvers is the â most powerfulâ of the avengers  i definitely donâtmt think that thor or even the hulk would have any issues  taking so long to defeat yonrogg or the other star force members
Mar 17 2019,negative,waste of time and money
Mar 17 2019,positive,as an origin movie it was equally if not better then most of marvel origin movies its not avengers entertaining but still very good
Mar 17 2019,negative,bad movie not on par with the other mcu movies and can clearly make out that the movie was made with an agenda why all this feministic approach to movie making remove gender out of it and focus on making a good movie brie larson is not superhero material dont like her acting
Mar 17 2019,negative,i went into the movie house really wanting and hoping this would be goodit is a marvel film after all sadly it just want  i personally dont know of capt marvels origin story but i felt so disconnected to the character and never felt invested in her even by the end of the moviei dont  evwn see how she factors into the endgame story which was fine as it was  honestly they shouldve made an adam warlock story instead
Mar 17 2019,negative, an enormous step backwards for marvel feels like a rushed phase one movie hope avengers end game wont be as disappointing dont get me wrong it wasnt extremely bad it was more like captain america the first avenger week from todays perspective rather than ca the winter soldier which was amazing i realy hope that marvel will redeem itself with captain marvel ii just like they did with winter soldier
Mar 17 2019,positive,people need to relax  have fun  and enjoy the film it was pretty solid and they did a great job with the origin 
Mar 17 2019,negative,average movie with bland acting from larson the character doesnt seem to grow at all through the film essentially once the chip in her neck is removed she can just do anything there was no real threat in this film neither me or the women i watched with enjoyed her acting and the boring character of captain marvel it should be noted there are some funny moments in the film and the cg is good if not too much as is normal with marvel films all in all this movie is simply riding the wave of all previous marvel films
Mar 17 2019,positive,higher farther faster    my husband and i love this movie so much we saw it twice on the same day   while there has been some criticism  in regard to the first half of the movie being too busy i think the directors and the riders did an excellent job  streamlining 50 years of history with this character into an imaginative compelling human and enjoyable movie this is very much in keeping with the excellent storytelling of richard donners  superman of which the script  brilliantly adapted and retooled by the late great tom mankiewicz is a similar homage to the character while also interjecting modern practices of the time and great humor quite like a screwball comedy in moments captain marvel achieves this and more  it emancipates female superheroes and opens up script writing for women where we can stand alone and go on our own journey without being the function of a man two its male bro detractors i can only write this women are why you are here    get over it
Mar 17 2019,negative,nothing kills her she can fly through rockets and into space there are no real stakes you have no concern the character will actually die     forced relationships they bring in a âfriendâ midway through and expect you to care    i came in with low expectations to begin with but the worst thing and the thing i was surprised by was the dry humor that didnâtmt stick and weird flask backs it wasnâtmt fun
Mar 17 2019,negative,solid mehh came off kind of stiff compared to some of the fun the mcu is use to having
Mar 17 2019,positive,an above average movie with a couple of startlingly bad scenes  the top gun homage is short but its so bad it mars a huge portion of the movie  when marvel learns to fly she suddenly has a horrendous looking mohawk helmet on her head and the whole scene is lousy  plus the special effects for that one scene suddenly became subpar and the overall sequence is outright cheesy  it shouldnt stop people from going because they dont completely ruin the movie but they are a couple nasty warts on an otherwise better than average movie
Mar 17 2019,positive,absolutely amazing film ignore the trailers which donâtmt do the film any justice at all fills in a lot of the mcuâtms history in really fun ways and builds even more hype for avengers endgame
Mar 17 2019,positive,okay so we went into the movie thinking that it would be disappointing because of the reviews that we had seen and the rotten tomatoes score which for marvel comic movies is subpar   this movie was excellent i loved the introduction of the characters i loved the plot twist and turns i was very pleased with understanding how fury and captain marvel establishe their bond i give the film 910
Mar 17 2019,neutral,overall the movie lacked depth and background in many areas the strongest hero in the marvel universal receive her power in a very dull and uneventful way
Mar 17 2019,negative,there is no substance to this movie its completely forgettable the title character has no character arch no real bearers to overcome wonder woman did a great job portraying a strong female lead who was strong on her own merit while captain marvel felt like i was being told she is a strong woman and expected to simply believe it
Mar 17 2019,positive,great origin story  didnt know anything about captain marvel  laughed aloud half a dozen times  fun music great sci fi action built great comaraderie between characters  great retro memories  saw it twice
Mar 17 2019,negative,just a bad movie with major plot holes this movie is not the worse marvel movie but it might be the second worse
Mar 17 2019,negative,the worst mcu movie ever
Mar 17 2019,positive,certainly not the best marvel movie to date but it was far from terrible despite what so many have claimed i feel like too many took issue with brie larson early on and it completely tainted any possibility of objectivity    go see it for yourself and just enjoy the movie
Mar 17 2019,positive,loved this movie one of the best marvel movies this was an amazing job and the fact that the best super hero is a woman the back story and leading up to the final reveal was amazing this is a must see marvel movie it was spectacular
Mar 17 2019,positive,it was pretty good  however there was a lot of shoehorning going on  it was an unfortunate decision to introduce the main character in one film as there was enough meat to give the character plenty of story  but i guess we will have to wait for disney to grow up a bit more when it comes to felame lead superhero movies
Mar 17 2019,positive,if not familiar with comic book background  the beginning flashbacks that build  captain marvels story can be confusing  however it all makes sense in the climactic scenes at the end  cant wait to see it again and how she fits into  the marvel universe
Mar 17 2019,positive,mind blowingly awesome
Mar 17 2019,negative,captain meh no need to see this for endgame boring movie boring lead and even  boring nick fury only positive was the de aging of sam jackson had it in the bottom 3rd of the mcu but after a few days its the worst marvel movie
Mar 17 2019,positive,this happened to be my first movie in 3dimax and it was a visual treat just the special effects itself makes it a must watch the story and plot itself are mediocre with the twist being predictable the script is filled with humour and the buddy copy chemistry between brie larson and samuel ljackson is great the movie is good but doesnâtmt offer anything different or fresh to the superhero genre i would have rated it a bit lower if this was not my first 3dimax experience
Mar 17 2019,positive,great origin story cant wait to see capt marvel in endgame
Mar 17 2019,negative,captain marvel is so strong that she is going to kill marvel movies the character isnt bad but she is never developed you dont relate or care for the character jackson is the only life support for captain marvel larsons acting is two dimensional  and could be replaced with a cardboard cutout her cat on the other hand was quite likeable  unfortunately the ending seemed almost cartoonish and anticlimactic not worth seeing in the theaters better as a rental
Mar 17 2019,positive,despite the controversy it was a good movie and larson was great im not a fan of hers one bit but she did well as captain marvel the story and structure was different than the rest of the marvel movies and didnt really feel like a marvel movie 
Mar 17 2019,positive,fun to watch and ties tigether a lot of loose ends for infinity war and endgame
Mar 17 2019,positive,captain marvel offers a refreshing narrative structure outstanding performances from brie larson samuel l jackson and ben mendelsohn and a decent charming story for this gripping heroine even though it mostly feels like a preamble to avengers endgame and its two directors cannot quite extract the full potential of this story
Mar 17 2019,negative,no build up weakness struggle or adversity and failed to climax the whole movie felt weightless and without stakes i see why some felt alienated and talked down too
Mar 17 2019,positive,very entertaining movie
Mar 17 2019,negative,the supporting cast of this movie was great and the special effects were pretty good but other then that there was nothing brie was horrible pacing was horrible and story was boring
Mar 17 2019,negative,show was lackluster mediocre storyline mediocre main character the delight of samuel l jackson and ben mendelsohn werent enough to save this
Mar 17 2019,positive,pretty wonderful i left the theater feeling powerful 4 stars instead of 5 because brie larsons performance felt somewhat uncertain but maybe thats appropriate for a character with memory loss
Mar 17 2019,negative,definitely its a bad movie bad character developement and bad script maybe acceptable if you dont know nothing about mcu and you watch it as a standalone movie it could have been a great movie the main character has potencial but they did many thing wrong and they went away too far from the comic the movie is full of incoherencies    the way nick fury loses his eye is super stupid
Mar 17 2019,neutral,not the worst marvel movie but there was just to many slow points and i felt like it couldâtmve been better the emphasis on the female role bled through to the supporting characters and even the music there was only 1 song that wasnâtmt by a woman iâtmm all for equality but i felt like they were trying to make a point where there wasnâtmt a need
Mar 17 2019,negative,i really wanted to like this movie and bree larson but unfortunately it falls way short the movie feels unnecessary and crammed in right before end game if mcu is serious about making cm a central character moving forward the origin story needed to start years ago as they developed so many others what we got was what felt like a rushed cliff notes version of that this movie felt as though you were dropped into the middle of a sequel and missed the original combined with larsons uninspiring performance no 90s music nostalgia or cat humor can make it no more than an average addition to the mcu
Mar 17 2019,negative,i had a very high expectation of this movie first time being disappointed by marvel it lacks depth character building it just ruins the timeline without  any explanation not gonna watch again and i hope this crap doesnt seep into end game
Mar 17 2019,negative,good character handled poorly she had no threat to make her interesting she didnt struggle to control her abilities or really struggle with anything at all shes the same at the start of the movie as she is at the end other than having her memories restored we think having the tesseract in the movie breaks already long standing continuity that howard stark was working on using it to kick off an energy race that would dwarf the arms race the relationship between captain marvel and fury is one of the major highlights of the movie their relationship within the movie was great and enjoyable the effects are top notch as always this is a marvel movie after all the deaging effects were almost completely unnoticeable the vast majority of the time you cant tell or forget on fury coulson on the other hand it was never not noticeable goose the cat steals the show and thats not a good thing for an action movie hes purely a mcguffin for the plot holes they wrote in in the first place the oddity of trying to create a lightspeed engine in a universe where they have faster than light transportation in the universe and in the movie it self also doesnt make sense either  for the first marvel female lead movie i expected a movie with substance at lest on par with that of wonder woman truthfully i was hoping for better not only did we get a subpar script we got one that didnt even respect the universe the movies have been creating for 11 years now youd think after this long of creating these movies marvel would have been able to do better than this c level of a movie i hope they can find their footing in future installments and truly deliver a story with captain marvel that does her justice and hopefully we can get the sexist bashing that men are all either pigs or dreadfully weak and stupid im looking at you fury 
Mar 17 2019,negative,it usues marvels typical formula which works well but its nowhere near my favorite marvel movie infact being quite honest its my least favorite all the moments that are supposed to be deep and important are very very cheesy and the feminist message couldnt be made clearer in this movie its pushed to a point where it feels overdone and cheesy this whole movie was just a big ol block of cheese 
Mar 17 2019,negative,captain marvel rides endgames anticipation to box office success while brie larson stumbles along the way  i found its  underlying theme to be found its  underlying theme to be hollow and passe and the most exciting aspect of the experience was the extra butter on  my popcorn  it will make money bc fans love the mcu but the that will be interpreted to double down and push garbage on an already addicted fan base
Mar 17 2019,positive,i was not a great movie was was just ok   one would probably enjoy it on first watch but not worth the hype
Mar 17 2019,positive,action packed funny and fun to watch it was quite beautiful cinematically
Mar 17 2019,negative,it was soooooo boring i left after 40 minutes
Mar 17 2019,positive,the best marvel film ever
Mar 17 2019,negative,it was not good at all
Mar 17 2019,neutral,i liked the film my wife didnt although it was occasionally slow it slowly drove to the final climax my wife who has enjoyed several marvel universe films weve seen iron man all three together as well as captain america and the first two avenger films the reason i am mentioning her thoughts is because normally we enjoy the films together in this case she had a completely different view she thought it was the worse of all marvel films i was confused at that stage and asked what she meant she said the plot seemed to not make sense she said the main character seemed suddenly unstoppable how is it she can destroy whole series of spaces crafts and massive space cruisers in the blink of an eye not having an understanding of the comic book character itself i wasnt quite sure how to answer her but replied well i thought the character was exactly that unstoppable i guess though it will be up to movie goers everywhere as to whether she is unstoppable
Mar 17 2019,positive,i dont understand all the hate for this movie it is good not great but i enjoyed it very much brie larson is a great actress and the entire cast is good a humorous exciting movie with more than a little girl power
Mar 17 2019,negative,yet another boring marvel moviem
Mar 17 2019,positive,didnt look at over reviews liked the movie
Mar 17 2019,negative,no character development whatsoever larson doesnt have enough charisma to go the rdj snarky smartass route her humor is more obnoxious than endearing very predictable from start to finish some of the fight scenes are hideously shot and no originality very pandering to say the least it screams desperation im a woman im strong smart and funny love me no
Mar 17 2019,positive,after all the hype i didnt expect this to be as good as it was i thoroughly enjoyed the movie didnt think it was as good as infinity wars but it was as good as any of the other single avengers movies id even consider seeing it again i think brie larsen did a fine job and samuel jackson did not disappoint
Mar 17 2019,negative,honestly wouldnt see this again
Mar 17 2019,positive,really good movie one of the best of solitary marvel heroes much better than thor 2 iron man 2  3 doctor strange and others    i hate that the movie suffers attacks from a lot of people without even see it first very positive image for womenâtms without being feminist the actress is charming good effects music etc very recomendable
Mar 17 2019,positive,fantastic movie nice backstory to some characters we get to love âlaterâ brie played the role very well i loved the stan lee tribute in the movie special effects was good character development was good canâtmt wait for end game
Mar 17 2019,positive,i really enjoyed this film it was never boring it was paced well brie larson is adorable and funny as well as being kick ass i enjoyed all the 90s trivia and seeing the younger up and coming nick fury and the younger agent coulson as well overall id say it was a fun and engaging origin story and i cant wait to see more of captain marvel 
Mar 17 2019,negative,good cgi dull and predictable plot average to poor acting big disappointment not looking good for end game
Mar 17 2019,positive,i though this installment and addition to the marvel universe was quite well done not as bad as most reviews pretend it to be and the low rating it got is more due to political reasons than it is about the movie itself which is sad and pathetic at the same time makes you question the credibility of the rating system altogether the movie review scene have become a political battlefield of trolls and alike    but back to the movie it isnt without plotholes but as like all marvel movies you have to suspend your believes yet again all the superheroes that matters seems to be white caucasians and the kree and skrull alien race can speak english okay captain marvel has a universal translator while the others humans have not and still understood what each other were saying and she doesnt seem to carry her translator with her all the time but okay suspend belief    other than that it was an entertaining super hero movie and brie larson did a good job in portraying a confused hero trying to find who she was brie was compelling funny rebellious  great chemistry with samuel jackson a good role model for the kids and towards the end she really makes you believe she can take on the universe and that is the accomplishment you need for a super hero movie
Mar 17 2019,neutral,go if you like samuel l jackson play fury otherwise its middling quality
Mar 17 2019,negative,brie larsons acting just felt phoned in she is playing one of the most powerful people in the marvel universe and it didnt feel like that not too mention skrulls are suddenly good and lastly the big moments just fell so short if it wasnt a marvel movie id give it a 2 but it is so it gets a one from me
Mar 17 2019,positive,i have nothing to prove to you  carol danvers was this movie perfect absolutely not but did i leave the theater feeling happy strong and empowered yes did i as a woman in the military leave the theater with a relief that a woman neither needs to become manly or be stripped of her femininity to succeed yes the character dynamics are great the scrolls are wonderful the plot gets lost at times as does the action scenes buts lets not forgot iron man 2 and thor 2 and age of ultron carol is wonderful because her story is that she is unapologetically herself and the least of her worries is pleasing people whilst completing a mission 
Mar 17 2019,neutral,i fell asleep several times during the lulls in the movie  the plot started off great but it didnt have enough depth i am a marvel fan this movie had too much feminism and not enough comic  i go to these movies to enjoy the comic i am a strong woman that has raised strong females and dont need a movie to tell me women can be strong too all comic fans  men and women  already know this  thats why we have female super heroes in our comics and video games
Mar 17 2019,positive,whats not to like superheroes good guys bad guys overcoming seemingly impossible challenges this movie is full of action  surprises the only complaint was the physical darkness of the film i kept wanting someone to turn a light on
Mar 17 2019,negative,could have been a lighter summer movie instead it was built up too high on hype and too close to endgame to stand alone and kind of boring 
Mar 17 2019,negative,so marvel can actually make a bad movie 
Mar 17 2019,negative,pointless power scale garbage character building oh wait the half ass character background was recapped by a child too young to know capitan marvels background but hey whatever sam jackson was the only reason to see the movie and he is treated like a child  asked to leave the room when the women are talking  and join the child
Mar 17 2019,positive,it was very entertaining and very enjoyable also it was done so well 
Mar 17 2019,positive,ive seen a lot of women pull the gender card for no apparent reason if the consensus is that the movie was average i dont see what gender has to do with it this wasnt a replay of what happened to the ghostbusters film the actress delivered 90 in the same tone no matter the dialogue and that made it hard for me to take her serious the 3rd act had the most action but it was basically a cgi light show i kinda liked the film but i was hoping for some context for avengers endgame this was more so an origin story and not a very good one in my opinion is it worth checking out sure was it an awesome movienah 610 at best
Mar 17 2019,neutral,the movie itself does manage to entertain but unfortunately it doesnt do anything original in the process it truly is a copy and paste marvel movie with the same tired formula that weve come to expect after 10 years of this it just doesnt quite cut it anymore    the casting was great with one huge exception san jackson was excellent as usual ben mendelsohn stole every scene that he appeared in and jude law was excellent as well that exception was definitely brie larson i admit ive been less then thrilled with her off screen antics but i set that aside and wanted to see for myself how she did portraying this character that honestly through the comics i dont really care for her acting was wooden she seemed more like a cardboard cut out of a superhero instead of a real person there was no connection to her whatsoever in the end i just didnt care overall she just came across as flat and boring with little to no emotional connection or caring    the story was cookie cutter and honestly there was no suspense or memorable battle or struggle at no point was i even remotely concerned or worried for any character or the outcome captain marvel is overpowered when a character can just destroy everything and anyone that stands in their way we are just left with an empty dull uninspired experience i hope this isnt the future of the mcu
Mar 17 2019,positive,this is one of the better origin stories it met all my expectations fun and a little bit corny at times looking forward to more captain marvel 
Mar 17 2019,negative,boring movie with no memorable scenes the best part was the end credits because i knew the horror that i was watching was finally over
Mar 17 2019,negative,this is the worst marvel movie ever made 
Mar 17 2019,negative,brie larsons acting is complete garbage the supporting actress who played her friend outacted her this is probably in the top 3 for worst marvel movies ever made my girlfriend fell asleep the people behind me fell asleep even one person next to me fell asleep very disappointing 
Mar 17 2019,negative,i saw this movie as a sneak peek through amc and it is absolutely the biggest waste of time ive ever seen in a sneak peekand i saw tyler perrys alex cross they have deleted my negative review at least 3 times this is going to be my last review before i delete the ap for this nonsense 
Mar 17 2019,negative,nope nope nope most selfish underdeveloped character in mcu can we back to real character development
Mar 17 2019,positive,good movie they tied it in well
Mar 17 2019,positive,one of the better mcu origin stories hits all the necessary story beats avoids feeling stale because of a good dose of 90s nostalgia and in my opinion excellent chemistry between brie larson and samuel l jackson 
Mar 17 2019,positive,awesome epic game changing captain marvel  is a movie for the times for every young girl lady and women in their golden years this movie was especially made for you every woman is a marvel every woman is a captain of their life they can build rocket ships fly to space nurture their families this movie will hit more 1 billion us dollars mark my words watch it and let its message resonate in your heart
Mar 17 2019,positive,great action and super fun origin story of carol danvers
Mar 17 2019,positive,dont let the trolls put you off quite enjoyed this with my family
Mar 17 2019,negative,a fair action movie but a disappointing superhero movie   the main character is never challenged and therefore never grows  resulting in a flat and boring story  even established character are shadows of what weve come to expect from them    this will pass the time a a nonthinking action flick  but isnt worth rewatching if youre watching for the plot or to thinktalk about the plot later skip this one there really anything here
Mar 17 2019,positive,brie and samuel best of the movie
Mar 17 2019,negative,it was honestly a boring movie captain marvel feels like she is over the top strong from the get go no character growth at all i would have rather watched it at home on dvd
Mar 17 2019,positive,ive watched captain marvel twice now and both times i found it to fun and funny  it was a great movie
Mar 17 2019,negative,too politically driven just like rotten tomatoesmaybe rotten tomatoes should change its name  to bought and paid for tomatoes   hmmm
Mar 17 2019,positive,this movie is fantastici love itno movie is perfectyou can feel how it makes you stay and watch it over and over im sure that we will see skrulls in secrer invasion and i know that captain marvel 2 will be awesome
Mar 17 2019,negative,it didnt live up to the hype
Mar 17 2019,negative,bad superman like character to impose female power to the viewers unlikeable main actress and unlikeable film only watch it if you are preparing for end game and you are bored
Mar 17 2019,positive,funny actionpacked and filled with easter eggs everything you want in a marvel origin story marvel studios has come a long way since iron man in 2008 and it shows this is the best origin story yet and i cant wait for the confident captain marvel to take on thanos in endgame sidenote brie larson and samuel l jackson have fantastic chemistry that creates a delightful onscreen dynamic between the witty captain marvel and a more naive fury
Mar 17 2019,positive,good addition to the marvel universe 
Mar 17 2019,negative,wasted i went to captain marvel with extremely low expectations so film could make at least a minimum effort to entertain me but alas he failed it is a pain to watch the collapse of one of the most beloved cinematic universe i do not know who can be satisfied by seeing a product of such a low quality definitely not me neither the acting of brie larson nor special effects nor the script nor the direction can claim a positive assessment marvel studio had all the necessary resources to do something really worthwhile but why should they do that maybe on the eve of the endgame everyone will go to the theaters as it turned out this is far from truth somebody can try to convince us that the film was a victim of bloodthirsty trolls but in fact there is only one victim  the viewer let the negative reviews disappear try to hide the truth but itâtms not so easy to fool us i hope that the voice of common sense will win because we in the end we deserved more for our sincere fan love
Mar 17 2019,positive,it was better than expected humourous when nick fury comes
Mar 17 2019,positive,amazing movie for marvel fans if you dont know the marvel universe you wont understand how it all connects i loved it cant wait for endgame 
Mar 17 2019,positive,i enjoyed this movie and frankly iâtmd like to see more action heroines in cinema however the feminist propaganda of this film is ridiculous and brings several cringeworthy moments that taint an otherwise great movie
Mar 17 2019,negative,story line was meh beginning was slow but got better much due to sam jacksons humor
Mar 17 2019,positive,absolute blast of a movie cant wait for the sequel
Mar 17 2019,positive,great fun and worth every penny
Mar 17 2019,neutral,disappointed the lead isnt that good of an actress she brings nothing the storyline is weak wonder woman was much better
Mar 17 2019,negative,the story is ok not great just ok  and i would have given it more stars except for the undertones that i did not appreciate
Mar 17 2019,positive,captain marvel is fun and action packed all the performances  especially nick fury  were great definitely check it out another win for marvelh
Mar 17 2019,negative,not good or badjust there this was definitely my least favorite marvel movie i was expecting big things since this character is going to save the universe and kick thanos butt the movie was kinda boring and brie had no charisma it seemed like she didnt even want to be there im also surprised the marvel folk didnt put more effort into this movie it was disappointing all around 
Mar 17 2019,positive,happy i did not listen to the people say bad things about this movie i liked it i bet you will like it as well but if you do not like it that is okay still go see it because we need more movies like this and less like the ghost busters movie more good movie with strong ladys less crap making it look like that cant do it 
Mar 17 2019,negative,this film feels more like a nick fury origin story oddly also feels like this was a plot from a time when marvel movies dragged and stalled for character development brie larson brings nothing as carol danvers emotionless and poor acting skills the least likeable mcu film since thor the dark world manufactured and stamped in time for avengers end game the special effects were great thats all
Mar 17 2019,positive,cant wait for the new avengers 
Mar 17 2019,neutral,captain marvel was a mixed bag for me main issue was carol as her character had nothing to care for and she didnt feel like the strongest marvel hero i dont thing she got marshal arts training fr the role didnt feel like she could keep up with black widow in a fist fight without her powers she is boring only action scenes with cgi digidoubles were enjoyable sam jackson made the movie float
Mar 17 2019,negative,watched to stay current with mcu that was a long slow movie goose was the best part 
Mar 17 2019,positive,how could anyone not at least like this movie  a little understated in some ways that is so much better than some of the stupid over the top stuff theyve been doing  could it be because of the female issue  that would be really sad but is probably true
Mar 17 2019,negative,i really didnt expect much from brie larsonshe really doesnt have a good track record for her acting skillsa wooden plank had more substance than her acting samuel l jackson however carried the moviehe definitely didnt disappoint with his wittiness and humor  the movie is worth watching just for him and even the cat was awesomejude law also played a great character in the mcuits so sad the movie focused on someone with no depth or facial expressions  twilight part  6 i definitely regret paying for this moviebut im glad i got it over with and just and fyithis doesnt connect with nothing  of avengers endgamein case you were wondering except for the spoiler alert  tessaract
Mar 17 2019,positive,this was a delight itâtms so nice to see female takes on some tropes that are well established with dudes like the cocky fighter pilot and the capable alien fury is at his most human and relatable and all the side characters have little moments that shine the child actors do a good job and again have little character moments that make them well rounded and interesting they took a simple concept and executed it well id recommend it for anyone but definitely for young women and teenagers itâtms something truly special
Mar 17 2019,positive,it was great not understanding why there were so many negative reviews cant wait to see avengers end game
Mar 17 2019,positive,exciting interesting plot with a twist loved brie larsontotally believable as a kickass superhero all marvel fans need to see this to follow the overall saga of the avengers
Mar 17 2019,positive,great movie must see directing and writing weâtmre all done well  captain marvel will give end game a run for its money as the first female marvel movie it was one done extremely well
Mar 17 2019,neutral,bland as brie larson saying the word bland nick furys origin story saved this movie from acting doldrums
Mar 17 2019,positive,45  pretty good flick definitely passed the bechdel test
Mar 17 2019,negative,unfortunately this did not live up to the hype at all  the script and acting seemed forced and contrived  overall the pacing of the movie felt long and slow except for the last 20 minutes unfortunately not enough time and content to save the movie    brie larson was a big disappointment  shes an oscarwinning actress but she was totally unsuitable for the carol danvers role  i dont know if its her fault or if she wasnt given much to work with from the director andor producer  aside from the odd smirk she showed very little emotion  i understand they want to portray captain marvel as a strong and stoic warrior but they went a little overboard  she seemed rather robotic    as for samuel jackson he didnt seem like he was into it  this wasnt the same nick fury wed seen before  of course because the movie is set in the mid90s fury needed to be shown as a younger and more inexperienced character  however samuel jackson seemed to be phoning it in for a quick payday    the movies saving grace aside from the cat is ben mendelsohn  he was awesome as the skrull character talos  its refreshing to see him cast in a stronger role  jude law was ok not bad but not great either
Mar 17 2019,positive,as a fan of the mcu it did not disappoint it was a super fun time in the theater especially alongside other mcu fans all looking forward and getting pumped up for the next installment  avengers endgame im fully on board now especially after infinity war producer kevin feige is a genius not sure how they did it but they built a film series empire that is coherent and solid in its continuity to all the trolls haters and male chauvinists trying to bring down the films rating get over yourselves and get a life the negatively is just sad and lame and completely unwarranted anyone giving this film 1 or a half star is just bonkers
Mar 17 2019,negative,yeah she did more standing up and posing than actual fighting no learning her powers just an expert right at the beginning so unrealistic a galactic cheerleader who got lucky w winning the superpower lottery p it was sooo slow the movie i literally fell asleep  no struggles everything was toooo easy for heri can go on but i digress dont waste your money in going to the theatre trust me wait for it on netflix
Mar 17 2019,positive,really canâtmt see what all the negative comments are with this film itâtms a good addition to the mcu and brie larson is a strong female lead and has really funny chemistry with samuel l jackson goose the cat steals the funniest moments it will be interesting to see how she will develop in the avengers endgame storyline
Mar 17 2019,negative,was below avg samuel l jackson and bennben mendelsohn were good though
Mar 17 2019,positive,i thought it was an average marvel film  carroll danvers fell flat as a charachter and never seemed to have any flaws she never felt like a real relatible person
Mar 17 2019,positive,skippable marvel flick that you could wait for the blu ray or dvd save your money for avengers endgame
Mar 17 2019,positive,such a good movie funny scenes good story
Mar 17 2019,positive,another fantastic outing by marvel studios however i was much more engaged with the side characters than our main player brie larson loved the detail to continuity to the overall mcu
Mar 17 2019,positive,slow in the beggining showed how the avengers were made reccomend to see
Mar 17 2019,negative,worse marvel film there is really really boring  j hope she dont ruin endgame with her being in it this could be the end
Mar 17 2019,positive,i was a little nervous about going to see if because the reviews i heard werenâtmt good i decided to go anyways and iâtmm so glad i did it was such a good movie well thought out and worth the wait
Mar 17 2019,negative,brie is not that great honestly politics aside this is still the worst marvel movie by marvel studios i have seen i am a huge fan of most of them but having an op invincible hero is bad when dc does it and when marvel does it
Mar 17 2019,positive,good popcorn movie 
Mar 17 2019,positive,movie was great better than expected almost did not go and watch this movie due to stupid comments by the actress
Mar 17 2019,positive,very entertaining film do not understand the haters on this brie larson and samuel l jackson are great as well as the many nods to the 80s culture great introduction to captain marvel 
Mar 16 2019,positive,one of the best marvel movies really ties everything together
Mar 16 2019,negative,boring as hell dont waste ur money
Mar 16 2019,positive,great movie saw it twice already and gonna see it a third time tomorrow
Mar 16 2019,negative,âmehâtm movie with a few funny moments very cheesy
Mar 16 2019,positive,it is a marvel origin movie like other marvel origin movies it is pretty good nothing amazing or super special but definitely a good movie and certainly very fun i would rate it on the marvel scale around a doctor strange or captain america the first avenger and definitely better than an ant man and the wasp or thor the dark world  im very tempted to give it a 5star rating just because there are so many 1star ratings from people who have not even seen the movie that only rated it because they dont like brie larsons politics which is absolutely ridiculous but i dont want to rate it higher if it doesnt deserve it its just genuinely said that rotten tomatoes had to change their rating system because so many trolls were trying to give this movie horrible ratings before it even came out just because of the main actresses politics this movie is about carol danvers it is not about brie larson it has nothing to do with her life so why would you care about her politics people need to learn to separate the character from the actor unless brie larson was some form of criminal there is absolutely no reason to not see this movie just because she is in it and she is definitely a very talented actress theres a reason she won an oscar people  tldr good not amazing marvel movie that sets up endgame very well and is on the higher end of the origin movies also dont let your politics or the actresses politics affect your enjoyment of a movie about a woman that became a super human and can fly through space shoot beams out of her hands and basically go super saiyan if you somehow cant enjoy this movie because of her politics then you are going to have a tough time watching any movie that exists ever made after 2000
Mar 16 2019,positive,really enjoyed this movie it had a good story line and wasnt full of nonstop cgi mass fight scenes like some of the marvel movies 
Mar 16 2019,positive,definitely doesnt deserve all the criticism its been receiving
Mar 16 2019,negative,absolutely terrible not on par with any of marvels recent movies so disappointing
Mar 16 2019,positive,thoroughly enjoyed it
Mar 16 2019,negative,it was alright i really wanted to like the movie there was little to no emotional connection i wish they had given carol danvers the story she deserved such a great character with so much potential this movie just fell flat for me
Mar 16 2019,neutral,generic and predictable  a miss used of the character
Mar 16 2019,positive,great origin story  cant wait to learn more
Mar 16 2019,neutral,it was okay nothing to go crazy over captain marvel was way over powered they are trying way too hard to lush the girl power agenda it was too obvious
Mar 16 2019,positive,captain marvel is a good film it has an engaging story a stellar cast and the cgi to back it up    weve seen in the past that it takes some time for an actor and their character to really settle in to the mcu ie that godawful first thor movie or the infamous iron man 2 and i cant wait to see brie larson develop into such an intricate web of stories and conflict
Mar 16 2019,positive,definitely the lowest tier marvel movie but not terrible worth a watch
Mar 16 2019,negative,i told my dad i liked ir but  it was very dissapointing  i wish they did not add this to avengers story  my excitememt for endgame is gone  i am so sad  tm
Mar 16 2019,positive,very solid movie very enjoyable although good its not in my top ten brie larsons portrayal of captain marvel was good although at times it felt flat i also thought the humour was misplaced at times ben mendelsohn was easily the best actor on the screen and imo stole the show from larson
Mar 16 2019,positive,great movie might be my new favorite hero
Mar 16 2019,negative,a fairly bland phase 1 marvel feeling movie that makes little attempt to captivate the audience with character development visuals or fight scenes brie larsons captain marvel is yet another incarnation of a mary sue trying too hard to be a feministic icon and being given no real personal struggle or development and being completely unchallenged by anything within the film a predictable outcome and a pity when other strong female characters that are good because they are well written and thought out pieces of a story that are strong because of their portrayal rather than having their gender rammed down audiences throats
Mar 16 2019,negative,complete garbage dont waste your time watching this worthless movie 
Mar 16 2019,neutral,generic marvel uninspired and lazy writing acting was mediocre
Mar 16 2019,positive,the overall movie wasnt the best marvel movie slightly boring at times but overall was decent
Mar 16 2019,positive,to preface this i thought the film was good for what it was although the film lacked crucial scenes and plot points that couldve made the film much more memorable i thought that the setting of the film didnt really have the significance to the story other the matter of furys pager   this film couldve taken place in 2000 or 2001 and with the most molecular changes couldve been the same exact film if the 90s were to shape the setting of the film they shouldve added a greater level of  culture   if the film took place in the earlier in the decade perhaps they couldve the grunge scene taken shape during that time and perhaps introduce the punkgrunge fashion  they couldve even depicted events such as the la riots
Mar 16 2019,negative,too corney and predictable seems like it was jammed together in order to bring captain marvel into end game almost as an after thought i had high hopes because captain marvel is a great mcu hero but it could have been much better than it was
Mar 16 2019,positive,the movie wasnt bad but not the best marvel movie either they back tracked on some of the marvel stories 
Mar 16 2019,positive,captain marvel is a solid superhero movie that falls slightly short of what is expected from a marvel studios film its colorful and exciting but lagged by slow pacing at times boring ending and forced feminism im very excited to see whats to come from carol danvers
Mar 16 2019,positive,so it had its moments but i fell asleep a few times and was mostlyunimpressed  brie larson has all of one look that we get to see sooooooo many times its annoying and less emotional range than even goosethe cat  really  the alltime dullest marvel hero ever thanks to casting this nonleading lady  her i dont remember who i am origin never really was interesting and her big i never give up finale moment was served to us entirely through a bunch of flashbacks because the actress couldnt have conveyed it herself    and the secret twist at the end was pretty damn infuriating to oldschool comics fans  altogether it was the most disappointing marvel film since the hulk and if we are lucky they will kill her off in endgame  there should not be a sequel with this dull actress
Mar 16 2019,negative,it lacks power and basically a plot
Mar 16 2019,positive,fantastic movie humor and action 
Mar 16 2019,positive,the movie was good as a tie in to the universe but as a movie that is supposed to get us the way iron man and gotgv1 got us engaged it leaves a lot to desire
Mar 16 2019,positive,so much fun storyline isnt anything amazing and i feel a few scenes could have been done better but a lot of parts reminded me of star wars and had a lot of fun the entire time
Mar 16 2019,positive,good movie nice vibes and funny chemistry between the characters
Mar 16 2019,negative,only saw it because im a samuel l jackson fan otherwise i wouldnt recommend it doesnt even give context for end game
Mar 16 2019,positive,very good movie i loved how it fit in along with the previous and future marvel movies great story line acting and cgi it is sad that so many are giving the movie an artificially low one star due to their feelings being hurt by bries desire for this movie to me more inclusive and motivating for women there is room for all at the table
Mar 16 2019,positive,not my favorite of the franchise however it was still enjoyable
Mar 16 2019,negative,liked the cat and the camio of stan lee
Mar 16 2019,negative,its ok but not great comparing to the other marvel movies i was excited to watch it because and i wanted to learn more about captain marvel so that ill know all the heroes in endgame but honestly if this wasnt a marvel film its not a good stand alone movie i really love samuel jacksons performance in the movie though
Mar 16 2019,positive,captain marvel was par for the course for a mcu movie so it was excellent
Mar 16 2019,negative,the worst movie ive ever seen
Mar 16 2019,positive,after hearing all the negative comments regarding the feminist flavor of the movie i was actually pleasantly surprised i didnt find it putting men down at all if anything its more of a feel good movie for young girls to dream big and a little nostalgia trip for us who grew up in the eighties  as for as the plot is concerned its essentially an origin story and in comparison to other marvel movies is no worse than spiderman homecoming or thor darkworld i particularly liked the plot twist regarding the kree and skrulls which was reminiscent of underworld starring kate beckinsale some reviewers didnt like the woodenness or the snarky attitude of danvers but i felt that that was just a creative decision by the director because as the story unfolds her demeanor changes somewhat if subtly  i enjoyed watching the interactions between danvers and the other main characters namely yonrogg fury rambeau tarog and marvell as well as the way the hightech universe of the kree was visualized in particular i liked the little touches such as the military protocol that the kree used personal questionnaire to weed out infiltrators or the way the supreme intelligence appears as someone familiar to the beholder  the shortcoming of the film is essentially in the action scenes where a little more thought could have gone into the choreography case in point towards the end of the movie danvers is subdued by the supreme intelligence but it is apparent to the kree soldiers surrounding her that she is fighting back possibly quite successfully instead of taking some kind of action ie fleeing attacking calling for back up or at least getting on guard they just stand there until she breaks free  captain marvel is an enjoyable pg movie for a sunday afternoon
Mar 16 2019,positive,captain marvel is everything that i wanted wonder woman to be and felt ww fell short of being its an empowering movie that doesnt beat the audience to death with the message it has strong realistic characters who are still flawed and human who overcome their emotional baggage without a lot of droll angst or doing it because their love interest is in danger it has so much action in it from the first minute yet still manages to have clever writing and it has a cat all in all a masterpiece of comic book movies
Mar 16 2019,positive,captain marvel is a brilliant film done 
Mar 16 2019,positive,it lacked momentum in the first half when it was mostly character background at the end i thought you dont need the other superheroes in marvel universe  she can destroy most of them and their armies the real hero is goose the cat 
Mar 16 2019,positive,watching this i really want to like bri in this movie but i feel she falls flat a lot this is not the type of movie you put out before endgame this should have came out years ago not the worst film just to  typical at this point we need to start getting different things in the franchise that make each entry different from the last
Mar 16 2019,positive,loved samuel l jackson as nick fury priceless it was a good movie worth watching but not one of marvels best
Mar 16 2019,negative,had so much potential i get wanting to set up the next phase i understand wanting to go in a new direction but marvel please do not sacrifice basic things like an actual story and character development just because disney execs still think that they can inject their new princess mentality into action franchises it did not work with star wars  will not work with marvel smh
Mar 16 2019,positive,most boring marvel movie i have ever seen but ill give it 3 stars because i love marvel and coulson was in it the movie just felt stale and a little generic
Mar 16 2019,negative,all i needed was the end credit scene asking where fury was the two hours prior were absolutely a waste of my time and poorly written sad that this is what they end it on 
Mar 16 2019,positive,it was okay watch it to set up end game and never watch it again
Mar 16 2019,negative,pretty boring first half dragged horribly
Mar 16 2019,positive,great movie ignore the trolls get excited to see an origin that will explain a few old marvel items add a new woman superhero and set up end games its 2019 we need more woman superheroes
Mar 16 2019,positive,whoever hates this movie clearly needs to see a doctor the movie has a combination of funniness and action which makes it outstanding
Mar 16 2019,negative,i went to see this movie regretfully  not really expecting much and was still disappointed  there were a few scenes that made me chuckle but overall i was just bored  im not at all a die hard marvel fan usually dont go to see the movies in theatres  but felt the need to see why its so widely hated  it is just not a good movie and the distasteful things the lead actress says and does just adds to it  such as her rude remarks when asked if she would attend the release in her costume
Mar 16 2019,positive,was a great movie with a good message for alk girls out there
Mar 16 2019,positive,it was action packed i liked the storyline overall 
Mar 16 2019,negative,tried to hard and you can notice i understand this movie had to be made but it couldve been much better 
Mar 16 2019,negative,worst lead actress tbh
Mar 16 2019,negative,far from marvels best i dont really engage in whatever online flame wars are going on with this moviebrie larson so i apologize if any of this has been said before    the movie felt very paintbynumbers but my wife and i would rank it as the worst of the nonsequel mcu movies i think thor 2 im2 and avengers 2 were all worse for example the effects seemed okay some of the humor but not all landed but the movie just felt kind of flat maybe part of it was that carol seemed focused on being too cool for school which wasnt particularly interesting or endearing and part of it was that i never ever felt carol was in any danger or trouble but i think a bigger part of the problem was there just wasnt that much to the movie    there wasnt really any sort of heros journey in play here beyond oh yeah im from earth and look im even more powerful than i knew wonder woman was a far more compelling movie and character and script while all the beats this movie tried so hard to hit keep getting up when youre knocked down felt largely unearned its a shame because i think the messages they were trying to convey are worthwhile but the script never earned those messages and carol as a character wasnt interesting enough for me to really care    the 90s setting was as superficial as everything else outside of the blockbuster the loading gag which was admittedly funny and the soundtrack this movie could have been set in any time period because it mattered so little contrast that to bumblebee which really really sold its 80s setting    so in the end 2 stars for a weak entry into the mcu i really wish theyd waited to introduce cm until after endgame so they couldve skipped the retcon nonsense that is so problematic on the comics side reworked the script another few dozen times and given carol a better introduction to the movie universe
Mar 16 2019,positive,marvel ends it streak of incredible movies but captain marvel is still very good nonetheless
Mar 16 2019,negative,entertaining dont know why a strong female character needs to be gay fury was lame colson was lame bre as c marvel was average   akira akbar as rambeau was acted poorly the rest were lame the worst actor i have seen on screen in my lifetime was lashana lynch unbelievably bad
Mar 16 2019,positive,it was not a great marvel movie and it was not a bad marvel movie i found it to be between ok and good
Mar 16 2019,positive,brie larson does an amazing job i dont understand any of the hate about her being captain marvel like this movie had some of the best action scenes in the mcu for solo hero movies anyway and had some really cool weapons of course its an origin story so her powers werent used to her full potential but this one felt fresh and wasnt alike with past origin story movies im very interested to see her in future movies and loved this one 
Mar 16 2019,negative,horrible like watching iron man one in 2019 did not learn from the sucesses of black panther or thor ragnorak furyâtms eye patch and how the name avengers came about had to be in this movie cause nothing interesting at all happened there were kree why do i care i cared about wakcaonda asgard guardians of the galaxy pirates crew and gold people this why her powers suck i have no idea why sheâtms the most powerful avenger from this movie tony thor hulk could have fought the villain in this movie with the same result she brings nothing to the table tonythor hulk and even black panther bring each a different exciting power this chick nothing sheâtms like superman boring bland just a powerful character thereâtms already a hot female avenger black widow so she brings nothing to the table and i hope she dies in end game this character should have been written in differently black widow is more interesting cause at least sheâtms a spy this is the worst marvel movie made by far and itâtms not even close i hate the captain america movies but i at least can acknowledge that captain american is still a good movie even if i hate the character but this trash i hate the character and everything in the movie the cat was the most interesting thing in this 2 hour crap cinema waste of time and money do yourself a favor pirate the movie with a group of friends crack a beer and talk trash about this movie from beginning to end because thatâtms all this movie is good for a joke
Mar 16 2019,positive,fun movie that will blend well into the mcu beginning of the movie was kind of slow but that was all build up to an exciting climax that showed just how powerful captain marvel is brie larson did an excellent job playing a superhero and samuel l jackson was great as a younger less cynical nick fury looking forward to seeing carol danvers again in end game
Mar 16 2019,positive,this is my new favorite movie i wasnt interested in superhero movies before this but this made me want to explore the mcu
Mar 16 2019,positive,pretty good for an origin story
Mar 16 2019,positive,first super heroine of marvel cinematic universe also i can already tell how nick fury got the eye patch on the left from getting clawed by goose the alien cat 
Mar 16 2019,positive,captain marvel was an awesome movie an important addition to marvels cinematic universe solid very enjoyable and entertaining inspiring
Mar 16 2019,positive,i went to this movie not knowing about the silly controversy about what brie larson said and really i could care less what she said i thoroughly enjoyed this movie
Mar 16 2019,negative,with 30 seconds left in the game were gonna put in a new quarterback that nobody on the team has ever played with or even heard of actually she herself hasnt even heard of her oh also she gets her powers from an explosion i dunno its the tesseract just go with it also the skrulls are super cute cuddly and just want to go home with their families christ not all of the marvel movies have been home runs but this is the only one that i can say that i actually hated
Mar 16 2019,positive,dont believe the negativity  in spite of how some tried to market the movie it doesnt go overboard with sjw rhetoric captain marvel is an aclass marvel movie and they do a great job as usual of tying so many things together  cant wait to see endgame
Mar 16 2019,negative,the action was meh at best oddly enough my wife was more let down by this then i was and she calmly exclaimed that this was the new green lanturn replacement i would have to agree
Mar 16 2019,positive,i went into this movie wanting to like it but came away with a neutral feeling i didnt hate it but i didnt like it either it really felt like i was watching a direct to tv movie hours later i cant really recall any memorable scenes the best actor was ben mendelsohn then lashana lynch i felt they really held back sam jackson he seemed so weak the fight scenes were also weak really felt like a tv series there were some lines that were poorly written and not appropriatecockpit as a lifelong marvel fan i would rate this movie along side the ant man series not great but not horrible either overall i dont think its necessary to see before endgame
Mar 16 2019,positive,this was an amazing and empowering movie the writing the acting and the cast was all perfect
Mar 16 2019,negative,i just wished they would cast someone different tired of the same cookie cutter female representation slj is still a true fav of mine and although i did love the overall storyline and amazing power reveal at the end i just wish i was watching someone different disappointed 
Mar 16 2019,negative,sucked worse movie for marvel
Mar 16 2019,negative,spiderman 3 was better than this
Mar 16 2019,positive,i actually seen it and there are great scenes it was definitely marvelous all characters were pretty much powerful and i donâtmt think itâtms about 90âtms nostalgic it pretty much explains nick furyâtms eye how he got the pager to contact her and explains how ronan went bad i also like the memorial of stan lee and his cameo i donâtmt think it was a waste of money it was definitely captain marvelous i havenâtmt seen all marvel movies but the ones i did see was definitely marvelous as well it was so powerful that it made a great person can come out of anywhere
Mar 16 2019,neutral,it was mehhh  i was kind of going for the bad guys towards the end
Mar 16 2019,positive,captain marvel is a good movie you get back drop of shield beginning too much drama being brought into this just go and watch its a super hero movie
Mar 16 2019,positive,loved the movie great interpretation of the source material awesome twist brie larson is a great addition to the marvel pantheon cant wait to see it again
Mar 16 2019,positive,perfect blend of humor nostalgia strength and plot development i loved it was never bored and itâtms handsdown one of the best movies iâtmve seen
Mar 16 2019,positive,movie is worth a watch but i wouldnt watch it again brie larson is pretty boring the character seems dry not much to her shes out classed by every other actor the cat is the best part of the movie movie basically has nothing to add to the mcu waste of a character
Mar 16 2019,positive,not the best marvel movie but definitely worth seeing especially in setting up for avengers endgame the synergy between brie larson and samuel l jackson is well done although it seems brieâtms character was limited to dry humor and a cocky attitude now that the movie has developed her character and personality more i see the character coming alive more in future movies iâtmd say this is a strong start for the new captain
Mar 16 2019,negative,just watched it pretty disappointing
Mar 16 2019,positive,solid movie good pacing great cast poor humor initially but gets better as the story progresses solid plot overall definitely rewatchable
Mar 16 2019,positive,this movie is vastly diffrent from any other super hero movie yet while captain marvel is a joyride of superpowered buttkicking  it is also a powerful example of what it means to be human and rise from our failures brie larson does an amazing job portraying the complex and constantlyevolving character of carol danvers this movie had me leaving the theater feeling empowered i have a new favorite hero
Mar 16 2019,positive,this is the first mcu movie i am disappointed in i loved the stan lee tribute and how it connected some loose ends but the story was lacking it didnâtmt hold you brie larson was a poor casting choice which is almost unheard of by marvel she just didnâtmt have any emotions it made her character hard to buy into it wasnâtmt horrible but it was a big let down compared to other mcu movies
Mar 16 2019,negative,boring and all over the place plot 
Mar 16 2019,negative,captain marvel is the most boring addition to the mcu brie larsons character carol danvers lacks so much personality that its almost impossible to establish any connection with her role not to mention larsons performance of a superhero is bland as they come she has zero character development throughout the film and theres nothing special about brie larsons performance that cant be done by a broad spectrum of actresses  spoilers ahead the plot is secondhand using the old trusted mentor was evil all along twist predictable and disappointing  the film is practically a middle finger to those who enjoy the marvel comic books changing facts and stories to fit the cheesy story line such as skrulls are simply a misunderstood race of alien refugees political angle there and nick fury lost his eye to a petty cat scratch  i watched this film because 1 i really hoped it would exceed my low expectations and 2 i didnt want to miss any key details for endgame  having seen it there was nothing relevant to endgame and my low expectations were extremely disappointed  antman 2 looks like a good film in comparison at least it was relevant  awful film not worth the time and money spent  on a final note i pray brie larsons role in endgame will be all but insignificant because the avengers that have been around for 10 years deserve to carry this saga to its conclusion without being carried by an unfamiliar face
Mar 16 2019,negative,such a letdown boring plot nothing special waste of time and money
Mar 16 2019,neutral,very disappointed this story had loads of potential but did not make any impact there is a complete lack of backstory and relationship building the beginning drags out yet does not provide enough of a story for the audience to appreciate it later on a guardians of the galaxy type of approach would have been great using 90s music and giving the adventurous feel brie larson appeared to lack charisma from time to time overall not a great precursor to the much anticipated avengers endgame
Mar 16 2019,positive,average marvel super hero movie taking in consideration that the first movie of captain marvel they did a good job
Mar 16 2019,positive,entertaining throughout some of the sequences shot to be iconic moments went over my head but didnt take me out of the movie     i enjoyed every performance brie larsons carol danvers behaved like i expect someone who cant remember herself nor the people who are closest to her would behavelike a shell of themselves with bits of their personality breaking through
Mar 16 2019,neutral,not one of my best marvel movies but it feeds into endgame
Mar 16 2019,neutral,while fun in some parts the direction of the movie is so weak that it holds back what should be a good marvel movie
Mar 16 2019,positive,there were things i appreciated more after the film most of the issues i had were direction but the plot script and actors were great
Mar 16 2019,positive,suprisingly fun with good performances  ovearll a midtier mcu film
Mar 16 2019,positive,good film about woman one of the best mcu movie good characters good sound good visual effects
Mar 16 2019,negative,this movie was a huge let down and i walked out the movie theatre thinking that i just had watched a marvel  version of green lantern the movie was a shit show that clearly all parties involved creating it did not care or wanted to strived  for anything beyond mediocre during its entire process of creation itâtms officially bottom of the list
Mar 16 2019,negative,kind of like watching paint dry but it never really does in this movie without sam jackson this movie would have no chance at raising ones pulse  its just plain silly and would be better off as a cw superhero type tv movie jude law seems like hes on auto pilot his acting similar to his role as the bad guy in the authurian fable directed by guy ritchie
Mar 16 2019,neutral,2 stars at best for me overall i dont think it could break into my top 15 mcu films     does the mcu really need this character really or is it just to tick a box the storyline was underwhelming and it seems as if there is no real weight to the character you dont seem to be able to relate with captain marvels arc if there is one in the same sense that you do with tony stark and steve rodgers which brings me to another point marvel are consistently releasing solid 810 films whereas this is a 610 at best the bar is set really high now for this franchise so a 5610 entry looks poor by comparison    on a more positive note this film faced many potential continuity issues and i feel that they have been addressed brilliantly the action scenes and the soundtrack were bang on but apart from that the film generally hovers around absolute mediocrity     after the titan that was infinity war the mcu has had two subpar entries namely this film and ant man  the wasp i sure hope endgame goes above and beyond to ensure the bar is matched or bettered
Mar 16 2019,positive,watch like you want to be told a story and the film does the rest    i thought the film was incredibly enjoyable and it was personally one of my favorite films of the past year
Mar 16 2019,positive,awesome  i loved captain marvels attitude and lack of a short skirt  the storyline was engaging the action exciting and the links to the rest of the marvel universe exciting stay for the postcredit bonuses  also the soundtrack was great
Mar 16 2019,positive,great movie canâtmt wait till end game canâtmt believe people dislike this movie
Mar 16 2019,negative,the best part of this movie is that you dont need to watch past the first 10 minutes to understand it completely it can be summed up in 2 memory scenes the first shes in a go kart and a boy tells her shes going too fast she ignores him flipping and destroying the kart the second shes training for the air force where shes swinging from 1 rope to another a man tells her she isnt strong enough this too falls on deaf ears ending with him being correct and her crashing to the ground from 10 feet up they both end with her rising from the dirt with a mixed look of determination and resting bface this is the entire movie an emotionless stick that breaks stuff ignores everyone elses opinions despite validity but she doesnt care so that makes her cool
Mar 16 2019,positive,a great addition to the mcu
Mar 16 2019,positive,as an origin story this one isnt bad the bonus of it as a prequel is that we get to see the origins of nick furys shield as well i went into this knowing very little of carol danvers and left with the impression that shes going to have a pretty major role in helping the avengers vanquish thanos it didnt get nearly as preachy as i thought it would given the loudest detractors on social media i think most of the attention there was on larson herself nevertheless as a film in the mcu overall this one didnt disappoint
Mar 16 2019,neutral,the jokes feel like theyre from guardians of the galaxy i laughed very few times it felt like there was a secret lesbian love backstory that went nowhere not that theres anything wrong with same sex relationships but it was ultimately boring please just take politics out of movies please for the love of god
Mar 16 2019,positive,enjoyed the movie on its own merits sure not the best of what the mcu has given us but i certainly had fun with it and look forward to this new characters involvement in avengers endgame
Mar 16 2019,negative,i like samuel jackson but it wasnt a very good movie im not sure where the character came from or why i never heard of captain marvel until now but id never heard of guardians before i saw that movie eitherguardians was way way better my kids thought this was going to be like wonder woman which was awesome but they started getting bored halfway through  theyre 14 year old twin girls and were pretty hyped butoverall disappointing
Mar 16 2019,positive,i dunno i diddnt think it was weird some of the song choices were out of place or targeting to certain people for unknown reasons but its was a meh movie for me not super exciting but not bad
Mar 16 2019,negative,movie was slow and doesnt fit with the others in the series they should have waited till after endgame to bring her character in
Mar 16 2019,positive,brie larson stumbles a bit at first but as the movie progresses she finds her footing and i find myself captivated in a naive sense of wanting to scream yes at certain parts of the movie     this stumblingatfirst seems intentional on the actors part it plays well for a person whose memory only stretches back half a decade     the movie itself can be a bit sketchy but so then were most of the actual 90s     im looking forward to seeing captain marvel in endgame
Mar 16 2019,positive,was expecting to find it meh and i was pleasantly surprised very entertaining 
Mar 16 2019,negative,captin marvel has no impact in this movie at all fury and goose steal the limelight theres more of an emotional connection with the skrull then the main character its an average origin story at best with none of the marvel heart and soul weve come to expect
Mar 16 2019,negative,sadly disappointing horribly acted and terrible cgi embarrassing
Mar 16 2019,positive,thoroughly enjoyed every flerkin minute of this movie  i honestly dont understand the low score  fun funny action filled and ripe with easter eggs for the mcu  carol danvers kicks butt  now we just need some other heroes that are at her power level like richard riders nova
Mar 16 2019,negative,badly acted hoakie music for the scenes maybe marvels worst move
Mar 16 2019,positive,this was a fun movie with an overall good feel
Mar 16 2019,positive,origin story so not the best for any superhero but the rest was solid  the so called subtext was hardly there  if you like superhero movies it is a good bet
Mar 16 2019,neutral,expected way more from this film  i was hoping to see a lot more carol and maria moments but we dont get much of them also nick fury was beyond pathetic didnt even look like that badass nick fury weve known for years from previous mcu movies all he did was to get emotional with goose in every chance he got even when he absolutely shouldnt  the action scenes are pretty meh and thats a shame for such a powerful character like they say carol danvers is i mean that how did you get the code scene what the actual fuck you dont ask such thing after getting your ass beaten up  marvels marketing campaign for this film had me expecting to leave the movie theater like omggggg but actually it hasnt gotten even close the mid and postcredit scenes managed to be better than the whole movie i was pretty disappointed but lets see how brie larsons gonna be in endgame next month
Mar 16 2019,positive,the first 2030 minutes were bad but then it gets way better very quickly
Mar 16 2019,positive,wonderfully fun inserts itself very neatly into the middle of the mcu timeline the amount of humor was just right the 3d effects were executed very well the effect to make samuel l jackson look 20 years younger was fantastic cant wait to add this film to my marvel collection when it gets released
Mar 16 2019,positive,another filler movie before avengers end game that was enjoyable and seemed to do well with the usual mcu formula we have seen before for our heros origin story brie larson i feel did well as carol danverscaptain marvel but the character didnt seem to have much of a character arc overall and finding out who she really was seemed to drag on a bit to the runtime the film did have some good fight sequences but the one near the end was a bit underwhelming to me and hard to follow for a little bit nevertheless samuel l jackson had a good performance as nick fury which definitely was one of the bright parts of the film and had very convincing deaging cgi at other times the cgi did look not that good and also had some connecting points to the avengers movies which do go into spoiler territory the humor i did really enjoy and felt that it belonged in the film and didnt feel too forced in the end while it may not be a groundbreaking film in the mcu captain marvel definitely enjoyable to watch as you get excited for avengers end game
Mar 16 2019,neutral,very slow in the middle as an origin story its weak but as a mcu entry its not bad if only for the sheild origin stuff black panther was the weakest entry but now its this one
Mar 16 2019,positive,i really liked the movie typical fun filled humor infused marvel movie love the 90âtms nostalgia brie larson was good no complaint a different funny side of agent fury overall a good movie
Mar 16 2019,negative,nothing new and only one character had any likeable moments i was hoping to see some innovation character development or furtherance of the overall avengers plot instead this movie only offered onedimensional characters dubious stereotypes and continuity problems not marvels best showing
Mar 16 2019,positive,fun but formulaic and predictable
Mar 16 2019,positive,one of the best solo mcu films hands down brie larson did a great job carol danvers was fun relatable and badass i cant wait to see her take on thanos
Mar 16 2019,neutral,it was ok it wanted to be more silly than an action movie i cant picture her leading the next set of avengers right now
Mar 16 2019,positive,great movie itâtms fun to watch it ties up some loose ends in the mcu itâtms hard to understand if you havenâtmt seen previous marvel movies itâtms not quite as funny as some of the other movies but definitely is still awesome to see
Mar 16 2019,negative,this is the worst thoughtout marvel film in the franchise this felt extremely forced upon us disappointing
Mar 16 2019,positive,middle of the road as far as marvel movies are concerned it was good but not great looking forward to end game
Mar 16 2019,positive,i liked it quit bitching about larson
Mar 16 2019,negative,if you think hadyn christensen added something to the star wars universe with his acting chops then this movie is for you otherwise expect the bland and you wont be disappointed blech
Mar 16 2019,positive,despite what socalled trolls say or imply the reviews already posted were right in that the story did need some polishing was a little disjointed and could have been better there were places i cheered bc i live to get into the story but like glass it needed a rewrite  the hardest thing to do is space with aliens the misdirection was fun and welcomed unlike browns inferno who had the heroine be the bad guy  what was done well was captain marvel developing her growing power but im still confused how annette bennings mar vell had to do with it i also didnt like her as being cast  several things were distracting and cant put my finger on but the infinity war tease during credits was awesome  i love strong female leads i wanted to enjoy this movie more
Mar 16 2019,negative,very soso movie its okay i wish i wouldve waited till it came out on netflix
Mar 16 2019,positive,solid mcu entry see it
Mar 16 2019,positive,had lots of fun with this movie
Mar 16 2019,positive,the movie was honestly one of the best marvel films i have seen to date it was amazing brie larson definitely gave us an incredible performancei love the fact that it was set in the 90s the songs that were featured in the film are iconic and i really liked the overall message please watch and support this movie and stop unfairly judging it because you didnt agree with what brie larson said about the lack of diversity in film criticism which was actually legitimate and the truth i promise you wont be disappointed
Mar 16 2019,positive,so i honestly went into captain marvel thinking that it was going to be bad but i was honestly pleasantly surprised the movie overall was pretty entertaining and had a unique plot i thought that samuel jackson did a great job as nick fury and brie larson was actually alright the only thing that really bothered me about captain marvel was how arrogant and sarcastoc she was at times otherwise it was a pretty solid movie
Mar 16 2019,negative,lack of character development makes it difficult to care for the protagonists
Mar 16 2019,positive,i really enjoyed the movie true they sort of jumbled the various incarnation origins along with the latest mcu vision of the kree so it wasnt like any of the comics but it was fun and well done the quality of the 3d was one of the better mcu jobs so far and that added to the movie i wish they had an imax 3d version but regular 3d was very good the sfx were just right  not too over the top the period work was actually quite good none of the strange little flaws like in some of the other mcu movies where they do things like mess up license plate colors for the state they are supposed to be in enjoyed all the performances as well as the sfx and the plot moved well right to the end cant wait to get the 3d blu ray when it is available
Mar 16 2019,negative,felt like an actor playing a superhero not a superhero being a superhero also felt as though it was extremely mediocre and it isnâtmt going to do any good for the mcu yeah
Mar 16 2019,negative,dont let the paid critics giving glowing reviews for free attendance in future films fool you as a film it is exceptionally bland even with the mighty nick fury showing little to no unique character development of ms danvers hope that this rather grey element of the mcu does not ruin the chemistry between the avengers in the final film
Mar 16 2019,positive,i liked the movie overall its an interesting origin story in that it takes place before the other marvel movies except captain america pretty good story but carol really does have any weaknesses and she comes off as kind of snooty the entire movie good soundtrack 
Mar 16 2019,negative,captain marvel is kind of hot but the best part of the movie is the cat 
Mar 16 2019,positive,vastly entertaining origin story setting the stage for avengers endgame there was a lot of material covered in a very short time making for a frenetic pace that could prove confusing for some people 
Mar 16 2019,positive,absolutely marvelous alsoâ good kitty
Mar 16 2019,negative,ok action screens but what really ruined the movie is all the unnessary dialog pushing some of the crazy thinking thats going on these days wish action movie makers would just stick to making a good movie instead of pushing all the political stuff
Mar 16 2019,positive,totally loved the movie refreshing funny female empowerment brie larson showing why she won an academy award
Mar 16 2019,positive,good movie iâtmd recommend seeing it at least once a little start but great once it gets going
Mar 16 2019,positive,it was a great story  very entertaining and explains how and why she will be appearing in the last avengers movie  i like it
Mar 16 2019,negative,just bad and boring also nick fury lost his eye because of a cat
Mar 16 2019,positive,i add three stars because compared to all the others movies in the mcu it is just okay i do believe it does not deserves so many bad reviews but i understand why people might dislike it it depends way too much on endgame and we marvel fans might only enjoy it because we know what comes next endgame i have to compare it to black panther because someone who knows nothing about the mcu can enjoy black panther and someone who watches captain marvel might just think heeeeh its okay
Mar 16 2019,negative,was very bad the acting and the plot is the worst part  i personally think this and the 2nd thor is tied for the worst marvel movies
Mar 16 2019,negative,so i am supposed to root for an intergalactic bully who uses her unearned superpowers to hunt down innocent refugees wow did this movie miss it is ugly the actual music not the retro 90s playlist is noticeably lousy and i have to say it   brea larson is really nothing in this not bad just nothing rather bratty should i root for her because she got up got up to bat a second time literally i watched the wonder woman battle field scene after coming home from this snooze fest and the difference being gal gadot gave me goose bumps larson makes me look at my watch and think is this really a marvel film
Mar 16 2019,negative,this movie would be ok to watch on hbo like the last jurrasic world it was predictable and it overused cg the movie was pc and lost its story to it no weakness from the hero hope marvel does not decide to go down the rabbit hole in future films maybe gotg spoiled me
Mar 16 2019,negative,the movie was a huge disappointment for an entry in the marvel cinematic universe this far late in the game it makes many missteps and unforced errors for something that isnt trying anything new if guardians of the galaxy hate landed this flat on its face you could at least have argued that they were trying something different and new but captain marvel breaks no new ground and ironically attempts to change the foundations of the mcu the acting is overall good with stand outs samuel l jackson and ben mendelssohn but the script and direction are what truly brings this film down one of the most forgettable mcu   films in their canon
Mar 16 2019,negative,needs a better character build up and portrayal and dont forget good story telling and by the way it is way too rushed
Mar 16 2019,positive,anyone who is critiquing this movie poorly because of the casting  acting is clearly doing it based on politics this movie is great and larson was incredible her understated nature was perfect the themes of empowerment and inclusion were executed perfectly with emotion my only fault with the film was that the first third of the movie seemed less tight than the rest in terms of plot development and humor but this is an incredible mcu movie and worth rewatches 
Mar 16 2019,neutral,felt very much like one of those side tracked less interesting stories someone has to tell you so they can finish their main point black widow was more interesting in her first scene in iron man than carol danvers was in this whole movie
Mar 16 2019,positive,this is my favorite marve movie by far
Mar 16 2019,positive,really funny brie larson worked the character well and everyone fit into place great
Mar 16 2019,positive,was a great movie itâtms not a feminist movie itâtms just another great marvel movie to see
Mar 16 2019,negative,sorry but the movie was just mediocre at best and for a marvel movie especially one advertised this big thats an equally big disappointment i dont care about the heroines gender or skin color i loved wonder woman and alita to death but this movie is just skipable and it makes you fear for endgame as captain marvel will be a big part in it darn
Mar 16 2019,positive,solid movie visuals get a little trite near the end but the characterization and story carry it
Mar 16 2019,negative,kept on wanting it to be over after the first 20 minutes
Mar 16 2019,negative,a character to powerful but too weak in charisma to carry the movie like she is supposed to thanks to this classic marvel studio formula the main character is too strong to experience any kind of struggle or growth that would make her seem more humane and relatable
Mar 16 2019,negative,disappointed to say the least itâtms also unfortunate this weak character will be involved in a stellar avengers cast
Mar 16 2019,positive,capitana marvel is a correct movie that keeps you looking at the future of the character although it is still disappointing some things that were done with some characters it is also highly recommended
Mar 16 2019,positive,very entertaining especially liked the cat scenes
Mar 16 2019,positive,best film with female protagonist
Mar 16 2019,positive,after all i heard about this movie i expected to watch two hours of bantant feminist narrative pushing i was pleasantly surprised to find that there was little to none of that i was rooting for her the whole movie and her character wasnt shallow or unrelatable
Mar 16 2019,positive,i was pleasantly surprised with this movie based on the reviews i was honestly expecting it to be bad i was expecting it to be overly political and feminist i admit it was political and feminist but not as bad as i was expecting it portrayed most men as misogynistic aholes with only a few shown in a positive light ive seen brie larson in a few other movies and i think shes a pretty good actor but in this movie i didnt care for her performance i know she can do a good job so i dont know if its the directing or the writing but her performance was pretty bland i didnt really feel anything from her character at any point during the movie most of the other actors were just ok even samuel l jackson wasnt as awesome as he normally is but he still did a good job lashana lynch did a pretty good job too but sadly she wasnt in the movie that much there was only one actor who did an awesome job and that was ben mendelsohn as talos he did a great job and was by far my favorite character in the movie the skrulls were the best part of the movie which shouldnt have been the case because theyre supposed to be the bad guys and the main character and hero should have been the best part the action was honestly pretty weak there was no part in this movie where it felt like there was any great danger for anyone the best parts about this movie were funny the funny ones the humor is what made me like this movie because the other aspects of the movie were lacking overall this movie was a little better than just ok its definitely not the worst marvel movie but it is far from my favorite i will still buy the movie when it comes out because i want to own all of the mcu movies but i feel that they could have made this movie much better than what we got
Mar 16 2019,positive,whilst not the best it was yet again a solid marvel entry which the whole family enjoyed
Mar 16 2019,negative,so i just finished watching this movie it wasnt as bad as some people are claiming but it was certainly one of the weaker marvel movies for me the story was a bit all over the place and the acting felt wooden and emotionless in places i was looking forward to the 90s nostalgia thinking it might have a slightly guardians feel but the only thing that really reminds you its the 90s was blockbuster the movie also ignored the timeline with the tesseract and thor in the avengers nick claims its the discovery of thor and alien life that makes them build weapons and set up the avengers ready to fight whatever comes next but in this movie nick has been into space boarded a space station and had a chats round a dinner table with aliens and the cat thing was just childish seriously who would take a cat on a space ship that they just found then there is the captain marvel name which no one ever calls her and they never explain this movie sets up there character ties up her story and leaves no unanswers questions or any real reason for you to want to see her again until tonight i was really excited to watch endgame but after seeing this and knowing that she is all powerful and the key role in defeating thanos i can t help but think shes just going to undermine everything the avengers have been through and fought for watch it and make your own mind up personally after this and the over hyped cgi mess that is black panther im seeing the end go the marvel golden age
Mar 16 2019,positive,another good movie that ten or twenty fans wanted to take down i loved it 3
Mar 16 2019,positive,i thought overall it was a solid film there was a compelling story and a great twist i believe the movie could have showed us her powers a bit more but did a good of enough job to establish the baseline of her abilities iâtmm sure some people will be mad about the nick furry eye incident but i thought it worked perfectly there were a lot of great lighthearted tid bits here and there to keep the movie from being too serious
Mar 16 2019,positive,i thought the movie was satisfying in many ways and i thought it sent a powerful message i dont know if its my favorite marvel movie but it is in now way a bad movie
Mar 16 2019,positive,hands down the second best character introduction movie because nothing beats iron man
Mar 16 2019,negative,completely forgettable
Mar 16 2019,positive,kids loved it  like how they tie in to avengers and provide backstory for shield  i can see where some die hard marvel fans would take issue but for the rest of us that like the super hero fantasy movies this is a great new character
Mar 16 2019,negative,slow moving lackluster a huge disappointment  i could not even make it half way through
Mar 16 2019,positive,this is a true super hero movie for the whole family we took our 9  10 year old granddaughters to the movie and we all loved it one of the top marvel movies in my opinion 
Mar 16 2019,positive,great origin movie cant wait to see captain marvel kick some thanos butt in avengers endgame 
Mar 16 2019,positive,amazing another incredible marvel movie itâtms a must watch
Mar 16 2019,positive,just back from seeing captain marvel i have to say i think i have a new favorite superhero
Mar 16 2019,positive,there is no heros journey in this movie i could not connect with this character
Mar 16 2019,negative,some aspects of the film i enjoyed namely the opening 15 minutes after a while i found it quite boring  plodding and the worst of all the mcu films to date
Mar 16 2019,positive,not bad overall honestly i liked the most recent tomb raider better captain marvel ends like lucy is there any risk to her at all by the end
Mar 16 2019,negative,i would rather see elektra than this crapsaying that leaves a sulfer taste in my mouth
Mar 16 2019,positive,its a well done movie brie larson did a good job as captain marvel samuel jackson was as awesome as always the story line wasnt quite what i expected but it still worked out good the special effects were well done if you liked the thor movies youll probably like this one i think the negative word the movie has gotten online is very undue
Mar 16 2019,positive,very much enjoyed this movie a little campy at times but fun great soundtrack as well look forward to a sequel and end game
Mar 16 2019,positive,barely ok youll be better off seen on dvd
Mar 16 2019,positive,great movie definetly do not deserve the critisism
Mar 16 2019,positive,i really enjoyed captain marvel  pacing a bit slow sometimes and i wish their was more action
Mar 16 2019,positive,its a nice movie but actually people who says its a bad one are the marvel geeks who just want it to be the greatest movie in the history and just be better than wonder woman and they cried when they found it all about feminism
Mar 16 2019,positive,this moviesâtm plot twists and turns show the ever shifting nature of whoâtms good and whoâtms evil this is one of the best prequels that one will get to watch in this time
Mar 16 2019,positive,thoroughly enjoyed captain marvel  great cast tricky story and top notch visual effects   not as violent as most marvel series
Mar 16 2019,positive,brie larson is captain marvel i loved how they showed of her power there is power in just being human
Mar 16 2019,positive,powerful fresh and finally not another overly sexualised superhero
Mar 16 2019,positive,im glad the reviews are starting to reflect the actual movie and not predetermined haters artificial panning of it i can attest the audience score was minimally cut in half by haters that didnt even see the movie i give this a 7580 depending on how you feel about cats found sam jackson much more entertaining than in the past mcu movies i prefer marvel movies over dc for their character development of others than just the main character only big complaintneeds more agent coulson
Mar 16 2019,negative,cheesy weak jokes bad acting and bre makes a horrible captain marvel 
Mar 16 2019,positive,story introduces the scrulls and a alien cat nuff said
Mar 16 2019,positive,really enjoyed it good fun couple interesting twists and written decently to get between point a and point z ie  what we knew from the mcu movies to date
Mar 16 2019,negative,thought it was going to be terrible i was right 
Mar 16 2019,positive,captain marvel was a lot of fun to watch thats what movies are supposed to be fun
Mar 16 2019,positive,i thought this movie did a great job of introducing fun and interesting twists to the mcu timeline while also filling in blanks it was great seeing the girl power of the film in a way that is very relatable to the journey women have been and still are undertaking today 
Mar 16 2019,negative,competent but theres nothing new here a few good grrlpower moments
Mar 16 2019,positive,i think it was cool and the action is great i like it change my mind
Mar 16 2019,negative,it was a waste of time
Mar 16 2019,positive,loved it  an awesome addition to the marvel universe  great story great action and fem power galore
Mar 16 2019,positive,fun and entertaining a great addition to the marvel movie universe
Mar 16 2019,neutral,this movie had lot of potential but suffered the same errors as justice league in terms of continuity and unstructured use of plot say what you want about larson but her acting was relatively okay the movie also tries way to cram up these storylines and shifts focus the action was from entertaining to mediocre it feels like it only serves its purpose for endgame
Mar 16 2019,positive,its a popcorn movie and nothing more
Mar 16 2019,positive,very good movie with few flaws here and there therere questions about a few thing but movie is very good overall
Mar 16 2019,negative,went to watch captain marvel with the high hopes it would be another awesome marvel movie  went with a group of friends and some thought it was okay and the rest of us thought it was really bad  story was okay special effects were really good but the cheesy scenes were equivalent to the dare devil movie  for a moment i thought i was watching a mib men in black movie  thought the nod to stan lee was really awesome  suggest you wait to watch and not spend ridiculous theater prices  very disappointed
Mar 16 2019,positive,it was ok it was action packed and humorous but it just seem to be missing something
Mar 16 2019,neutral,fun comic story and origin movie but not consistent with comic canon no quantum bands
Mar 16 2019,positive,the movie wasnt preachy or santized it was a marvel movie it was fun thoughtful and actionpacked its a worthy addition to the mcu and the casting was perfect
Mar 16 2019,positive,kickass entertainment gorgeous production values ties together numerous story lines great job all the way around
Mar 16 2019,positive,good movie good effects a script a bit lame but acceptable warm main characters and irrelevant secondary characters but sufficiently developed to entertain you even so with his good points it was disappointing the film has a problem that neither wonder woman nor alita battle angel had and that marvel left the bar very high from the beginning they tried to make us see that the film would be the jewel in the marvel crown and the film that would revolutionize the way women are seen in the cinema at a certain point i agree with that because i believe that the film manages to be in an incredible way a banner of feminine power the problem is that people did not go to see a movie about feminism but to watch a movie about superheroes and thats why the movie fails it is not bad how this film develops but marvel made the mistake of selling it as the best of the best and the problem is that if marvel says it it must be true it can not be acceptable it can not be good it can not even be surprising or outstanding the film needed to be perfect and thats what disappoints it its pretty good but it was not enough it was just disappointing and it went away a cold note about this they should not sell it like that they should have acted like warner bros did when they pulled out wonder woman they did not rush to say that it was the best of the best and that it would change the way the cinema saw the female genre no no no no she went and demonstrated it on her own without needing sobriety for that reason when it was published there were no complaints from anyone because we knew that they had won all the merits attributed to them but hey the actors did not do it wrong hopefully the sequel will not make the same mistake as this movie
Mar 16 2019,neutral,it was ok  it had some funny bots  hardly anyone in theater  the one complaint i had was nick fury was never such a dufus  captain mavel being emotionless was reasonable due to the script even some of the male dominint memories was reasonable due to plot  hard to talk about without giving plot away
Mar 16 2019,negative,this movie was okay but probably not one that i would see again its definitely the weakest of all the mcu films except maybe iron man 3 this movie was especially disappointing to me as someone who loves both disney and marvel as it just didnt live up to the mcus usual quality the movie was sort of boring and the humor was really weak    the movie is supposed to be really empowering for women which would have been cool if they had done a good job with it doing a good job means making a movie with awesome strong female characters who are likable and welldeveloped see wonder woman for reference i say this as a woman and honestly wish that there were more high quality femaleled movies this was definitely not one of them    if you have to keep verbally reminding me throughout the movie that your main character is strong and a woman or feel the need to put down others in order to make this point human male threat low to none you clearly are not very confident in your ability to convey a strong female character im not sure if these moments were supposed to be funny but to me they just seemed lazy and super cringeworthy it leaves me wondering if the filmmakers were lazy bad at their jobs or just think that moviegoers are stupid and need to be told everything that they should be taking away from the movie    while this last point really irritates me im giving the movie 15 stars because it wasnt totally awful i was just super disappointed because i expect higher quality from disney and marvel and this was mediocre at best
Mar 16 2019,positive,i truly enjoyed the film i loved that i was surprised at the beginning and all the twists and turns of the movie brie and sam do have a great chemistry and their teamup seems so natural and enjoyable to watch bries captain marvel is focused and determined as well as funny seeing fury and colson was another highlight for me and i loved that we get to see an earlier version of them than what we have seen i really enjoyed this movie and i highly recommend
Mar 16 2019,positive,my wife and i loved it it was a really fun movie she is an awesome hero love her powers
Mar 16 2019,positive,a heartwarming story and a ultra powerful female superhero love it
Mar 16 2019,positive,iâtmd give it a 85
Mar 16 2019,positive,the movie is awesome the actors play at the highest level i think this is all you need to know about the movie
Mar 16 2019,positive,i absolutely loved this movie itâtms definitely my favorite marvel movie so far and iâtmm so excited to see more of captain marvel the movie does a great job of explaining her origin and itâtms everything i expected and more
Mar 16 2019,negative,should have stayed true to the actual backstory should have picked a better actress stiff and out of sorts during action scenes 
Mar 16 2019,positive,absolutely wonderful  engaging funny compassionate a cracking story canâtmt wait till my daughter is old enough to see it  carol is inspiring
Mar 16 2019,negative,worst marvel movie i ever watched so far she is the most unlikable heroheroin in marvel cinemaric universe and the only reason why this movie is doing ok financial wise is due to past history of marvel movies doing great plot is boring and none of the character stands out except well done cgi samuel jackson i see why people were getting upset with this movie now and i regret not listening to my friends
Mar 16 2019,positive,brie larson is not a good actress everything she did looked awkward and all the humor was provided by samuel l jackson
Mar 16 2019,negative,awful actress awful scenario managed to destroy marvel universe so far marvel was ahead of dc 100 steps here dc with wonder woman managed to get ahead of marvel
Mar 16 2019,negative,boring and kind of slow
Mar 16 2019,positive,i loved it saw it twice already
Mar 16 2019,positive,i went into this movie not knowing what to really expect and found my self really enjoying the movie i would say its my 4th favorite movie in the mcu
Mar 16 2019,negative,i did not enjoy this film  ive been a fan of the franchise from the very beginning and this has got to be the worst of all  if youre going to push a political agenda at least make an effort with your narrative
Mar 16 2019,negative,the movie was kinda flat cgi was poor the hero character was flat and dull she doesnt grow like the other heroes were used to see i dont know how to explain it felt like an actress playing a superhero character felt forced and unnatural unfortunately even samuel l jackson wasnt that good either the vilain was bad explored   what can i say i feel frustrated cuz i wanted it to be a good movie and have fun at the cinema
Mar 16 2019,negative,this is terrible movie badly made badly acted bad characters and a poor representation of real strengths of men and women  i wouldnt show this one to my kids
Mar 16 2019,positive,i came in to the movie not knowing anything at all about captain marvel ive enjoyed the mcu movies overall without being a huge comic follower and this movie was no different  there was enough of a backstory to explain who she was and how she was special but enough tie in to the end of infinity war to leave me anxiously awaiting endgame
Mar 16 2019,negative,i dont know if it was brie larsons acting the writing or both but something about this movie felt really off it was pretty subpar for a marvel movie
Mar 16 2019,positive,this one is hard but ultimately it would have been a much better movie with a different lead actress she struggled to be interesting and unique 
Mar 16 2019,positive,maybe seems a bit duller due to the high marvel standards still captaim marvel manages to be an entertaining movie with a great performance from samuel jackson and a refreshing point of view from its female director anna boden being brie larson the only low point with a surprisingly not so charming performance
Mar 16 2019,positive,while not as good as wonder woman in my opinion it is not bad regardess of what the haters may say
Mar 16 2019,positive,goose the cat better be in endgame funny great movie
Mar 16 2019,negative,horrible movie no emotion from brie larson overly stuckup arrogant  facts are all wrong timeline is messed up  worst marvel movie ever
Mar 16 2019,positive,this was a well written family friendly film with great humour and action sequences it ties into the mcu well while also expanding it even further the actors were great and goose the flerkan cat was hilarious overall 455
Mar 16 2019,negative,so disappointing this had everything about it to be my favourite marvel movie i love sci fi and the comic book movies and the basic story was excellentbut i guess the problem was the script more than anything else   right away we know the skrulls copy people making them the ultimate spies and they can probe peoples memoriesâso they would have to do a really good job to convince someone who has only ever known since coming into the war to hate them that she is on the wrong sideâi was waiting for her to just not believe themâbut they got her to trust them very easilyâridiculous  in the same scene carol goes from an amnesiac to total recall after being told what a good person she isâall of a sudden âclickâtmâim backââjust stupid  i can forgive the no doubt song being totally out of place in a fight scene and i guess i can look over the way fury loses the eyeâ  brie larson is a fine actress but the script makes her look badâand the major scene that is key to the movie falls flat and it takes a while to warm up to marvelveers at all  one thing i will sayâi didnâtmt like the first captain americaâwinter soldier was amazingâso id have some hope for a sequel to captain marvel in the same way  ps â i hope someone says to her âwhere the hell have you beenâtm in endgameâafter she either isnâtmt sent for or doesnâtmt respond to pages in previous emergencies for the avengers
Mar 16 2019,positive,ä think brie larson isnt appropriate  to role
Mar 16 2019,positive,great origin story with some interesting twists and great links to previous stories i loved it
Mar 16 2019,positive,i really liked the movie it was kinda different from the usual marvel movies this movie had some bit of action but had more of a story and the way it was presented was pretty unique and my mom who doesnâtmt like to watch movies specially action movies actually really enjoyed watching this movie
Mar 16 2019,positive,really good movie 1 or 2 scenes look really cgi overall a good and enjoyable movie
Mar 16 2019,positive,unexpected and extremely well done brie larson really shines in this role and makes carol the kickass role model sheâtms meant to be it was an excellent mix of comedy heart felt moments and action ten out of ten would deffinitly watch again and again
Mar 16 2019,positive,just what we needed loved it
Mar 16 2019,negative,the film left me wanting more i was expecting to see some character growth and was very bored with the movie leading up to the final act of the film goose and fury were one of the best parts of the movie i wish it were better but i would not see it again
Mar 16 2019,positive,not the best but still a pretty good mcu movie could maybe make my top 10
Mar 16 2019,positive,captain marvel is no wonder woman which is why i only gave it 4 out of 5 stars but it is a worthy addition to the marvel universe  i liked it better than black panther but not as well as captain america or iron man  for all those calling this a feminist movie  thats a bunch of crp  you may not agree with brie larsons politics and i dont but i probably wouldnt see many movies if i only attended movies where i agreed with the main actors politics  i stay away from movies with overtly racist or leftist messages this isnt one of those  i saw it the day it came out and then again two days later  i enjoyed it
Mar 16 2019,positive,as someone who has been waitiing for this movie to be released for a while now i wasnâtmt disappointed i enjoyed the movie all the way till the end first i want to point out the cgi in this film it was phenomenal when i first go to see how the skrulls shapeshifted i was taken aback at how unique it was portrayed also not to mention the deaging one samuel l jackson was so good that i thought i was watching pulp fiction again minus the afro i also thought the costumes and makeup was wonderful and adequate for the time period the acting was exceptional i loved the chemistry between brie and her costars one of my favorite parts of the movie was what carol and maria had together and honestly i half expected them be more than friends the comedy wasnâtmt the type that makes you feel like your going to pee yourself from laughing so hard but more of a comedy to make you chuckle or a harsh breathe of air out of your nose this isnâtmt a good or bad thing it just depends on what you like good score very different from the typical marvel movie the only qualms i have are that i wish that there was a longer climax fight sequence in conclusion i believe that this movie is worth a watch and go into it with and open mind
Mar 16 2019,negative,dry and plain i mean honestly col furys lost his eye because of a cat alien really
Mar 16 2019,negative,i normally love superhero movies but this one just didnt do it for me dialog was very flat barely any humor main character did not have a connection with audience etc was just meh
Mar 16 2019,positive,fun and funny movie sets the stage well for endgame
Mar 16 2019,positive,it was a solid movie but i wasnt wowed but it it was good origin story but i think it tried to follow the same formula for most marvel origin movies at times the humor and lightness seemed forced i loved the homage to stan i think what annoyed me at times was the musical classical scores in the background the seemed to heavy at times its still a fun movie to watch and definitely makes me want to see more captain marvel but they now need to take it up another notch 
Mar 16 2019,negative,i really thought it was just meh i felt as if the acting really was lacking especially from the main female lead
Mar 16 2019,positive,im not a big fan of the leading actress but i must humbly admit that i liked the movie from beginning to end interesting backstory and lots of complex information to digest    looking forward 2 the final chapter in the avengers series
Mar 16 2019,negative,so am i allowed to give low review on this crapfest
Mar 16 2019,negative,very bland i expected more
Mar 16 2019,negative,honestly no action and no actual threat to cm this is the first movie iâtmm seriously upset i wasted money on tickets for this demotivated me for endgame most boring movie iâtmve seen in years
Mar 16 2019,positive,loved it  one of their best movies in the marvel universe
Mar 16 2019,negative,if not for iron man 3 and guardians of the galaxy 2 this would be the worst mcu movie ever made larsons walk through of her lines the flat and very not funny one liners are only a few of the issues with this movie my son and wife were so bored they took naps during the slower moving portions of the movie i must say they were long naps the action scenes served no purpose and the dramatic moments were lackluster at best i wanted this movie to be good i enjoyed all versions of captain marvel comics but i can say this movie will not be added to my collection of mcu blurays disney has assumed the audience will flock to the movie regardless of the quality dont be fooled this movie is at best a good in flight presentation as you fly across the country on jet blue
Mar 16 2019,positive,great film one of the best marvel films yet brie larson does an amazing job and has chemistry with just about everyone on screen good twists and turns to those giving a bad review grow up and actually see the film its well done
Mar 16 2019,positive,very solid superhero movie however i understand why people are becoming tired of superhero movies  the tropes are slightly overdone but i liked it a lot anyway
Mar 16 2019,positive,i loved it the young looking samuel l jackson stole the show but i would by lying if i said i didnt love brie larsons captain marvel great tale that flips a few times before the end solidly enriches the marvel universe
Mar 16 2019,negative,not the best from marvel
Mar 16 2019,positive,funny how a movie this good with record pre sale numbers only had 34 of people wanting to see it i came in knowing people took their time to lie about the quality of this movie i never done a review before or even had an account i seen the movie 3 times and loved it this is the best marvel origin movie since gotg i dont count black panther or sm homecoming because they were in civil war
Mar 16 2019,negative,lazy writing and over the top cliches created mcu plot holes and seemingly does not care never wanna watch a movie and go âwtf is happeningâ at nearly every scene pacing is wacky and fails to make me feel invested in the movie at all
Mar 16 2019,positive,very fun movie more than anything it gets me excited to see more of larsons captain marvel in the mcu it wasnt a perfect film but it gets a max rating from me dont buy into the trolling
Mar 16 2019,negative,worst marvel movie by far total lack of humor unlike other marvel movies the leading actress was poorly cast the story line was not interesting i hope captain marvel is not a big part of end game
Mar 16 2019,positive,exception made for a few more convential scenes this was a very touching and big surprise the rythme of the movie is smooth kept me hooked and is different from the usual super hero movie even tho im a fan of marvel one of their many faults to me was them being unable to actually make us feel with the character and not just feel for them they nailed it there the moral of the story i thought very refreshing especially for the super hero genre they played well with fans expectation and knowledge and personally kept me on my toes applauding also amazing performances from the cast all around a great time and an very well done introduction to a new character 
Mar 16 2019,negative,very disappointing not worth the admission price
Mar 16 2019,neutral,as a old guy i liked all the easter eggs it was an ok movie as for where it ranks with other marvel films more towards the bottom  plot was ok action and gotcha moments ok not great
Mar 16 2019,negative,brie larson yet again phoning it in terrible writing stupid script and another generic superhero movie from marvel could have been way better 055
Mar 16 2019,negative,this was probably the worst marvel movie i have watched  i was so bored and her acting was bad  the plot was weird and kind of pointless  2nd review because i dont know what happened to my 1st one
Mar 16 2019,negative,subpar acting from larson shes a good actor but wasnt fit for this part
Mar 16 2019,positive,after so many negative facebook reviews i went in with low expectations however this movie was one of the best marvel movies of all time i loved the action the humor and the positive and encouraging message it sent for young girls such a great movie
Mar 16 2019,negative,good not great same as 1st captain america brie larson was a bard choice everything else was good
Mar 16 2019,positive,a really fun ride not my favorite mcu movie but certainly in my top 5 i loved captain marvels snarkiness she was hilarious in a really understated way  i thought the relationship between her and fury was awesome also loved the relationship with rambo     the star of the show was goose so many of my problems could be solved if i had goose for a companion     ive seen captain marvel twice i will see it again a couple of times and will absolutely buy it on digital
Mar 16 2019,negative,extremely sexist also gave the air force and air force academy a bad image
Mar 16 2019,negative,follows a very bad formula the cat and nick fury were by far the best part of the movie
Mar 16 2019,positive,a powerful visually stunning film demonstrating the perils of blindly believing in ones infallible morality i left the theater feeling inspired and proud to be a woman despite the row of men behind me bad mouthing the film men  this film is not for you
Mar 16 2019,negative,for just a âmovieâtm itâtms not to bad but for a marvel movie it is probably one of their worst movies theyâtmve made
Mar 16 2019,negative,it had potential but failed to execute  middleton is the only actor worth mentioning  boring predictable  the end fight sence please  more average dreck that cares more about propaganda than good story telling  not all marvel movies are good  this is down there with thor 2 ironman 2 and 3
Mar 16 2019,positive,not the greatest mcu movie but very far from the worst  a well executed movie but nothing special that makes it stand out still entertaining nevertheless
Mar 16 2019,neutral,was not all that it was worked up to be to be honest very full when it came to the fighting
Mar 16 2019,negative,story was really bad felt like only one big act with captain marvel just running around while essentially invincible the pacing was terrible i think the acting was fine but the movie in general was bad
Mar 16 2019,negative,at this point we as fans have a very high standards from the mcu itâtms hard to go into a movie and try to tell yourself it is a good movie when really it is not captain marvel herself does not bring enough character and emotion to the story i went into the movie hoping that it would be another hit for marvel but unfortunately this might be their first flop she captain marvel started off the movie being arrogant and cocky and she ended the movie bing arrogant and cocky no character growth no consequences no emotion just filler
Mar 16 2019,positive,a fantastic addition to the world of marvel great to see a strong independent woman in the titular role actually done right
Mar 16 2019,negative,this movie was really b a d it was boring from beginning to end the actress was acting all standoffish to the point i really couldnt care about the character she was playing i cared a lot more about the supporting cast than the main gal the fight scenes where not memorable either i wish i could get my money back this is not a troll the movie really was bad and boring and even if its an origins movie because captain america origin wasnt boring iron man origin wasnt boring guardians of the galaxy origin wasnt boring captain marvel  boring boring boooooriiiiing
Mar 16 2019,negative,i love marvel movies and have watched many of them multiple times per day when they are released to bluray  i wanted to like this movie i honestly did but there is just so much missing and what is there is completely predictable     i believe disney waited to release this movie a month before endgame comes out because they knew it was going to be bad  i think they were counting on the hype of people getting excited for the final movie  they knew everyone would buy tickets to this one because she is in endgame  not seeing it would be like skipping the next to the last chapter in a book just going to the final one instead   they knew we all would want to know who she is and what her powers are      this is my least favorite marvel movie i have seen  but this is one that you really cannot wait for the bluray release because you need to know what she is about before endgame premieres  well played disney well played you snuck in the absolute worst movie before the finale knowing we would have no choice but to pay for it
Mar 16 2019,negative,politics aside slowest action movie ever
Mar 16 2019,negative,bad plot bad actor bad virtue signaling donâtmt waste your money
Mar 16 2019,negative,the movie had potential but the script and development of characters were very under marvel standart political themes just mess up also
Mar 16 2019,negative,wanted to love it but its painfully boring and uninspired
Mar 16 2019,positive,loved it cant wait to see her again in avengers endgame
Mar 16 2019,neutral,alita battle angle and wonder woman are better if your even slightly torn spend your money on alita battle angle while its still in theaters 
Mar 16 2019,negative,bad movie bad historybad villian
Mar 16 2019,negative,had high expectations i always marvel movies in theatre should have waited for the pirated version  has bright spots but overall underwhelming the cat is the most interesting character in he whole film   should have named it captain purry   i recommend you wait for the pirated version save your hard earned cash for the end game cuzzzz its gonna be epic  i hope aaladin does not disappoint like this shit marketing gimmick did
Mar 16 2019,positive,was expecting this horrendous preachy sjw experience from all the reviews in read  so i was not expecting much it is however a fun movie and entertaining certainly not the best of the marvel movies but not a âbadâ movie by any means a good start to introduce her for the next avengers movie
Mar 16 2019,positive,this movie was pretty good  some of the characters really shine through like the enemy general  there were some hints of social activism being pushed in the movie  the story was pretty typical but had a bit of a twist on it that you can pick up on pretty quickly     the short  all in all pretty well made standard marvel movie with a couple great supporting roles and cool moments but i wouldnt consider it a great movie or anything new    looking forward to end game
Mar 16 2019,positive,great screenplay great 90s soundtrack very funny and pure joy go and watch
Mar 16 2019,positive,captain marvel a highly anticipated movie put in the spot light after infinity war ending credit scene showing nick furry dropping his pager displaying captain marvels logo this more than likely put in the viewers head that captain marvel would probably be the answer to marvel universeâtms villan thanos a lot of hype and political intertwining brought the movies reputation down as most people jumped on the âme tooâtm wagon to give the movie an average rating the movie is exactly what i expected and is another great piece of the larger collection of stories brought to audiences by marvel before judging what other people say watch the movie yourself and draw your own conclusion i recommend this movie and would see again
Mar 16 2019,negative,its not a good marvel movie but samuel l jackson its excellent
Mar 16 2019,negative,slow movie overall lead character isnt what marvel represents
Mar 16 2019,positive,great superhero origin story with loads of everything including awesome action character building plot twists and relevance for todays society without being preaching or clichã c ranks among the best mcu films to date
Mar 16 2019,positive,iâtmm a big fan of the mcu but wasnâtmt really impressed with the trailers so glad i took my daughter to watch it opening weekend in spite of the early negative reviews it was remarkably well done and while it has a different âfeelâ than other movies was a great set up for what comes next
Mar 16 2019,negative,captain marvel herself lacks many of the admirable virtues of other superheroes or atleast fails to show you that she has admirable traits outside of stubborn arrogance
Mar 16 2019,positive,i thought this film was captivating as a story it challenges your perspective and reminds us to not always take things at face value and i loved that moreover this film is empowering disregard sexgenderidentity politics the message of this film is a human one it makes you remember how tenacious and tough we can all be in the face of adversity an enthralling an empowering hopeful message an exciting and welcome addition to the mcu cant wait for endgame
Mar 16 2019,negative,this was a pretty whatever film should have been better and should have come out a year and a half ago dont care for brie larsen very much would have preferred a black widow or scarlet witch film
Mar 16 2019,positive,might not have been a âperfectâ marvel movie but was easy to relate to as a woman  wish i would have had some of the built in messaging when i was younger  funny strong female characters a nod to missing links in previous movies love that the avengers name was inspired here plot twist was welcome  samuel carried the comedy  highly entertaining
Mar 16 2019,positive,as far as superhero origin movies go this doesnt do so much to break the formula that being said this surpassed my expectations based on how fun it was ben mendelsohn and samuel l jackson deliver excellent performances and having been unsure about her ability to play one of marvels lead characters heading into phase 4 brie larson delivered as the titular character 
Mar 16 2019,positive,my son and i enjoyed the movie it was interesting funny really made so many things clear and i had tears in my eyes when i saw marvel studios opening theme 
Mar 16 2019,positive,really enjoyed this  as did my family
Mar 16 2019,positive,i really liked this movie i thought it was good addition to the mcu i really dont get all the hate
Mar 16 2019,negative,bad writting bad cgi terrible actress
Mar 16 2019,positive,im not sure why theres so much hate for this film i try to keep politics and hollywood separate as it tends to ruin the thing i love most so going in i had no illwill towards the film is it about female empowerment yes and sometimes i wish they would have just focused on the story instead of making sure we knew that i felt it was a good film throughout but the epic finale sold me this science fiction mystery is enhanced by some beautiful imagery i loved the 90s setting and young fury stole the show at times above all i felt the sometimes convoluted story worked the soundtrack was great the comedy was onpoint and brie larson made for a perfect captain marvel this might be in my top 5 mcu films and thats high praise ignore the outside noise and give it a chance
Mar 16 2019,negative,the story was so poorly written its almost like they never learned how to build up a good story arch and its like they didnt even try to make her relatable or have any humanity what so ever i want my money and time back
Mar 16 2019,neutral,this was a below average marvel movie nothing spectacular about it i went to go see it with my friend carlos and it was more fun making fun of the movie than it was watching it it just seemed bland and incoherent and for lack of a better word it was just a mess almost rushing through itself like the pacing of this movie sucked so bad and we dont really have any gravity of carols situation i often find myself asking why should we care and the ending plot twist was actually very predictable the acting in the movie was fine sam jackson played a great part ben mendelsohn same the rest were just meh story was weak weird and paced terribly special effects were atrocious to look at it looked like an actual 90s movie the editing dear god almighty the editing was so bad like actually so bad look at hitop films to explain why i just cant do it justice it was actually so bad i had to close my eyes because the cringe was so bad and when she was fighting in the end to the tune of im just a girl this attempted james gunn impression with the retro song fight fell hard on its face it was juat terrible this movie overall was okay not the best and i certaintly will not be watching this again
Mar 16 2019,positive,the movie made other superheroes feel less âsuperâ but the story behind this movie is great getting to know a little more about nick and other i loved it the time jumps in this movie were well executed in my opinion would definitely recommend if you donâtmt mind seeing thinking about captain america as a superhero weaker than a cat 
Mar 16 2019,negative,is this really the first thing that continues stan lees legacy after his death do we really need his supervision this movie was crap bad screenwrtiting and an actress that should be recast this movie would be okay for a b ranked film but not for a marvel film and especially after infinity war
Mar 16 2019,negative,one of the worst movies marvel had made a weak plot pointless villains and the ruined one of the biggest buildups ever and made a movie that coasts by on 90s nostalgia the only reason to watch this movie is for the stan lee camio and the stan lee intro after the camio try to go and get a refund
Mar 16 2019,negative,bland boring nothing new to see here
Mar 16 2019,positive,i loved this movie so much especially after i made it past the one hour mark  it was so interesting and compelling  i would highly recommend it
Mar 16 2019,negative,boring movie i could not watch it completely
Mar 16 2019,negative,worst marvel movie so far
Mar 16 2019,positive,all around marvel magic
Mar 16 2019,negative,decent film but really lackluster im a huge marvel fan and i normally go to see their films two or three times in theaters but i honestly left this one feeling a bit let down its a decent film just not on par with the other marvel movies weve come to know and love seeing the easter eggs to other movies was a nice touch and i still recommend watching it but dont waste money on the theater wait to see it once its out to stream
Mar 16 2019,positive,very good family film
Mar 16 2019,negative,im not sure what was worse having to look at her alien monkey feet at the start of the movie or her acting
Mar 16 2019,positive,brie larson was almost as good as samuel jacksons makeup loved it
Mar 16 2019,negative,wait to rent it     best description here i was bored watching captain marvel for a while i thought it was because this particular marvel movie wasnâtmt meant for me the spiritually inclined had already had their outing with dr strange the same way dadless dudebros had theirs with guardians of the galaxy or idealistic patriots had theirs with captain america or unsure youngâtmuns had theirs with spiderman or chris hemsworth fans had theirs with thor etc maybe captain marvel was for women â in particular women who had been told all their lives that being a woman meant they werenâtmt good enough werenâtmt strong enough werenâtmt fast enough etc â and so its journey of selfdiscovery through selfrecovery was not designed executed and polished to a high sheen for my particular benefit
Mar 16 2019,positive,it is one of the worst movies in the mcu some of the jokes was really good and samuel l jackson brings a very good mood into the movie beside that the story is flat considering that brie larson is an oscar winning actress this is then her worst acting ever i have seen an actor who is playing a superhero and not the character itself  i think steven seagal would have shown much more emotions on his face than brie larson did in this movie we get angry carol denvers and angry carol denvers aaand  this movie is the equivalent of thor  the dark world
Mar 16 2019,negative,80 of the movie is on earth with low effects  skrulls sound silly with an australian accent  why does the thing blowing up give carol powers  even if it did why would it be that much power since the explosion wasnt strong enough to even kill two people  the cat thing was stupid  the cat causing furys eye thing was way stupid  worst marvel movie yet  in my opinion the only bad one  not that they were all great or made a lot of sense but the others were also much more fun
Mar 16 2019,negative,not offensively bad by any means but the epitome of mediocrity i would place it below ant man and on par with original thor
Mar 16 2019,negative,horrible waste of time
Mar 16 2019,positive,good addition to the mcu fits about midway in terms of how it rates to the rest look forward to seeing what happens in endgame
Mar 16 2019,neutral,the first half of the movie was awful and then samuel jackson and goose the cat got more screen time at which point the movie actually became entertaining
Mar 16 2019,neutral,the movie creates plot holes in the marvel universe and the acting by the lead character was flat without emotion
Mar 16 2019,positive,it was really fun but just average in the mcu
Mar 16 2019,negative,pathetic boring movie special effects not so good plot is very common and uninspiring
Mar 16 2019,negative,first what did i like the effects were good as i would expect with marvel samuel jackson actually looked younger and it was convincing unfortunately effects do not make a movie i thought the performance from larson was very unengaging and made it difficult to generate interest in her character there is no character arc or development for her that makes you want to root for her the humor in the film didnt really resonate and the soundtrack was only mediocre oh and nick furys eye  really
Mar 16 2019,negative,this film is a pure disappointment
Mar 16 2019,positive,visually stunning funny and full of heart captain marvel continues marvelâtms long winning streak
Mar 16 2019,negative,worst marvel movie ive ever seen no connection with previous avengers movies or mcu with a lots of potholes and bs agenda
Mar 16 2019,negative,just lazy and mediocre
Mar 16 2019,positive,it was nice movie with answer alot of questions in mcu
Mar 16 2019,neutral,okay enjoyable simple story but kinda formulaic simple villains and somewhat loose writing
Mar 16 2019,positive,great movie wasnâtmt all based aroumd having a leading female antagonist and how powerful she is and the movie flowed really well together if you havenâtmt seen the movie already i recommend that you do
Mar 16 2019,negative,im done with marvel movies i want to see an original story with development of real characters and not being told how to think
Mar 16 2019,positive,super movie a like one of the best in the mcu
Mar 16 2019,negative,capatainmehvel couldnt be saved by all the marvelite critics and fans  it was very boring and predictable   felt like it was themarvel version of greenlantern movie of 2011  didnt feel inspired what so ever   notgamechanger in my honest opinion  dont waste youre money just wait for it on netflix  dontfallforthehype dontbeasheep
Mar 16 2019,negative,generally very slow movie fury was good dialogue was very forced the plot was fairly confusing with who the good guys are one of my least favourite marvel films
Mar 16 2019,negative,waste if time and super confusing at times shes just ironman with natural power that she got out of nowhere no way she defeats thanos
Mar 16 2019,negative,lame lackluster shameful action predictable   politics aside just a terrible film mcus worst
Mar 16 2019,positive,i enjoyed the movie at least now we have a genuine female hero in the marvel universe
Mar 16 2019,negative,this movie follows a very simple story that is more cookie cutter than original  brie larson has some great scenes  however it is overshadowed by the poor plot and the tropes that are smeared throughout  still worth seeing but this movie is just hype for avengers endgame totally the reason why i went  overall enjoyed the movie as it is a typical popcorn movie  that does not make the viewer think at all  goose the cat did overshadow bries acting at times  which was a great at times
Mar 16 2019,positive,not the best movie but was fun
Mar 16 2019,positive,this movie is amazing
Mar 16 2019,negative,has to be one of the most boring and dull movies i watchd in recent years by far the weakest of all the marvel movies
Mar 16 2019,negative,personally i was so excited for this movie but it waskinda lame im truly disappointed
Mar 16 2019,negative,another example of poorly pushing agendas on people by destroying another great movie series
Mar 16 2019,positive,i really enjoyed it i was happily surprised by the interesting plot and beautiful cinematography have always liked larson so a bit biased in my love for her as carol it had good funny moments and some beautiful moving moments i think the most common critique ive seen so far is nolittle character development and i technically agree but i dont think thats a detriment the film honestly doesnt hinge on some deep character change but rather characterreacquaintance it works both as a great origin story and connectiontie into the marvel expanded universe definitely a recommend if you like marvel and the fun in superhero movies
Mar 16 2019,positive,not the best marvel movie by any means but i feel that due to  bries comments people have down voted  i feel thats a bit sad
Mar 16 2019,negative,worst movie of the marvel universe
Mar 16 2019,positive,another great marvel movie
Mar 16 2019,positive,captain marvel is the 21st movie of the marvel cinematic universe it starred brie larson as carol danversverscaptain marvel samuel l jackson as nick fury jude law as yonrogg and more casts   the story started in 1995 on the kree empires capital planet of hala vers had nightmares to be honest it wasnt a good beginning but it wasnt forgettable next scenes were quite forgettable because they showed nothing special so i couldnt remember much of it i could remember when she met fury with 2 agents at the blockbuster video shop wasnt it i cant remember when she was captured by talos and other skrulls we were fooled by the movie we though the skrulls were villains they tried to change vers memory surely that could be remembered by most people i think the others scene till the end of the movie was not bad but a few people could remember many the story plot was not bad at all started in a planet a young woman trying to find out who she was and took a lot of risks to restore her memory surely audiences from the 90s would like that but for me it was medium like a 7510 bet the 90s would like it more than i do   brie larson was set to be the main character in this movie but unfortunately she didnt try her best to prove that carol danvers or vers was main in here i know she could do a lot better like in room 2015 she won best actress but in here the mcu didnt take this movie seriously enough to make carol the main character however they did some marvelous cgi effects of vers powers and others they were quite like real with no mistakes the final battle was thrilling full with power beams and other cgi nothing was bad and i was actually impressed the right thing they did was to add humor to the movie luckily there was samuel l jackson so things went okay also with goose the cat even though there were hilarious scenes i laughed a little and i think they should do more while watching the movie i was bored for some time like in conversations for example they were really boring but to make things impressive they did a lot better at the end even though the fight scenes werent that epic   so to summarize this i would like to say that captain marvel 2019 isnt one of the greatest of the marvel cinematic universe but it was funny entertaining at the end but i bet the audiences of the 21st century wouldnt like it sorry larson the movie was fine but you didnt try your best in here
Mar 16 2019,negative,dull acting performance and script writing the scrolls plot point was under utilized action scenes are one sided and boring generally a bad boring movie
Mar 16 2019,negative,problematic story and acting no flow or  character investment
Mar 16 2019,negative,great job by ben mendelsohn and goose but otherwise bland and uninspired
Mar 16 2019,negative,it is infuriating the treatment of the skrulls in this movie keep politics out of movies people go to escape politics not to be virtue signaled to by hollywood elitists
Mar 16 2019,positive,i loved the fight sequences the soundtrack and the humor they did a great job deaging samuel l jackson and clark gregg    in the end i merely liked the conclusion of her origin store but i didnt love it i felt there were some gaps that im not satisfied with    overall i highly enjoyed this movie
Mar 16 2019,positive,this movie was hilarious
Mar 16 2019,positive,its fun to see how captain marvel came to be the cast is funny the story was great deaged samuel l jackson was amazing and who doesnt love goose the cat
Mar 16 2019,positive,in the top 3 marvel movies for me
Mar 16 2019,negative,worst move in the mcu not recommend and not because she is a women it just bad
Mar 16 2019,positive,another good marvel movie the dramatic and emotional parts felt a little forced and brie larson isnt the strongest actress but it worked great action scenes and graphics
Mar 16 2019,neutral,captain marvel had lots of action and skillful graphics the actors were very good however something was just not there the plot was too complicated and heavy there was too much backstory to follow it moved along too slowly i never really cared about the characters it just didnt work for me
Mar 16 2019,negative,looked more like anime than an actual movielol
Mar 16 2019,positive,brie larson almost perfectly captures the essence of carol danvers straight out of the comics the performances are solid but the writing isnt the best and the pacing feels a little weird at points it is however a very refreshing touch for a female superhero to fully realize her strength on her own without the help of or for the sake of a man a message that is quite opposite of dcs wonder woman overall it definitely isnt a top entry from marvel but its a good movie
Mar 16 2019,neutral,lack of adequate setup results in empty payoffs and an emotionally flat film this combined with poorly executed action sequences left me overall dissatisfied
Mar 16 2019,positive,its all about the cat 
Mar 16 2019,positive,i loved this movie great action soundtrack and story
Mar 16 2019,positive,good movie donâtmt now why so many negative reviews brie larson kicks ass
Mar 16 2019,positive,thats wery not bad film 
Mar 16 2019,neutral,it was ok felt like a last ditch effort to create an origin story so they could include her in avengers honestly having an invincible superhero loses its charm thor was borderline too much if a hero is invincible there really is never a threat i think avengers is better off without her 
Mar 16 2019,negative,terrible movie  sad really the marvel brand usually at least  gets you your moneyâtms worth i was so disappointed after leaving this one i demanded a refund at the ticket booth  of course the 16 year old kid looked at me like i was crazy but i was serious anyway donâtmt waste your money folks really the hype is real the movie is garbage this website is deleting negative reviews calling it trolls i truly wonder if theyâtmve seen this garbage
Mar 16 2019,neutral,lacked character development captain marvel is supposed to be the strongest character in the mcu but it wasnt portrayed to be so it was just an okay movie not a marvel movie that normally blows you away
Mar 16 2019,negative,the movie destroys 10 years of building up of the mcu its hard to accept the conection with the other movies and the political tone is clear    nick fury looks more like a clown then the real nick fury from the other movies it is as if shield was some normal agency who gain new purpose after meeting the new op hero    this movie is terrible in so many ways that is hard to describe
Mar 16 2019,negative,horrible marvel movie
Mar 16 2019,negative,the acting was bad the story was not good overall a disappointment honestly it seemed rushed and not on par with the other marvel movies more like a madefortv movie and if so i would have changed the channel halfway through im a huge fan of marvel watched infinity war many times and hope that this is not an indicator for the direction that avengers endgame will take 
Mar 16 2019,positive,i really liked the movie the characters were likable and well written i disliked how they took it completely over the top with her powers in the last part but that had to be expected all in all a good movie
Mar 16 2019,negative,you throw it in the top 3 worst marvel movies yet it was so bland mostly predictable and disgustingly cliche i regret paying for this garbage
Mar 16 2019,positive,i enjoyed the movie special effects were great interesting character
Mar 16 2019,positive,i enjoyed it  they could have avoided the difficulty of trying to make fury and coulson younger by writing a less dated back story but that was the only awkward part for me  i loved the talos character and it was cool to see a more explored kreeskrull war in mcu    of course goose steals theshow  yeah the show     i wish we had had this movie earlier in the marvel movie rollout because it feels like there is a lot more story between this one and her reappearance    it does help set the stage for avengers endgame and iâtmll be interested to see what a more mature captain marvel brings to the table
Mar 16 2019,negative,run of the mill story and the usual cgi fest  walked out after an hour
Mar 16 2019,negative,irrelevant not fun a political propaganda and will flunk
Mar 16 2019,positive,solid flick much better than some origin stories 
Mar 16 2019,negative,very disappointing tbh was hoping for better  felt no connection or empathy for cm unfortunately she may be better in a team movie so looking forward to she her in endgame 
Mar 16 2019,negative,bad acting bad script bad humor
Mar 16 2019,negative,lacked the energy that marvel has come to be known for wonderful supporting characters that make the movie somewhat worth seeing however brie larsons captain marvel seems uncharacteristically thoughtless and dry for such an amazing actress hopefully the russos can fix marvel in endgame and let both brie and the mcu shine again 
Mar 16 2019,positive,saw captain marvel with three generations of family and all thought it was great planning to go see it again
Mar 16 2019,positive,a fantastic journey and a great heroine
Mar 16 2019,positive,i am surprised by all the negative opinions the movie is great i think that brie larson plays captain marvel very good and i had a good laugh as well there is a lot of action and i enjoyed the storyline the audience loved it as well 
Mar 16 2019,negative,uninspired film all around brie larson delivers a lazy performance for a weak and unrelatable charater the plot is predictable jokes do not land at all special effects belong to a 2000s video game this is by far the worst mcu film
Mar 16 2019,positive,i liked the music in capt marvel it brought me back to my teenage years  not too bad looking forward to endgame
Mar 16 2019,negative,had to watch it for the sake of the mcu  but wasnâtmt worth it 
Mar 16 2019,positive,marvellous itâtms true the most powerful being in the universe is woman
Mar 16 2019,negative,disappointing  poor acting from leading lady
Mar 16 2019,positive,i love the movie good but kick and great action and brie larson at her bast 
Mar 16 2019,positive,cant wait to add to my collection awesome movie
Mar 16 2019,positive,so good  whoever says it is bad is bad himself
Mar 16 2019,negative,movie was wrong in so many ways
Mar 16 2019,negative,talk about a letdown of batman vs superman proportions you completely erased captain marvell having any powers and made it so she got her powers from standing too close to an exploding engines also captain marvel is so sarcastic it becomes unbearable i thought captain america was the first avenger per the title of his movie i guess hes just the firstborn avenger
Mar 16 2019,positive,ok i know all those weekkneed misogynist mommas boys got their fragile egos all in a bind inundated this feed with bad ratings before the movie even came out yet i have a different unpopular opinion i liked it more than wonder woman which i liked a lot   i found the feminist message in cm much more compellingplus i thought the story had more emotional resonance and i loved the fact that there was not even a hint of romance unlike ww  the big penultimate action setpiece was disappointing but that was the only part of the movie that i didnt care for
Mar 16 2019,positive,had a blast watching captain marvel entertaining funny fastpaced anyone trolling here saying brie larsons performance was onenote and boring clearing didnt get it she was strong and witty and badass my daughter kept yelling i am powerful like captain marvel yes my girl you are go see it a worthy addition to the marvel cannon 
Mar 16 2019,neutral,movie was k nothing grate but k   samuel jackson was gr8  brie larson k  an avarage movie  nothing compare to wonder women  cant wait for real captain marvel 
Mar 16 2019,positive,all i can tell you is the story was so slow mid way in the movie that i actually nodded off twice movie was palatable but nothing remarkable overall meh
Mar 16 2019,negative,such a poor entry in the mcu a poor performance from the lead actress makes it hard to enjoy this film where credit is due i will praise the amazing work done deaging samuel l jackson there are too many plot holes and inconsistencies in this film for my liking wouldnt really say this film is a good role model for young girls and the film and its marketing seem to busy reminding the audience that shes a woman in reality this just comes across as forced and preachy wonder woman did a much better job of portraying a strong female superhero without the forced female talking points
Mar 16 2019,negative,changed too much marvell is female this is like making hank pym a female and not the original antman
Mar 16 2019,negative,worst marvel movie i saw in a long time not a bad movie just a bad marvel movie completely boring in comparison to other marvel movies
Mar 16 2019,positive,solid flick dont pay attention to the currently 62 rating from viewers this movie has been getting troll bombed by a lot of fragile egos who havent even seen the movie 
Mar 16 2019,positive,great fun film for the family it has the prequel build like captain america the first avenger i think this movie is a good setup for the next phase of marvel films
Mar 16 2019,positive,amazing entertaining motivating movie with finally a female bad ass superhero
Mar 16 2019,positive,great movie and great acting thank you very much brie larson
Mar 16 2019,negative,i honestly went into the movie ignoring the poor reviews but some of them were true captain marvel is a very one dimensional character i found it to be dull and damages a powerful character from the comics the acting by her was poor too as it seemed she only had one emotion the entire film i do hope in she is not a focal point of endgame 
Mar 16 2019,negative,this is the worst mcu movie so far it tried way to hard to be wonder woman it forced jokes and was very sloppy major disappointment save your money read up on her powers and watch the after credits scenes there are 2 of them 
Mar 16 2019,negative,marvel movies are something a greatly look forward to and this one did not fail to disappoint very lackluster and completely skippable i was not invested in any of the characters and the plot was entirely predictable heres hoping this one is just a fluke
Mar 16 2019,positive,solid movie that quietly answered some questions about the mcu universe but also raised a few questions as well its a solid story that has some funny moments the intensity wasnt there 
Mar 16 2019,neutral,soso flawed in many respects  competent in others bottomtier marvel movie but probably not the worst 
Mar 16 2019,negative,not terrible but also not a good movie   some of the worst dialogue and most hamfisted elements i enjoyed about a 3rd of the film but cannot overlook the feeling of embarrassment i felt merely watching some scenes truly terrible writing
Mar 16 2019,negative,this is a passable superhero film loaded with beautiful visuals and some great performances but due to its weak writing mixed tone and lack of depth in its lead the film fails to go above and beyond a surfacelevel actionsuperhero film leaning heavily on marvel cliches and humour but enjoyable nonetheless its the mcus rogue one  unfortunately sharing most of its positives negatives and one ben mendelsohn
Mar 16 2019,positive,liked it a lot even though the first half was a bit confusing the latter was intense loved it
Mar 16 2019,negative,never have i seen a film pander so much please stop using marvel comics to push your sjw propaganda agenda
Mar 16 2019,negative,bottom 2 of the of the marvel franchise movie only one worst then this was guardians vol 2 i gave it an extra half star because of the cat it single handedly saved the movie
Mar 16 2019,positive,beyond anything ever presented to us in the marvel universe
Mar 16 2019,positive,very good movie much better than i expected and goosegoose was amazing
Mar 16 2019,positive,amazing from start to finish this movie has it all fantastic dialogue great twists and turns hilarious excellent character build a wonderful story this is a must seei cannot wait for the sequels of captain marvel
Mar 16 2019,negative,boring and capitan marvel isnt likable 
Mar 16 2019,positive,does not slot into my top 5 but still a good movie
Mar 16 2019,positive,really good film thought they did an excellent job on bire larson character showed a really good balance of her character development thought the film never got bored during the film there was an excellent supporting cast top job marvel  bire larson looking forward to endgame and a captain marcel 2
Mar 16 2019,negative,the only thing good about this movie is the suit
Mar 16 2019,negative,by far the worst film in the mcu terrible
Mar 16 2019,negative,good visuals but uninteresting and an empty movie
Mar 16 2019,positive,good fun movie with a good combo of light humour serious acting and comic book references  was more enjoyable then i was expecting
Mar 16 2019,positive,amazing movie action packed loved the witty humor movie references and brie larsons character
Mar 16 2019,positive,hardly groundbreaking but a very good effort considering the marvel superhero genre is a road well travelled as a marvel origins story it ticks all the boxes well paced it resists the temptation to outdo itâtms predecessors sets up for endgame very nicely
Mar 16 2019,positive,not bad good performances but feels like its just a setup for endgames
Mar 16 2019,negative,the mcu is over its zenith this sorry effort proves it
Mar 16 2019,positive,cant understand why the audience ratings arent higher as this is one of the best marvel comics movies in recent history the characters  even the villains  are welldefined and multidimensional the story engaging and humorous and it even manages to tug at the heartstrings a few times as they say fun for the whole family
Mar 16 2019,positive,really fun movie brie larson is awesome as captain marvel
Mar 16 2019,positive,fantastic movie marvel did an excellent job of tying older films together the vintage 80s theme was a nice touch as well
Mar 16 2019,positive,captain marvel is a mixed bag of a film the opening half of the film is perhaps the least interesting part and is essentially a cgi fest much like most other recent sci fi efforts once vers as shes called arrives on earth and we meet the skrulls and a fabulously deaged samuel l jackson that things start to soar ultimately ending in a climax where you want more there are twits a plenty in this if you are familiar with the source material and this feels at times like a marvel phase one effort setting up the rest of the films nicely without seeming contrived brie larsen is good as captain marvel although you never truly warm to her in the way that you do to black panther or spiderman of special note is the tribute to the late great stan lee which is moving overall an enjoyable romp that sets up things nicely
Mar 16 2019,positive,good not great really didnt know what to expect
Mar 16 2019,negative,marvel took a l on this one i thought they could do no wrong but this movie proved that wrong bad actor bad origin story bad movie
Mar 16 2019,negative,this movie was kinda boring very by the book if this was the beginning of the mcu the big bad evil guy is boring and to be honest the movie is meh at best captain marvel the character was bland and was impossible to feel her struggle as she is super powerful from the start and never felt like she was ever in danger wonder woman was way better i expect this site to delete this cause i did not enjoy the movie and only giving my honest opinion
Mar 16 2019,negative,how not to tell a story 90 talking about nothing
Mar 16 2019,positive,it was lit i did not feel the hours running
Mar 16 2019,negative,a sub par movie to marvel standards that hardly brings anything new to the formula from a casual perspective its still a good comic book movies with special effects were used to from marvel the movie is trying a bit too with the girl power theme a thing i usually dont mind but in this case it reaches the point where the men from the movie are mean to carol including her father without any explanation at all for some reason men in this movie act like the action is taking place in the 50s not the mid 90s     but from a comic book fan point of view this movie is a complete disaster it has inconsistencies all around that cancel a lot of the statements made in the previous movie hard to say where without giving spoilers the fact that the actual original captain marvel shows up in the movie but as a minor secondary character which feels like a slap to the face for original captain marvel fans an element regarding the skrulls basically ruined the possibility of  connecting the new marvel phase with the older cast and the potential of creating a movie adaptation for one of the best marvel comics of all time secret invasion acting all in all was average but thankfully samuel l jackson showed his talent and provided the few actual comedic moments in the movie despite acting a bit nonfury even compared to previous marvel movies he was in let alone comic book fury    overall the movie is a spectacle in terms of special effect something thats become quite normal for a lot of titles even non disney financed ones but falls short on all the other aspects especially consistency between other marvel titles
Mar 16 2019,positive,just saw it the practical effects were amazing and the action centerpieces were beautiful go see it at imax its so worth it cant wait for the captain to kick thanks to the curb
Mar 16 2019,positive,i have no idea what people are talking about  ive seen captain marvel twice and i have loved it both times brie larson is awesome as the lead 
Mar 16 2019,negative,very bad movie at the level of frist two thor movies and iron man 3 it has suceed in become one of the worse marvel movies ever made and marvel movies are often not that good so its indeed quite a achievment
Mar 16 2019,positive,as someone who doesnt care about politics and just watches the movie for what it is this is a very fun film and a great addition to the mcu it has problems of course but overall its a fun ride i would recommend seeing this one better than antman and the wasp in my opinion 810 pleasantly surprised
Mar 16 2019,positive,not the best marvel movie but defiantly not the worst this movie is a perfect example of how people not liking the lead actor can lead to bad reviews a movie can be good despite peoples perception about the actors in it
Mar 16 2019,neutral,the movie is overall fun the cast was overat greatben mendelssohn is an amazing villain the problem is that captain marvel has no development whatsoever when she faces problems all she has to do is get stronger or punch harder there is no obstacle she has to work hard to overcome
Mar 16 2019,positive,i was worried about all the hate surrounding this movie but itâtms actually a very good marvel origin story with solid action and a 90âtms retro nostalgic flavor brie larson does the job and i canâtmt wait to see her kick thanos all the cast is good with of course a terrific samuel jackson and a surprising ben mendelsohn to all the anti feminist haters just get a life and be honest in your review because iâtmm sure you already hated this movie before seeing it and when you say itâtms the worst marvel ever go see one more time thor 2 please captain marvel is not the best marvel movie ever and not the worst it fits in all the good ones with delightful surprises if you pay attention to the details highly recommended
Mar 16 2019,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed this film so much that i saw it twice its a worthy addition to mcu and the perfect segway to avengers endgame well done marvel
Mar 16 2019,positive,story  810 acting  910 action  710 drama 610 movie was decent worth the watch  a good addition to the marvel franchise
Mar 16 2019,positive,great message to young girls everywhere
Mar 16 2019,positive,loved it as a man and a comic book reader and an mcu fan and a feminist objectively it was far from a perfect movie but i was entertained the whole time and it adds tons of lore the the universe to every man who takes offence with this movie because it presents a perspective on life that is different from the one you experience iâtmm sad you live such an impoverished life to the whole creative team that put this together thank you
Mar 16 2019,negative,movie was very predictable with the exception of an outofplace song during a fight scene and nick fury being turned into comic relief
Mar 16 2019,positive,maybe its not the best mcu movie but there is so many great moments in the movie and i feel like you have to work really hard to dislike it entirely goose was great and carol and fury chemistry was enjoyable to watch loved the 90s nostalgia as well
Mar 16 2019,neutral,meh its not as good as ironman 2 but not as bad as ironman 3 somewhere inbetween lots of continuity issues with previous films its like marvel hopes we forgot what happened in captain america the first avenger 
Mar 16 2019,neutral,i love marvel movies i fell asleep in this one wasnt exciting and lacked emotion 
Mar 15 2019,positive,not the best marvel movie but not bad  the story line kinda drags but picks up and ends in a bang  good movie
Mar 15 2019,positive,yes sir i liked it    that was a fun flick  interesting the audience knowing more about capts captors than she    goose is the bestest   the bff plotline worked great i cant wait to see what our little lieutenant has in store for us     i didnt think it was nearly as preachy as i had been lead to believe  i remember the 80s and 90s  if you didnt fit into the expectations of your predetermined role there were common redirects from society family friends to put you back where you should be  to stay on your own path took courage and inner strength  just the things carol used to find her true power    if you cant relate to that mayer your path fit what your society had predetermined it should be     andgod damn  love me some young fury and coulson
Mar 15 2019,positive,are you engaging movie from start to finish i felt if there was a lot of back story as well as plenty of action to keep you interested not a minute of this movie was boring at all
Mar 15 2019,positive,for once i like the changes that they made in the characters origin captain marvel is a great role model good story fun movie and amazing specials effects it is now my favorite marvel movie along with dr strange
Mar 15 2019,negative,its starts out slow and picks up later it was fun to watch sometimes would i watch it again no but thats the sams with ant man 2 and spiderman
Mar 15 2019,positive,lots of action made me laugh and was thoroughly entertaining i saw it in 3d avx
Mar 15 2019,positive,good movie wife and i thought it was entertaining and certainly worth the  i was concerned early on about the very poor reviews but now believe there was a lot of trolling from people with some misguided agenda if you like the other other marvel movies go see this one too
Mar 15 2019,neutral,movie mistake is should have avoided show dont tell
Mar 15 2019,positive,movie is shallow doesnt have a good origin story 
Mar 15 2019,positive,powerful message captain marvel was nice
Mar 15 2019,positive,middle of the road marvel movie plot is very similar to thor and thus lacks originality but it is nice to revisit a phase 1 style film in the penultimate chapter of the mcu especially as it features not only the origin of a new hero but something much larger  very empowering message that applies not only to feminism but to anyone who has survived or is currently oppressed or abused take control be what you can and dont let anyone put you down higher further faster
Mar 15 2019,positive,i wanted this to be the less sexualized wonder woman in that regard i found it to be lacking important to note however i found much of it to be enjoyable silly and a decent rendition of the marvel plus disney superhero movie formula this time it is explicitly showcasing the strength and resilience of girls   still very much confused about what jude law was doing
Mar 15 2019,negative,to be honest this movie wasnt that great you want a strong female lead wonder woman had that alita had that in spades you spend most of the movie already able knowing the truth and waiting for the lead to catch up several points in the movie is sexist towards males and the male leads are dumbed down they made fury into the idiot of the buddy cops and lts not forget the big twist which is drowning in political slug the skrulls are just innocent refugees trying to find a safe hope yet in the comics the skrulls have been mostly repeat badguys they stole powers of the f4 to make a super skrull and there was an entire comic arc called invasion where they tried to take over the planet yet in this movie there innocent humanoids that are just trying to find a safe place to live hey i got this great idea how about the people that write scripts for movies follow these simple rules 1 know the source of your script and dont destroy the known lore 2 stop shoving your political crap down peoples throats i go to a movie to be entertained this movie was insulting annoying and just down right boring but hey this is rotten tomatoes so my score doesnt count only 3 out of fire stars counts so my 5 star isnt even going to matter
Mar 15 2019,positive,i highly enjoyed this movie
Mar 15 2019,positive,it may not be the best entry in the marvel cinematic universe but captain marvel still offers what fans want in an mcu movie and i would highly recommend going to see it
Mar 15 2019,negative,this movie was a liberal puff piece that was made to try and attract a new audience this movie constantly stereotyped all human males as either useless or mysoginistic as well as trying to force a characterâtms back story it tried to establish the main character as a âbadassâ it used a villain who we the audience have only seen getting his ass handed to him instead of giving the character actual depth and inspiring young people to try to reach new heights it rushed all the development of her morals and just tried to establish the new character as an unstoppable force this movie left me and multiple others with one main question what were her powers
Mar 15 2019,negative,terrible dialogue delivery at places making potential good scenes cringe the only consolation was having nick fury and his drive as a diehard marvel fan who watches the movies on the day of release im terribly disappointed
Mar 15 2019,positive,it wasnt a great movie but it wasnt a terrible movie
Mar 15 2019,negative,plot  convoluted origin story  pacing  incoherent flashbacksâfasttravelâetc  dialogue  laughably bad  humor  flat  special effects  decent  overall experience incredibly boringâfell asleep  as an invested mcu fan i left this film not caring about captain marvel in the slightest iâtmm not excited to see this character shoehorned into the avengers finale iâtmve been anticipating for years
Mar 15 2019,negative,it was just not very good the background cast is amazing but brie larson just isnt the right person for this role
Mar 15 2019,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed captain marvel it was refreshing to see a strong female lead and i hope marvel makes more films like this in the future brie larson is perfect in the role and i look forward to seeing her reprise the character in avengers endgame and future captain marvel sequels samuel l jackson also turned in a fine performance as nick fury as usual all in all an excellent addition to the mcu marvel just keeps getting better with each new film
Mar 15 2019,positive,definitely one of the weaker marvel films many of the base concepts were good but the execution often left something to be desired the worst example being how fury received his damaged eye and how he reacts to receiving that much damage to his face notably bad portions include most of the action particularly the last battle humor not landing or people being jokeyrelaxed in tonally inappropriate moments and marvel continuously underutilizing her abilities during combat and never directly killing an enemy combatant despite being a career soldier actually nonsensical choices in and out of combat can apply to the actions of many characters throughout the film
Mar 15 2019,negative,of all the marvel movies this was my least favorite writers whiffed on the script
Mar 15 2019,negative,my review was deleted and im not even a bot i leave reviews often what the heck disney and rt i saw the cm and was really hoping for it to be success but after viewing even with all the political rants the movie projects i left the theater upset why did marvel hire two amateur directors with no hit movies to their names the script was bad the directing was horrible and brie could have been good she has won awards before but its like she showed no emotion brie larson was very condescending in the movie and i didnt feel connected to her the plot was so choppy and unorganized no character building i really hope brie larson doesnt ruin avengers end game please dont ruin the movie thats the main reason i went to see cm was to see if there was a connection to end game
Mar 15 2019,negative,i feel that they should of brought captain marvel as a surprise in endgame instead of making a fake corporate woke movie
Mar 15 2019,negative,boring movie and not worth your time  got my refund back
Mar 15 2019,negative,not as good as my family was hoping it would be didnâtmt love the main character and plot was a bit all over the place
Mar 15 2019,negative,i did not like the movie so boring
Mar 15 2019,positive,could have been better but all in all good solo female film 
Mar 15 2019,positive,fun and interesting loved some of the earlier action sequences stellar performances by sam jackson brie larson and the main antagonist only wish was for the finale action to be stronger  especially when she goes full binary and for thr plot to be a little more cohesive for a stand alone film
Mar 15 2019,positive,i loved this movie brie larson played the captain just right and samuel jackson is awesome only outdone by moose many great supporting actorscharacters
Mar 15 2019,positive,all promos tell how powerful captain marvel is so we expect an opponent that she can show her powers and when movie fails to give that she felt like a bully she should have struggled about her powers at some point or she should be stripped off them so that we watch her take them back and deserves them we didnt feel worried about her even a second we were worried about her opponents if you replace her agent maria hill and given agent coulson a little bit more screen time it would be a really nice back story for nick furry and beginning of avengers initiative this is not a most powerful hero of marvel cinematic universe solo movie
Mar 15 2019,positive,though it was pretty slow at start if you have low expectations youâtmll be surprised throughout the movie and midend if the character 
Mar 15 2019,negative,although the visual effects and cinematography was just as great as ever in mcu brie larsons captain was disappointing rather than a beacon of hope and strength larson came off as uncomfortable and restrained the comic relief was from jackson the passion was from larsons friend and larson didnâtmt really provide much at all for the viewer to connect to good movie if you donâtmt know about the comics but not good if youâtmre a marvel comic fan
Mar 15 2019,positive,the movie is fun and i am glad capt will be in the next avengers movie
Mar 15 2019,positive,this was an awesome movie and iâtmm looking forward to seeing it again and owning it when it is released on dvd
Mar 15 2019,positive,not amazing but not terrible
Mar 15 2019,negative,this movie is more of a meh  the plot is poor brie larsons acting is stale an the blatant feminism throughout this movie is annoying  but this movie also has many upsides and im not so stupid that i dont see that  my main issue with this movie is just the plot  the whole plot can be described as and she wins  there is no scene of her failing  she always wins  whenever she gets slightly winded she just gets super powerful and discovers she can fly  stupid plot meh movie
Mar 15 2019,neutral,overall an ok movie over hyped was a little too pushy with political agenda did not like brie as captain marvel
Mar 15 2019,neutral,the movie has its positives but the overall plot and story telling were flat brie larson and samuel jackson worked well together however the ending is anticlimactic i wouldnt pay to see the movie unless youre a mcu junkie 
Mar 15 2019,neutral,reasons to see   1 it has the set up for end game  2 nick fury  3 cat  4 cool but not spectacular cgi  5 it is a mcu movie  5 stan lee tribute and cameo  reasons to wait for itunes etc  1 larsons danvers is very uneven especially as the movie progresses which is the wrong direction one likes her better before she is human  2 no character growth there were no investments made or risks taken missing is the sacrifice that motivates captain marvel to grow at times the audience is left to wonder why should we care  3 supporting cast is much more interesting including the cat  4 tough old nick fury losses an eye in a very nonheroic fashion come on   5 the implausibility of the origin story is very difficult to overcome there is a lot of handwaving about why captain marvel becomes so powerful but not a lot of explanation or exposition the same can be said about the xmen and gotg but their powers are typically secondary to the plot and especially character development with marvel the angst is always the thing our heroes should feel overwhelmed inadequate and incapable of defeating an allpowerful enemy right up until they do using moxie intelligence teamwork and moral imperative this movie showed not of it and it felt deflating  6 the film feels too long it is nearly impossible to tell a good origin story without pushing firmly into a third hour but cm was overly ambitious having to share the origin tell its own story and propel the franchise into end game it should have come out around the same time as ant man as a complete stand alone and then a second release focusing on how carol danvers ends up at the avengers mansion dropped now  7 nick furys young face some have said the youthful cgi looks natural but i disagree in fact it strangely seems to become more noticeable as the film go on    this movie is tolerable but is probably the worst entry into the mcu certainly over the last few years my recommendation is to try to see this film before you see end game but wait for a good discount in theaters on an airplane or a rental with friends
Mar 15 2019,positive,i would die for goose i would die for carol too but she wouldnt need me to
Mar 15 2019,positive,thought it was ok  didnt find it particularly engaging action scenes were of very varying quality and acting was really mediocre  lashana lynch was the best thing about the movie in my opinion  she took her role very seriously and i hope we get to see more of her
Mar 15 2019,positive,captain marvel was an awesome movie basically an action chick flick the themes of women thriving after being manipulated by men and other women and of marginalized populations fighting for and possibly getting a voice and space in the world are much needed welcome and fitting for this moment in time
Mar 15 2019,negative,dont waste your time go see shazam instead
Mar 15 2019,positive,ive watched it twice now and it was better the second time  marvel does a great job with the details integrating it into the greater mcu
Mar 15 2019,positive,i thought it was an awesome movie took my 2 boys and they loved it fits in percect with what they have done in the marvel universe really awesome
Mar 15 2019,positive,different than most of the mcu but a welcome change  brie larson was fun in the role great 90s soundtrack and i love that there was zero romance  worth seeing
Mar 15 2019,positive,a little slow to start but once it picked up it didnt stop great action fun scenes awesome music brie larson took this character and made it her own welcome addition to the mcu
Mar 15 2019,negative,half star does it mean that im threaten by empowered woman neooow but god im so sick oh these movies bashing men why cant they co exist simultaneously this movie is the last jedi of the mcu reviewers giving this lame movie 5 stars really you mean this movie is on par with classic films with little room for improvement no wonder the film industry is struggling to get people into the theaters speaking of that i reluctantly went to see this film with a couple of friends shortly after the movie opened and there were a total of five men and only one woman so im left scratching my head as to the millions of dollars its making reportedly fake news i guess 
Mar 15 2019,neutral,it wasnt a bad movie not a great one marvel has its hits and misses and this one kindof just floats there   i wish her hair was short like in the comics but i guess they can implement that later  her character is a bit one dimensional or almost non existant  all i could get out of her by the movie is that she is witty and stubborndoesnt give up  thats about it   and i am disappointed to be honest having a strong female lead doesnt mean they have to be literally devoid of emotions and can kickass however she is a super hero so that is a given   not sure how she is going to help much in the endgame when she barely was shown at all in the picture
Mar 15 2019,negative,nothing special good effects but lacks a good story and compelling characters
Mar 15 2019,negative,the only good thing from this movie was samuel jackson it was boring the same as every other movie and did nothing
Mar 15 2019,negative,cheesy waste of money
Mar 15 2019,negative,brie larsons acting was laughable the rest of the cast did an amazing job however this movie does not deserve even close to a positive review
Mar 15 2019,positive,dont understand the negative reviews  was a good time  thought acting was good  enjoyed story line  looking forward to what captain marvel does in next infinity war  go see it  i was entertained
Mar 15 2019,neutral,just ok the best part was nick fury
Mar 15 2019,negative,it was one cliche after another but as a slight positive this movie didnt seemed as rushed as most of the marvel movies do
Mar 15 2019,positive,great movie  would see it again i didnt like her comments about the critics for a wrinkle in time but i think she did a good job playing a strong female military officer  they dont act like giddy school girls in real life either
Mar 15 2019,negative,not what i expected 
Mar 15 2019,positive,i found it equally exciting and funny the chemistry between larson and jackson was excellent with a powerful humanitarian message to boot as a 40something mama this had just the right dose of nostalgia but was relevant and flashy enough for my kids captain marvel is easily in my top 5 superhero flicks
Mar 15 2019,positive,i really enjoyed this movie it was a great addition to the marvel cinematic universe it did tell some things that we had wanted to know they did end up making the story so it was it weird that all of a sudden in the middle we now have another superhero that we hadnt heard of but most of all for the movie itself it was a good story it was good acting i liked all the characters and it was a good movie you could take your family to and engaging and well told superhero movie
Mar 15 2019,positive,i really enjoyed this movie  it is a fine addition to the marvel canon
Mar 15 2019,neutral,i could ignore the plot holes and write it off as one of the more mediocre marvel movies if it werent for the horrible casting choice of the main character and all of the atrocious retconing being done in this movie i actually enjoyed it more than i thought i would the media storm surrounding this had me all hyped up for something last jedi level awful this isnt that it is badish tho
Mar 15 2019,positive,all in all a very good introduction to carol d big fan of chewie aka goose impressive age regression special effects very enjoyable
Mar 15 2019,positive,over all to sum it up ok just ok nothing better a stale and forced performance from larson with the powerful female lead pushed far too much on us the only thing holding this film up by the thread of certified fresh is samuel l jacksons performance with humor and strong visuals overall if your into action without reaction this film is for you
Mar 15 2019,positive,very good and everything i was expecting and more
Mar 15 2019,negative,horrible movie no story no real emotions waste of money
Mar 15 2019,neutral,not bad not great  spend the first half of the movie trying to like the protagonist but its only in the last half of the movie that things really heat up
Mar 15 2019,positive,captain marvel feels like theyve done it quickly just to see karol danvers in end game at least its fun
Mar 15 2019,negative,horrible horrible horrible boring overpowered hero way to much push for the feminist movement as if its trying to hard brie larson was definitely not the right actress for the role story is lazy
Mar 15 2019,positive,awesome just what i needed
Mar 15 2019,positive,fueled by a great script and awesome performance by brie larson captain marvel swiftly compels a stunning story without being a faulty origin story
Mar 15 2019,positive,i was really impressed with captain marvel  brie larson was outstanding  it was funny exciting action packed emotional nostalgic and had a pretty good twist of events i wasnâtmt expecting
Mar 15 2019,negative,that moment when you try to make a point but just add to the stereotype glad i got free tickets and didnt waste my money just my time
Mar 15 2019,positive,i rather enjoyed it i kept hearing how bad it was but wanted to judge it for myself glad i did i liked it it isnt perfect but was enjoyable the reason i watch movies
Mar 15 2019,negative,iâtmm a big marvel fan however an hour into this movie i ended up walking out sadly itâtms completely unwatchable acting is horrible the writing struggles with holding a plot line overal horrroble no offense to the women who were empowered by this movie bad is bad
Mar 15 2019,positive,the very beginning is a little log but it picks up quick
Mar 15 2019,positive,loved this movie one of the better marvel films definitely go see also gives some context to whatâtms coming in avengers new movie
Mar 15 2019,negative,not an absolutely terrible film but definitely in the lower half of mcu movies i would rank this one below thor dark world captain marvel is too powerful and experiences little to no adversity and growth the movie is a sad lead in and makes me less excited for avengers end game
Mar 15 2019,positive,it was pretty good  i enjoyed it  it had some problems though  marvel tried to use the movie to answer mcu questions and tie things together  easter eggs are fun but this felt like it was trying to close plot holes from other films  next time let the film stand on its own  i love the connected nature of the mcu but balance is important  too many easter eggs and explanations can ruin a movie and i feel it slightly lowered the quality of this movie
Mar 15 2019,positive,movie was mediocre at best very disappointed in this marvel movie
Mar 15 2019,positive,in the first two minutes i knew i loved this character super pumped for avengers 4 now
Mar 15 2019,positive,i enjoyed the good storytelling with several surprises
Mar 15 2019,negative,disappointing  an insult mcus years of fantastic story telling  i really really wanted to love this movie i wanted great but got meh  captain marvel is a clear failure that had parts that just didnt didnt make any sense  if this movie wasnt released by marvel it would would have bombed at the box office
Mar 15 2019,negative,pretty boring mediocre samuel jacksons deaging is more uncanny valley than anything else
Mar 15 2019,positive,one of the best marvel moviessuperhero movies ever made
Mar 15 2019,negative,deviated too much from the source material and propped up the lead and downplayed all the supporting characters in this film
Mar 15 2019,negative,story seemed weak entire movie felt forced for avengers 4 action and cgi are great as is to be expected from mcu
Mar 15 2019,negative,i had a good time seeing the film just didnt like the film itself her acting was plastic and the effects were st too   for storyline dont even get me started  to be honest it may make for a good second film but i beg the universe to minimize her effect and appearance in avengers
Mar 15 2019,positive,captain marvel desperately wants to be about female empowerment and how a woman finally breaks free from the men holding her back by telling her shes not strong enough doesnt belong or cant control her emotions and while the movie goes about this in the most juvenile way possible it doesnt successfully convey this concept at all intentions aside due to poor writing and ineffective directing what we see on screen is a character who before serendipitously gaining powers from the tesseract is literally nothing and no one seriously there is virtually no development of her character before the crash the movie fails to make us feel for carol danvers the person in favor of whizpow action and feminine grandstanding outside of her friendship with maria rambeau she doesnt even seem to exhibit any curiosity about her former life maybe she had a controlling father but still is there no one in her family she longs to see or reassure thats shes still alive so much couldve been done to make carol danvers a heroinwaiting destined for greatness instead of someone whos story only begins after stumbling onto extraordinary powers by chance its a missed opportunity for a supposed groundbreaking film
Mar 15 2019,positive,iâtmd enjoyed it very much and iâtmm very excited to see what happens in avengers endgame
Mar 15 2019,negative,good movie if you are under 14 what couldnt she do
Mar 15 2019,negative,it was an alrightbut there wasnt and great about it if you compare it to wonder woman theres no comparison
Mar 15 2019,positive,donâtmt let the trolls scare you away very good particularly for an origin story
Mar 15 2019,negative,absolute trash  another marvel movie with the same plot as any other  only executed worse  i was more entertained watching shaq in steel
Mar 15 2019,positive,captain marvel is amazing  i loved every part of the movie
Mar 15 2019,negative,bad comic relief and no sense of danger or suspense in the second half
Mar 15 2019,positive,dont worry about the politics its a entertaing story with great graphics 
Mar 15 2019,positive,captain marvel is everything i wanted and more brie larson is spectacular and she played a perfect captain marvel
Mar 15 2019,negative,weak acting predictable dialogue kinda dull
Mar 15 2019,negative,my two daughters seemed ok with it they just didnt like the portrayal and just didnt connect the way they did with gal gadot as wonder woman i myself didnt find the humor in her arrogance the way i did with thors but the chemistry between larson and jackson was great it was just something off with the way she carried the captain marvel part maybe with sequels she will be able to bring out the human side of captain marvel rather than just be playing a part with her chest blown up and fist to her side
Mar 15 2019,negative,i wanted to watch this regardless of the media trolls and controvery after watching all other marvel movies i was really excited to see captain marvel the first 30 mins was confusing hard to follow boring and we gf and i fell asleep for a bit the movie really tried to use the women had it rough back then narrative to build the main capt marvels story so much that i felt more pity than i felt love for the character bries character also seemed very awkward at many times during the movie we laughed at many points during the movie that was supposed to be uplifting serious or iconic last point is that the main characters character arch was very confusing it wasnt the best marvel movie but it also wasnt the worst
Mar 15 2019,negative,not so marvel at all brie larson wasnt in the character  the lack of pace in the entire movie i was felling like watching iron man 3 again
Mar 15 2019,positive,carol danvers is op and bri larson is perfect for the role with her killer swag a few battle scenes were visually  too dark and actionblurry bit the film overall kicked ass
Mar 15 2019,positive,decent marvel movie  this one didnt utilize the comedic element nearly as well as the better majority of phase 3 movies  glad  is part of the avengers now though
Mar 15 2019,positive,one of my favorite movies in the marvel universe cant give it enough stars fabulous heroine
Mar 15 2019,negative,wont even watch it if i get pay for it
Mar 15 2019,neutral,if you liked the incredible hulk daredevil or cat woman movies youll love this one the humor is goofy and the 80s setting is offcolor the only enjoyable part was the end and sneak peek oh too much cgi making the shield characters look in their 20s
Mar 15 2019,negative,way to go inserting political agendas into these movies  absolutely loved them until now  boring unconvincing
Mar 15 2019,positive,not a bad movie not a great movie but definitely a good movie like mentioned by any there is good use of the typical marvel origin formula its fun to see a new ip coming to life in this already established universe and returning characters really sell the movie at the same time as a new one is introduced overall very enjoyable if you like the mcu if not its still a good popcorn flick    if i am to compare it to other mcu movies its better than antman 2 and gotg 2 but not as good as iron man og captain america this movie is comparable to iron man 2 except for the fact that you get the excitement of a new character    when all that is said ive seen a lot of anti sjw comments aimed at this movie giving it a lower score than i feel it deserves please be vigilant of these
Mar 15 2019,positive,absolutely great maybe not quite to the heights of black panther perhaps a lot of obvious choices but still done well and refreshingly original for a super hero origin story also brie larsons comedic chops are seriously under rated
Mar 15 2019,negative,its okay certainly not the best marvel movie all this hype is crazy and these articles reading way too into this movie and trying to make it sound so great and empowering to women and complicated plot etc smh no its definitely no wonder woman that was a great movie this is just meh and ive always liked brie larson but shes no carol danvers for the first time i feel like marvel just got a character wrong
Mar 15 2019,positive,this was huge amounts of fun  it fits right in with the rest of the mcu snappy dialogue and great character bits  if you are one of the people who likes the mcu but not this movie  you might want to look at your motives because this movie is more of the same
Mar 15 2019,positive,loved the comic book feel reminded me of ragnarok
Mar 15 2019,positive,a solid entry in the mcu capitan marve is a fun movie that makes makes me realize i needed a 90s super powered rock and roll hero all this time
Mar 15 2019,positive,i hesitated at first watching this movie but was surprised and really enjoyed it most people nowadays are so used to mindless overthetop action movies  this movie is inspiring with great action and heart its worth watching it
Mar 15 2019,positive,saw this with my daughter and wife clearly they had fun with this femalefueled story my only question whether male or female how does the marvel u deal with a character this powerful
Mar 15 2019,negative,not bad not great  acting felt a little dull  nice visuals
Mar 15 2019,negative,captain miscast the lead has no charisma otherwise the film is fun thanks to sam jackson one of the worst mcu entries
Mar 15 2019,negative,it had a few good points and potential for being something a lot greater but ultimately the movie was all over the place from pacing tone acting and overall feel i would say in general this movie had a bad case of identity crisis for me it felt like watching 4 tv super hero episodes back to back
Mar 15 2019,positive,an absolutely amazing movie
Mar 15 2019,negative,movie was boring and black panther level cgi in the third act i just felt like captain marvel was only shoved down our throat as being the most powerful superhero but was not really shown mediocre at best 
Mar 15 2019,negative,this film is worst than thor 2 terrible i was expecting more 
Mar 15 2019,positive,much better the 2nd time great story brie larson is fun likeable and relateable  captain marvel is a strong additional to the mcu
Mar 15 2019,positive,amazing acting by jackson and friendship with larson
Mar 15 2019,negative,an average movie with boring lead female actor larson that is only good because of samuel l jackson
Mar 15 2019,positive,although sometimes the humor does not work the story line and the acting are enough to keep the viewers interested
Mar 15 2019,negative,the story was pretty sloppy and it wasnâtmt that good compared to other marvel movies
Mar 15 2019,positive,awesome flick  brie larson is totally charming
Mar 15 2019,negative,with captain marvel marvel studios has finally placed their first femalefronted outing in the hands of one of their oldest and most enduring characters and one that is every bit as bold and fun as she ever was unfortunately the movie never lives up to the characterâtms name many of the triedandtrue marvel ingredients are here heroâtms journey irreverent humor bright colors nick fury but with a general lack of purpose beyond bluntly declaring the empowerment of women perhaps a few years too late and whetting our appetite until endgame  when an alien soldier named vers crash lands in 1990s america she is accompanied by nick fury and shield in order to stop an intergalactic disaster other than the 1990s part this should feel like extremely familiar territory this movie reeks of thor and guardians of the galaxy influences only without the brazen originality or import even where other lesser marvel films get by on the charm and intrigue of their hero larson falters not that itâtms really the oscarwinning actressâtms fault the movie is constantly telling us how âfunnyâ âbrashâ and âemotionalâ she is but never convincingly shows us   a common critique of these mcu films is that they are less movies and more episodes of an expensive tv series one that has throwaway episodes that only serve as minor bridges between the âimportantâ entries maybe i was just too blinded by fanboydom before now but this was the first time i truly felt that in that sense youâtmll probably wanna see this movie to stay up on whatâtms to come with this franchise but purely as an enjoyable moviegoing experience itself captain marvel is disposable
Mar 15 2019,neutral,underwhelming performance by the lead role predictable story way too much down time still delivers on the eye candy as marvel always does and the action sequences are on par with other movies in this universe     honestly they force the whole strong female hero element down your throat wonder woman achieved this exponentially better in every way this was an entire movies worth of look at my strong battle pose and smouldering look of confidence larson does not fit this role first casting mistake marvel has made in my opinion
Mar 15 2019,positive,oh my gosh this movie was utterly amazing i freaking loved the whole thing and how you never knew who you could trust it really kept you at the edge of your seat and it shed some light on things in other movies that didnt make as much sense definitely want to see it again 
Mar 15 2019,positive,marvel studios is hit and miss but they seem to do origin stories pretty good and i would place the new captain marvel film in my top 5 of marvel origin stories it is not perfect though arguably there is lot of stuff they have to cover here   they give it the ol college try for the most part it succeeds we are swept into the story right away and can barely can catch our breath from scene to scene it starts with action and really doesnt let up until somewhere in the 2nd act  brie larson is perfectly cast and believe it or not samuel l jackson can still act like a mofo with all that digital retouchingthe man has the gift the plot is straight from the comics and i am geekily glad about that but they do take a couple of forgivable liberties with the source material they even introduce monica rambeau who becomes important in later versions of the superheros journey  i recommend it on the big screen the digital flailing hair is worth the price of admission
Mar 15 2019,positive,shame on this site for ruining its reputation by allowing troll smear campaign
Mar 15 2019,positive,wasnt expecting to like this one as much
Mar 15 2019,positive,is it the best one perhaps not however its pretty freaking awesome and i dare say it maybe even better than wonder woman
Mar 15 2019,negative,captain marvels character and the acting is so boring the cat  nick fury are the only good thing about the movie probably the weakest mcu origin story so far should have gone to the movies with low expectations
Mar 15 2019,neutral,overall the movie had its moments but it wasnt enough to call this a great movie  it starts slow and just as its picking up pace it gets a little on the corny mib side and it takes away from what could have been much more  the 90s theme was nicely done and samuel l jackson really saved this movie from being a total disappointment  i felt the mid credit scene was the best part of the entire movie
Mar 15 2019,negative,boring mcu movie brie larson looks like she has no fun in this movie  the plot holes are glaringly obvious and the heros motivation is not clear at all  shame
Mar 15 2019,negative,it does not break the mold with a clumsy direction boring action scenes and even though it has a good cast the script doesnt allow them to show off the best thing is its soundtrack
Mar 15 2019,neutral,it was a painfully average film it wasnt bad but wasnt terrific either just sort of exists
Mar 15 2019,negative,meh movie the story telling is disjoint and doesnt work very well main character is unrelateble unemotional and overpowered    as one of the enemies says once to captain marvel  i never really liked you the heroine never really become a char you hope succed
Mar 15 2019,negative,my reviews have been deleted several times so far so ill just say this if you insist on seeing this in theaters get a matinee ticket it sure as hell isnt even worth that
Mar 15 2019,negative,first part was slow and boring the movie is somehow generic but hey the cat was great
Mar 15 2019,positive,one of the best standalone marvel films in awhile just a very compelling story with some great visuals and a lot of humor and heart brie larson is excellent as captain marvelcarol danvers samuel l jackson is also very good and the cgi on him is groundbreaking ben mendelsohn is the standout in the cast as the general for the skrulls just a really well made superhero movie
Mar 15 2019,positive,fantastic film ignore the critics and go watch it you will not be disappointed
Mar 15 2019,positive,saw this today with my daughter  we both really enjoyed the show  from the opening tribute to stan lee to the aftermath scene which ties in to the larger marvel timeline
Mar 15 2019,negative,after seeing the movie the movie really stood out as a weak introduction to captain marvel between itâtms strange use of pacing weird explanation to fan questions and campy feel youâtmll best save your money for the next marvel film
Mar 15 2019,positive,itâtms a mixed bag
Mar 15 2019,negative,about 18 months ago i got the felling i was seeing the same movie over and over this was the straw that broke the camels back yes i know the political message that is unsubtly smashed in viewers faces is the reason many dont like the film but it isnt all that bad its the film itself in fact its the whole franchise rewriting itself undoing what we knew in a transparent attempt to out bid the previous shock there are only so many new heroes that can be added that outpower the last hero they added before it feels so contrived and thats what this feels like contrived plot contrived casting and contrived acting i also love a bit of under and over acting the quiet one you just listen to due to force of personality or the over the top one who over acts and steals scenes they shouldnt be in the former is better suited to a supporting role but under acting in the way larson does in this is baffling i have to wonder how it was directed a movie that plays on emotions that repeats over and over how she has been emotionally affected by her past and her betrayals yet she hardly raises a lip to the point it feels like she might as well have a script in her hand and be doing a dry run there is under acting  then there is whatever this was not acting at all dunno i feel it was the directors fault though rather than larson because ive seen she is better than this overall this is perhaps 3 or 4 films too far the mcu feels like it has run its course a couple of years ago and is now dragging on
Mar 15 2019,neutral,its mildly entertaining for the most part but it is mired in continuity issues and contradicting aspects to established characters and events that weve watched over a 10 year period that make it seem incongruent within the mcu
Mar 15 2019,negative,a movie lacking both style and a heroic main character makes this origin story  feel flat and uninspired
Mar 15 2019,positive,loved it brie is epic as carol and carol is epic as captain marvel my favorite marvel film so far
Mar 15 2019,positive,great movie with a great hero   cant wait to see her interactions with the avengers
Mar 15 2019,negative,bland movie best part is nick and the cat that is sad to say
Mar 15 2019,negative,the worst movie of marvel a stupid fury a heroine who only looks annoyed and a weak script forms a lousy whole
Mar 15 2019,positive,this movie is absolutely amazing ignore the witch hunts and mob mentality of the internet always trying to ruin a good thing brie larson killed it she was instantly likable and did an amazing job portraying captain marvel another massive success for disney every time im not sure if they can pull it off again they go ahead blow the doors off this thing literally     explosive funny great vfx an allround good time and that cat too cute    life is too short to go around trolling and spreading hate people i pity those that arent able to simply enjoy a good thing 1010
Mar 15 2019,negative,heard mix reviews so decided to give it a chance wish i didnt the story was boring and brie larson didnt fit the role zero emotion and personality  waste of money
Mar 15 2019,positive,i thought this movie was amazing so many great underlining messages i will show these movie to all of my kids and i love the 90s so it brought me back to that
Mar 15 2019,positive,marvel did a great job with this one and big praise to the way the female lead was handled another win to the long list for kevin feige and marvel
Mar 15 2019,negative,havent seen such boring movie for years
Mar 15 2019,positive,this movie was very fun the age reduction cgi on samuel l jackson blows my mind very good marvel movie cant wait for endgame
Mar 15 2019,positive,its alright its nothing special or spectacular and it suffers from the same problems that a lot of superhero movies do for me    at the top of the list is a character who is basically perfect and indestructible there is as a result a lot of tensionfree action    however the movie lights up whenever samuel l jackson was onscreen most of the gags landed and i found his character and that of ben mendelsohns to be charming and sympathetic throughout    the problem with the character of carol danvers is that there wasnt really much of a character she suffers no real setbacks she doesnt appear to have any flaws or weaknesses shes just awesomeand thats kind of it which is fine it just means i dont care    there were a few eyerolling moments of hamfisted dialogue that stood out like a saw thumb as well but overall its a competent movie that fits somewhere in the middle of the mcu
Mar 15 2019,positive,awesome film wish there had been a film like this when i was 10 definitely want to see this again
Mar 15 2019,negative,film had a good amount of visual effects not too sure about the plot of the film it didnt tie in with previous films in the timeline such as agents of shield and other films and tv serries relating to the avengers but from my autistic point of view im disabled the film screamed girl power   so on that note i do not recomend the film
Mar 15 2019,positive,incredible compelling story and although there were some small issues i think it outdid a lot of the other individual superhero movies in the mcu imo it is undoubtedly better than iron man 23 thor 12 incredible hulk etc genuinely dont understand why people seem divided on it it set up end game perfectly whilst also giving some preavengers context
Mar 15 2019,positive,this movie was average it has its moments but i dont see myself watching this repeatedly like any avengers movie or ragnarok i think marvel would have been better served focusing on the scarlett witch or black widow solo movies than rushing this out this movie doesnt make you feel it tells you how you should feel brie larson lacks emotion and a strong character arc its just not a good effort
Mar 15 2019,positive,i love this movie the world needs more movies with strong women
Mar 15 2019,positive,this site is not allowing me to post what i really thinkj
Mar 15 2019,negative,what a horrendous movie my cat could write a better scriptï
Mar 15 2019,positive,great story and a wonderful balance between action and humor and goose
Mar 15 2019,positive,march 8 2019    watching captain marvel one cant help but think one of the main reasons it was made was because the title character must play a pivotal role in marvels greater fartherreaching avengers saga namely the forthcoming avengers endgame as a result its hard to disassociate from the idea this movie is but a mere stepping stone toward something more significant and therefore we cant take it as seriously or lend it as much attention as we might otherwise have if we didnt know wed be seeing captain marvel again real soon in something grander and more epic    this method of introduction has become the norm for any new entry in the evergrowing marvel comics universe landscape where each film now exists to build on and complement the others and while theres nothing wrong with the mcu movies functioning like their comic book counterparts in this regard it somehow makes the singlecharacter adventures feel less special     of course there are exceptions most recently and notably black panther which was so progressive and unique that it was able to stand on its own as a fullfledged selfcontained experience it was many believed a superhero movie for those who dont regularly go to superhero movies which in this day and age could be monthly    but my hunch is that nonsuperheromovie goers wont find themselves at captain marvel or at least not in the same capacity as they were at panther captain though highspirited and enjoyable is more of a template origin story and a routine introduction to a character whom the filmmakers will hopefully give something more interesting to do later on in the meantime we can appreciate this inaugural feature as a satisfying although not exactly indelible weekend action diversion    the story set in 1995 kicks off when a young fighter pilot named vers brie larson unaware of her immediate past suddenly wakes up from a perplexing recurring dream in which shes surrounded by smoke and debris from a recent explosion she sees another woman annette bening but she doesnt know who she is or how theyre connected    formerly a member of the us air force vers now serves alongside kree an advanced alien race in an elite military unit called starforce on the distant planet of hala thats a mouthful i know but dont let the strange names or vers current situation throw you offthe screenplay by geneva robertsondworet and codirectors anna boden and ryan fleck working from the marvel comics by stan lee who else and gene colan may start off fully coiled but it explains things fully and clearly as time goes by questions like where and how vers obtained her superhuman powers including advanced strength flight and the ability to project energy and light from her fists are eventually answered the fact the movie fills its narrative gaps nonlinearly is actually one of its charms and one of the ways it engages us    vers who has a reputation for being overconfident impulsive and cocky is under the tutelage of yonrogg jude law a native kree and leader of starforce who tells her theres nothing more dangerous to a warrior than emotion which is reiterated to her by the supreme intelligence an ai comprised of the greatest kree minds that takes a different form for everyone who visits it and in the case of vers its the same woman bening from her dreams and she too tells vers she needs to keep her emotions in check if shes to use her powers effectively which she hasnt yet been able to do and just like most superhero movies with the last one being spiderman into the spiderverse from just three months ago it goes without saying the main internal character conflict of captain marvel will involve vers coming to grips with her past abandoning her ego and learning to harness her abilities for the greater good    that opportunity gets set in motion shortly after a starforce mission goes awry when yonrogg leads vers and other kree soldiers played thanklessly by gemma chan and djimon hounsou on a mission to rescue an undercover operative algenis perez soto whos infiltrated a group of skrulls the skrulls are the krees sworn enemy a race of shapeshifters who have the ability to assume the looks of anybody they see kree and skrulls have been warring for centuries and vers just assumed the skrulls were inherently evil beings but this latest battle will be her first step toward her learning the truth    she escapes the clutches of skrull soldiers and their supposedly insidious commander talos ben mendelsohn by stealing a pod and landing on planet c53 otherwise known as earth after crashing into a blockbuster video remember those in the middle of los angeles vers in her colorful skintight space suit encounters shield agents nicky fury a digitally deaged samuel l jackson and phil coulson clark gregg who have never met anyone with vers powers before and arent all that willing to buy her story about distant planets skrulls or the like they simply think vers is off her rocker until that is they find themselves in the middle of all the kreeskrulls hoopla and come to realize earthlings arent alone in the universe    thus captain marvel serves not only as an origin story for its hero but also mcuregular nick fury whom we know will eventually birth the avengers initiative in this story he becomes vers faithful sidekick of sorts and we finally learn among other things how he lost his left eye    the rest of the plot is your typical marvel superhero stuff although its still entertaining with the same kind of humor emotion and narrative depth as most others of its kind the movie generates most of its substance when vers reunites with her old friend and fellow pilot maria rambeau lashana lynch along with rambeaus daughter monica akira akbar and eventually learns a humbling and valuable truth from talos including just what happened the day she tested an experimental engine designed by dr wendy lawson bening again who was actually a kree operative named marvell the engine exploded causing    well what it caused is for you to discover but as you do if youre generally an mcu fan its likely youll find captain marvel in between its perfunctory battle and special effects sequences does a commendable albeit uninspired job of adding interesting pieces to the overall mcu puzzle verscaptain marvels origin story is a pleasing one and the cast members are right and enthusiastic in their respective roles but its not so special or distinct that we dont think of it as anything beyond simple popcorn entertainment still if this series follows the same trend as captain america and antman itll be the sequels where it really shines until then we can think of captain marvel as a worthy introduction and await the crucial part shell play in endgame
Mar 15 2019,positive,i thought it was great and i didnt feel like it was slow like other reviews suggested cant wait for endgame
Mar 15 2019,negative,i love the mcu it brings back childhood memories of characters in  comics i used to read and nd enjoy with that being said captain marvel is hot garbage brie larsen is going to be the anchor that sinks the mcu she is a no talent hack that doesnt deserve to be in the same room as the likes of robert downey samuel jackson scarlet johannsen chris hemmsworth and all the others  anyone would of portayed captain marvel better than her dwayne the rock johnson in a blond wig would of been a better captain marvel emily blount should of got the role or perhaps charlize theron marvel needs to make a clean break from brie larsen move on to a better actor ala from terrance howard to don cheadle in the role of rhodywar machine do it mcu before its too late
Mar 15 2019,negative,terrible movie with hodgepodge of different events and surprises everyone saw coming
Mar 15 2019,positive,after a bit of a rough start captain marvel finds its footing with the chemistry scenes between brie larson and samuel l jackson  thanos is in big trouble
Mar 15 2019,negative,not interesting enough no emotions and no connection to the character in any way
Mar 15 2019,negative,worst marvel movie yet garbage boring and robotic type acting unlikeable characters
Mar 15 2019,negative,while it does feature an interesting atmosphere with its 90s setting captain marvel does absolutely nothing to set it apart from all of the other super hero films in an otherwise horribly overcrowded genre
Mar 15 2019,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed this film the story line kept me guessing and captain marvel is a great role model for young women its not romantic in the least captain marvel comes into a full understanding of who she and what she accomplish by the culmination of the movie
Mar 15 2019,positive,its awesome and everyone should watch it
Mar 15 2019,positive,utterly fantastic one of my first marvel movies will have to check out the other ones wanted to see the female heroine
Mar 15 2019,positive,excellent movie highly entertaining loved every minute of it
Mar 15 2019,positive,i thought this was pretty good
Mar 15 2019,positive,goose is obviously the best marvel character ever
Mar 15 2019,positive,a great movie lots of action loved the strong women who are also smart it was wonderful seeing carol realize her powers go see it
Mar 15 2019,positive,the editing was a little bit frantic but the movie was fine not the best marvel film but defiantly not the worst
Mar 15 2019,positive,this movie was wonderful its not preachy and it doesnt shove any opinion down your throat captain marvel has a well developed personality and character she isnt a token female character and she isnt a woman acting like a man shes a person   i enjoyed every minute 
Mar 15 2019,positive,90s movie released today
Mar 15 2019,positive,i liked it  almost missed it because of the hate talk  glad i went  its fun  well paced and written  funny at points and great action scenes  see it enjoy it
Mar 15 2019,positive,its a really fun little movie the skrulls make an interesting threat and marvels dynamic with fury is great if you like marvel movies youll like this movie
Mar 15 2019,positive,thoroughly enjoyable
Mar 15 2019,positive,one of the better marvels films good back story to fury not like the typical marvel films which are the same films recycled over and over again
Mar 15 2019,neutral,sorry but this movie sucked it wasnt a horrible movie but it seemed like a rushed sloppy story  too little to late in the female superhero game never mind that it was clearly forcing itself into the existing mcu timeline but added no real relevance to it but at least sam jackson was great as always 
Mar 15 2019,negative,the movie is mediocre as a stand alone and abysmal as part of the mcu it is in no way true to source materials and feels like a forced political statement full of plot holes and horrible story telling it makes me worried for the future of marvel
Mar 15 2019,positive,this movie is not a five but it is definitely worth seeing 
Mar 15 2019,positive,cant believe folks are saying this character isnt feminist enough with a theme of using your emotions as power dont suppress them awesome fire mohawk at the end and way to kick sass in them of your emotions as power dont suppress them awesome fire mohawk at the end and way to kick sass in every way
Mar 15 2019,positive,larson is better than i expected though i still think the role was miscastthe rest of the movie is confusing and predictable at the same time
Mar 15 2019,negative,simply mediocre on all levels and a bad marvel film retcons a good amount of the mcu
Mar 15 2019,negative,very poorly made movie keep your agendas out of my marvel movies disney
Mar 15 2019,negative,i did not like it at all  very predictable plot and not great overall
Mar 15 2019,positive,its fine nothing exceptional but its a marvel movie and i quite enjoyed watching it
Mar 15 2019,positive,this movie is rated where it needs to be i give it a 665  good cast bad writing i was expecting more but i was bored i hope better character role in endgame
Mar 15 2019,negative,the worst marvel movie
Mar 15 2019,neutral,painfully avarage they made captain marvel overpowered in the end i hope they are not trying to push her down our throats
Mar 15 2019,positive,so well done loved the soundtrack the actorsall of it definitely stay until the very end
Mar 15 2019,neutral,at least for me these moovie is divided in two the first one is the moovie that i wanted to see with a young nick fury and the skrulls and then in the second part an nonsence overpowered cap marvel that faces no real threat the character did not earn my heart but at least it earned my respect
Mar 15 2019,positive,thats odd now that more people see it they more they like it
Mar 15 2019,positive,incredible it was amazing to see a smart funny powerful female superhero who fit so well into the marvel universe she is a great addition to the avengers everyone should see this movie 
Mar 15 2019,negative,bland and predictable offers nothing new to the genre he direction is misguided and uninspired the nonlinear structure just doesnt work for this movie so the script is done poorly as well the surprise twist is basically given away by the movie itself tons of  inconcistencies regarding the plot maybe if the movie wasnt hyped up as much it couldve hold better
Mar 15 2019,negative,aside from political and social agenda this movie is your standard superhero origins story  i do believe though that if it were a male superhero movie it would have been criticized by critics but anyways  in a superheroaction movie there is an arc usually with the evolution of the main character here we dont see it carol danvers suffers amnesia always is on top is always on top and the only time we see a weakness by reminiscing the past a far away past that doesnt seem to match her levels during the movie   as an mcu fan i was a little sad about the fury losing an eye part the idea that captain america the first avenger isnt the real title anymore because now she is and that the name of the avengers comes from a picture seen on the wall with carol now you see this picture overcenters on her without really showing any flaws s  comic captain marvel always wasnt appreciated and here marvel had a chance to make her shine their attempt failed for me hopefully some girl out there will like her more  also note for rt accept both sides of the bell a movie will be likable for one side and ugly for the other doesnt mean you have to remove all negatives
Mar 15 2019,negative,this movie was so boring  i think i am done with marvel
Mar 15 2019,negative,a very slow film that failed to keep my attention
Mar 15 2019,negative,it was alright villain lacked any motivation protagonist wasnt interesting and lacked any emotional investment even though she was told multiple times to control her emotions enjoyable movie but not spectacular endgame will blow this out of the water
Mar 15 2019,negative,disappointing only two stars saved the movie samuel l jackson and the cat
Mar 15 2019,positive,it was a solid movie strong female comic book character brought to stunning life it was funny it fit into the universe thats been established the only let down was the method of nick fury losing his eye beyond that it was a fun movie
Mar 15 2019,positive,all the stars  this movie was amazing from beginning to enddo not believe haters  touching action packed funny rockin it actually paints women as capable complex intereting and mighty  and thats with one arm tied behind their backs
Mar 15 2019,positive,entertaining and just enough comic relief to be fun
Mar 15 2019,positive,this movie was amazing made me laugh and cry i was never interested in anything marvel before this movie now iâtmm obsessed brie larson was incredible
Mar 15 2019,positive,cant understand the really negative reviews  it is a fun film acting is good it has a decent number of jokes the action is good and the script was decent and had a really good swerve which i wasnt expecting
Mar 15 2019,negative,told she canâtmt play baseball thatâtms her sad story superman had his planet destroyed
Mar 15 2019,positive,pretty fun movie its not as bad as i expected to be based on the reviews some of brie larsens lines were a little flat but overall not a bad performance marvels the company not the character villain game is still weak though
Mar 15 2019,positive,fantastic movie  definitely see it again and adding it to my 3d marvel movie collection
Mar 15 2019,positive,great action scenes your typical marvel movie didnt really get to know carol danvers that much
Mar 15 2019,negative,this is the worst thing the mcu has put out by leaps and bounds they butcher the skrulls and waste a golden opportunity to introduce them as formidable civilization invading galactic havoc wreakers which is exactly what every true comic book fan was hoping for and deserved captain marvel has literally no personality or redeeming human qualities of which we can relate to or identify with there is no human struggle or tragedy or character flaw given to the character to make her more likeable or relatable she gets her powers from something that we have already seen nearly destroy all 4 gotgs granted its not the same infinity stone but its an infinity stone and starlord is half freaking god planet no way she can absorb its power you showed us thats impossible for a human to do  nick fury is a completely different person in this movie as well he is nothing like the present day fury in any way shape or form he is the freaking comedic side kick nick effing fury is the comedic sidekick let that sink in knowing him not only from the mcu but from the comics also i hope they reboot this trash captain marvel character 5 times in the next 7 years like they have the comic book counter part cuz it is an absolute abomination save your money and just look up the bonus scenes online smdh
Mar 15 2019,positive,captain marvel  initial reaction sounds much better than private marvel    main characters  carol danvers sheâtms the pilot turned superhero  sheâtms played by brie larson  nick fury head of shield  heâtms played by samuel l jackson    plot summary  carol is on another world battling a race of shape shifters  however the whole mission goes wrong and she ends up on earth    on earth she meets up with nick fury and they from a tentative partnership  sheâtms looking for a high tech laboratory in order to keep it out of the wrong hands    and nickâtms along for the safety of earth  but along the way carol gets hit with flashbacks of her life before she became the alien superhero  and those flashbacks say she lived her life here on earth then was changed after an encounter with some aliens    scoring  main characters  i like these two a lot  they work really well together with him being the logical side and her being the emotional side  score 9    supporting cast  some of the other humans are interesting namely an agent named coulson and carolâtms best friend and fellow fighter pilot  and a few of the shape shifting aliens have some interesting personality in them  score 9    plot  for the most part this is a fun ride  the action sequences are a blast and the scenes between carol and nick are great    but the memory parts just felt contrived â they give out just the needed information in order to push the plot forward  score 8    originality  stories about someone finding out theyâtmre superheroes have been done a lot lately and it may be refreshing that itâtms a female led story but thatâtms about it  score 7    violence factor  weâtmve got your usual superhero fights in this film where people and aliens get punched shot dropped very long distances and forced through thick walls  this can get tiring  score 6    other moral issues  this film is about how a personâtms background is important â and how they can use their emotion to overcome their obstacles  but the message gets a bit scattered to meet with the plot demands  score 8    final score out of 60 47 score  7833  itâtms another fun inventive marvel film  now to see how it all ends with endgame
Mar 15 2019,positive,much better than wonderwoman  excellent film great cast and brie is great  marvel did this justice with no love interest just a powerful lady getting the job done take note dc
Mar 15 2019,positive,loved every second probably going to see it again
Mar 15 2019,positive,doesnt deserve the bad wrap its getting gets a little to cheesy at times seemed like this one was more for the kids larsens character was to emotionless if they wouldve let her act id give it another star but overall it was decent
Mar 15 2019,positive,i give it a seven out of 10 the movie was good but nothing special it did have a lot of feminism in it its on par with the other marvel movies it is definitely not better than civil war or winter soldier i watch these movies because i love marvel and dc movies captain marvel is an ok film on par with thors first film the only reason this movie is making a lot of money is because its brand new and it ties in with the infinity war movie if this movie had came out five or six years ago it would not do as well i did not feel a sense of power when captain marvel realized she was powerful i cannot get behind her it did also feel like the first iron man the same animation when she was flying around and shooting at stuff with her photon blast was like ironman its worth it to see it one time in the theater and that is it here is to hulk smashing thanos in the endgame
Mar 15 2019,negative,the acting was entirely forgettable didnt seem to be a great marvel movie i should have passed on this one 
Mar 15 2019,positive,awesome one of the best marvel films underrated because newcomers dont understand the intricate plot and marvel pros like me may object to some of the storyline inconsistencies like only a god can touch the tesseract cat also marvell was a man mr marvell but i liked the modern adaptations and im happy marvell was a woman my only criticism is not serious enough i got a tear in wonder woman i didnt get enough emotion in captain marvel
Mar 15 2019,negative,i found that the story was a bit to clichã c and most of the characters forgettable except fury i also found that it messed with already established marvel history and just threw it all away
Mar 15 2019,negative,bland safe and perscribed reminds of the early rough patches the mcu had with efforts like thorthor 2 and iron man 2 very little passion or care present in the work here and a pretty inconsistent and uncharismatic performance from larson its still a fully functioning hollywood movie but is totally sterile
Mar 15 2019,positive,the movie wasnt horrible but it also wasnt amazing either in my opinion it seemed to have some pacing issues in the beginning but closer to the middle to the end it was getting more enjoyable it also had some funny moments in it the cat was probably the most funniest part of the movie and for carol danvers brie larson she was alright but not amazing i hope for the next movie they push for a better story  andto add the de aging on samuel jackson was amazing probably the best i have seen
Mar 15 2019,positive,amazing movie i loved it must see
Mar 15 2019,positive,it was fine not good not bad but okay
Mar 15 2019,positive,love it all ready pre ordered the movie and about yo gonseenitvagain 
Mar 15 2019,positive,kudos to marvel for another groundbreaking movie even though the story wasnt as strong as i would have liked i was thoroughly entertained good job and keep em coming
Mar 15 2019,positive,great movies awesome story line
Mar 15 2019,positive,absolutely first rate superhero tale action packed from start to finish with great music humour effects and brill script with no word wasted seen it twice and even better 2nd time get in cant wait to see marvel in avengers endgame too
Mar 15 2019,positive,base entertainment value 45  family friendliness 55  meaningfulness 45  bottom line this was a solid marvel movie and i strongly recommend it    my thoughts this movie amazed me in that it hit all of the feminist talking points without coming across as a feminist movie this is a good thing even if you are a devout feminist you should be happy about this just like im happy when as a devout christian a movie comes out that hits all of the christian talking points without coming across as a christian movie  something i hated the air force still wasnt letting women fly combat missions back then so testing lawsons planes was the only chance we had to do something meaningful  this statement seems absurd to me is she saying that all women who arent in combat arent doing anything meaningful maybe thats too broad maybe shes saying that for herself and danvers only flying for the air force had meaning and this was the only way they could fly for the air force but doesnt that imply that her own daughter had little to no meaning to her im just really confused by this statement but if anyone can explain to me id be happy to listen  something i loved i dont have anything to prove to you  i loved this statement because it perfectly illustrated my views on complimentarianism what ive picked up from the feminist culture is that feminists believe only masculine achievements are worthwhile they encourage women by telling them they can do whatever they want to do but are very hard on women who value the traditional feminine virtues of beauty vulnerability motherhood and supportiveness not to say that they have a problem with any of those things its just that if a woman has chosen to dedicate her life to them its considered a waste unless shes is also accomplished meaning shes achieved status in her career  personally i believe the feminine virtues are more powerful than any amount of accomplishments and so to see  refuse to ignore her obvious strengths when asked to prove that she could be a better man than the actual man well to me that was incredibly beautiful
Mar 15 2019,positive,captain marvel finds vers desperate to join the fight to defeat the skrulls a marauding race taken to terrorist actions to weaken the kree who vers is fighting for  during this time vers begins to see flashes of a life she does recognise visions that lead her to earth where she discovers her past life as carol danvers ace fighter pilot  its here she crosses paths with an inexperienced and sceptical nick fury in 1990s sceptical at least until the skrulls bring their fight to earth   i really loved captain marvel  i loved the nostalgia of the 90s setting which also meant the film had a great soundtrack the back story to the kree and the skrulls was really well done the humour was spot on the deaging of samuel l jackson looked amazing and i thought brie larson was a great lead  my only worry now is that the other avengers might as well hand their notice in because the power behind this character can pack more of a punch than all of them put together really looking forward to seeing captain marvel hand thanos ass to him
Mar 15 2019,positive,great movie will see it again
Mar 15 2019,positive,canâtmt believe all the dumb controversy around this movie just go see it as if it were a normal marvel movie i loved every minute of it it had a good balance of action comedy and moving along of the plot canâtmt really think of any complaints would see it again
Mar 15 2019,negative,too much feminist film  and the actress is not involved with the character too sad
Mar 15 2019,negative,i felt like bree had so little dialogue for being the lead in this movie and was carried along by sam jackson not to mention the movie showcased him more than it did her
Mar 15 2019,positive,the movie was good they change the story line up a lot but it didnt take away from the impact of the story sort of
Mar 15 2019,negative,what a boring sullen unlikeable unbearable character this is
Mar 15 2019,positive,it was a great entry in mcu although captain marvel herself comes off a bit cocky and immature great appetizer for endgame
Mar 15 2019,neutral,captain marvel was an average super hero movie at best if youre looking to compare captain marvel to wonder womanwonder woman wins hands down just not enough wow moments in captain marvel to make me want to go back for a second look in the theater 
Mar 15 2019,positive,i wanted more but wasnâtmt overall disappointed
Mar 15 2019,positive,solid entry brie larson gives a great performance with a lot of character
Mar 15 2019,positive,the movies within the mcu that shine brightest are the ones focused on character development this is not one of those mcu movies i was really hyped for this one but it was all plot and no substance for me we never got to see what made the characters tick we are so deep into the superhero movie genre your best bet is to focus on fleshing out your characters more
Mar 15 2019,negative,was a rather boring movie overall i enjoyed wonder woman much more there didnt need to be a nee character introduced before endgame also i didnt feel any character growth or have any interest in captain marvel as well
Mar 15 2019,negative,as someone who cant ignore plot holes i find it hard to like this movie also nothing really makes this film stand out or done better
Mar 15 2019,positive,this film was a lot of fun the special effects were amazing and always a treat to see samual l jackson in action iâtmm obsessed with hair so i do wish captain marvels hair was a little better like in the endgame trailer i like how we have a female character that is confident and standoffish sheâtms a soilder and you can tell i donâtmt know why people can accept a full of himself male character but not a female iâtmm excited to see this character grow and open up more
Mar 15 2019,neutral,decent origins movie but nothing more honestly doesnâtmt compare to any other marvel movie hopefully they get captain marvel 2 right
Mar 15 2019,positive,i honestly enjoyed it the acting from brie larson could have been more enthusiastic and the way fury losing his eye could have been better but overall not a bad movie id give it a 710
Mar 15 2019,positive,for a decadeslong fan of the comics  esp the deconnicklopez take this film was very gratifying a bit overpowered near the end perhaps but great scenes between carol  her bff as well as fury and i liked the green twist in the 2nd half  very timely well done kb
Mar 15 2019,neutral,wasnâtmt as bad as everyone said it wasnâtmt overloaded with feminist ideals and some parts were really funny overall itâtms dissappointing for a phase 3 mcu film maybe would be good if it was phase 2 the action was okay overall and the plot was dreadful decent movie overall worth seeing the first time itâtms defin not worth a second trip as most mcu films are
Mar 15 2019,negative,captain marvel chooses an ideology over good story telling
Mar 15 2019,positive,this was a rollicking ride full of fun action sequences juxtaposed by a compelling story of personal discovery
Mar 15 2019,positive,enjoyed it enough to see it twice opening weekend
Mar 15 2019,negative,that movie is too bad itâtms lousy i expected more thanks anyway
Mar 15 2019,negative,worst dont watch
Mar 15 2019,neutral,this is funny but bad at the same time
Mar 15 2019,positive,we enjoyed it personally i found the female empowerment message a tiny bit heavy handed but this is just a quibble  its a fun parkyourbrainatthedoor popcorn movievery enjoyable and the fx are second to none
Mar 15 2019,positive,this movie despite what people might say in the reviews is not boring at all in fact this movie is the opposite of that it has plenty of action scenes and larson was brilliantly funny especially the scenes with nick fury and captain marvel maybe some guys feel threatened by a woman who plays a main character  anyways a must see movie that really should deserve at least 90 on rotten tomatoes 
Mar 15 2019,negative,terrible movie not to mention the lead in this movies is a sexist i cant support a movie that helps sexist agendas and a lead that openly hate white males when black panther is the top grossing movie in america and nominated for best film crazy right
Mar 15 2019,negative,simple put a let down i went into the movie hoping that i would walk out with more excitement for avengers end game but instead was left with a bad taste in my mouthand it wasnt the popcorn i personally feel that it was the directing or possibly even the writing behind the movie which lead me to disliking captain marvel the begging starts strong but quickly falls short for me when time after time i felt like i was being lead on a pointless goose the cat chase the special effects where nothing to marvel over compared to what we have seen in the past however there where a few great camera shot done for the movie the story at times felt very jumpy and there are many moments when the story or characters believe or understand something just for the sake of the movie the comedy sadly was flat too and at times felt very forced and some scenes too that if they hadnt been in the film we wouldnt have missed any story telling there where some cool nods to the 90s but after a while it felt like to much finally it was sad to see so many past characters to be written down to be so weakvillains and heros i would have loved to see them at least put up a fight because who is going to be scared or frighten by and villain that just turns tail and runs i hope that captain marvel is able to show us more in the upcoming avengers movie and assist in giving us a movie everyone can enjoy
Mar 15 2019,negative,i was underwhelmed that was direct to video level entertainment  its like they totally ignored mcu continuity to squeeze in this character full on just plain lazy ass writing good tactical decision on disneys part releasing this movie 45 days before avengers end game this was a well timed money grab
Mar 15 2019,positive,with all the controversy surrounding the film and star brie larson captain marvel turned out to be an enjoyable movie although perhaps out of place in the current ending of phase 3 of the mcu i must say that i was worried that the movie would be pushing a hyperfeminist narrative and from the trailers brie larson did not seem to be a very likable character  after watching the movie i must admit that not only was the feminist narrative way overstated on the internet brie larson was fairly charming as captain marvel  the story itself set before any other mcu movie in the mid90s was a simple origin story which flipped the whos the bad guy narrative on its heels this was an enjoyable twist that was a refreshing addition to the various ways the mcu tells superhero stories  overall i believe this movie should have taken place in phase 1 or 2 but sets up well for cm to come help out the remaining avengers defeat thanos in endgame
Mar 15 2019,positive,it is a good movie  its different story is a 90s old movie   not just fight
Mar 15 2019,negative,almost everything about this movie feels like wasted potential from the 90s references to the titular character herself nothing feels completely fleshed out in a way that is satisfying the majority of the plot centers around carol danvers figuring out who she is and by the end of the movie i still couldnt tell you     the writing is quite disjointed and i really dont know what defines her personality because it often seems to change even mid scene she is strong i guess the digital deaging of sam jackson is an amazing feat and for that alone it receives a star unfortunately though placing nick fury in this movie is really a waste while i liked all of his scenes here because he elevates larsons rather poor acting it causes issues with his characterization within the continuity of the rest of the marvel universe part of the allure of the nick fury character is how he is mysterious and like all prequels they have removed that danvers sloppy characterizations means she works best when she is onscreen with a personality that is better defined like fury or her friend monica but doesnt work with jude law or the other aliens    there are times that i recognized the movie was trying to have some sort of emotional beat but there wasnâtmt enough groundwork laid to actually sell it similarly there is a twist that suffers from the same issue as there really isnâtmt any justification or ramifications in the later scenes shouldnâtmt captain marvel feel something for now fighting against her former friends people that she has spent years training and having fun with why is the huge emotional impact of her or them being traitors missing there might have been a kernel of a good story here but it needed at least a few more passes to get it right    writing quite poor acting mediocre for the main character okay for everyone else special effects stunning
Mar 15 2019,positive,while captain marvel is not a groundbreaking top tier mcu film it is still an overall great time at the theater and stands right up to female lead superhero films such as wonder women with brie larson giving the comic accurate performance of the character while also being a bit different to be very likable between brie larson and samuel l jacksons buddy cop chemistry you cant ask for a better duo for the film especially when seeing the incredible cgi deageing work for samuel l jackson it is a fun ride but has its flaws mostly in overused exposition bad lighting in action sequences and a under usage of some of the supporting cast that we dont get to know too much about in the film overall the film is a great time at the
Mar 15 2019,positive,good movie worth seeing in the cinema hokey ending  end could have been better done  
Mar 15 2019,positive,it was awesome loved it going back again
Mar 15 2019,positive,a really cool ad fun watch some of the dialogue and performances can be cringeworthy but it certainly entertains with its action performances and its overall charm mot to mention and great 90s soundtrack
Mar 15 2019,positive,the individual performances of this movie stand out i was actually surprised to see that i thoroughly enjoyed brie larson as captain marvel the overarching plot of the movie isnâtmt much to write home about though ultimately holding the film back all in all it is an enjoyable film that is just a small appetizer until we reach the conclusion of decade worth of storytelling in endgame
Mar 15 2019,positive,all the feels loved it
Mar 15 2019,positive,it was a very enjoyable movie with a very nice plot goes nicely in the mcu
Mar 15 2019,negative,absolutely awful dont waste your time
Mar 15 2019,negative,what a terrible miscast
Mar 15 2019,positive,excellent movie my daughters loved it
Mar 15 2019,positive,great addition to the marvel movies  very fun ride  enjoyed getting to see fury and colton in the past and how they came to know captain marvel  didnt think i would like larson in this movie but she nailed it
Mar 15 2019,negative,nothing much happening till almost 34 of the moviemy wife fell asleep next to me in the theater
Mar 15 2019,negative,it is not as fun as guardians of the galaxy and not as serious as any other marvel movie there is also a lack of any danger or thrill which leaves this movie horribly bland  cool special effects thought
Mar 15 2019,positive,loved it fun ridiculous in places as a superhero movie should be great action great chemistry between slj and brie larson annette bening is always a joy to see just a fun good superhero movie seems unfairly targeted for criticism when its an aboveaverage example of the genre like most marvel movies marvell 
Mar 15 2019,positive,i loved it i loved the humor the strong female characters the fact that the women werenâtmt dressed in skimpy or clingy costumes and of course the cat
Mar 15 2019,positive,i actuallly loved this film  best mcu ensemble yet and it leaves you excited for more stories with these characters
Mar 15 2019,positive,this movie was really nice i donât understand why everybody hate it
Mar 15 2019,positive,absolutely stunning
Mar 15 2019,negative,saw the movie last night seriously save your money whoever played captain marvel was a horrible actress scenes just seemed so awkward at times the action in the movie was the only good part  stan lees cameo im mad this movie wasnt as good as people said it was going to be marvel needs to invest in better actors  actresses probably the only marvel movie i wont buy  i usually buy all of them god i hope the new avengers movie isnt this bad tm
Mar 15 2019,positive,i liked it a lot it was a great introduction to carol danvers and captain marvel in general i liked the performances the effects are great the easter eggs and tieins to the mcu were fun all in all a lovely movie with an amazing protagonist played by a very talented person seeing fury and coulson together again gave me life although seeing them deaged was very odd
Mar 15 2019,positive,after being underwhelmed by the trailers i was very pleasantly surprised better than many of the other marvel origin films
Mar 15 2019,negative,had high hopes for this one  but its boring  middle school plot  grade school acting  nice special effects but overall terrible
Mar 15 2019,negative,stop making this about gender  its about failure people loved alita wonder woman and so on  we love woman characters in marvel black widow scarlet witch the elder one and so on  i was waiting for this movie like crazy for a long time now but when i saw it it was a screw up
Mar 15 2019,negative,as a standalone film only ok has some fun moments brie larson could have shined as an actor but the writing had no clear characterization for her the strips and humor felt a bit out of place and the cat ruined the tone of the film the last fight scene was just basically a flex on captain marvel and had no real purpose or challenge weight    as a marvel film terrible they ruined nick fury as a character he was funny yet his actions never contributed to the film the tesseract was able to be eaten by a simple alien life form which also destroyed tone of the film most of all my complaint is with the directors and writers the acting was pretty good
Mar 15 2019,positive,great addition to the mceu
Mar 15 2019,negative,medicore brie larson brings nothing to the table at best its iron man 3 was so excited to see especial after infinity war production felt rush without direction with the soul purpose of just being a filler to end game safe to say you wont miss much if you dont watch it
Mar 15 2019,positive,loved it very good introduction of the character
Mar 15 2019,neutral,the visuals were fun but the storyline was uninspired the character arch wasnt there it really needed better writing the cat was the best part of the movie i found myself getting bored with the memory losscharacters though it was cool seeing a young nick fury and some of the 90s nostalgia call backs the story needed more
Mar 15 2019,negative,might have been even worse than i expected even if you disregard the agendas pushed in this movie it was still bland and unentertaining
Mar 15 2019,positive,really well done movie fun plot twists very good acting and lots of cameos from other marvel characters
Mar 15 2019,positive,loved this movie my daughter has a new favorite marvel hero
Mar 15 2019,positive,this is an excellent marvel film if you are in any way interested in seeing powerful female performancesif you want to know some background on shield early daysif you arent a troll well then this movie is for you
Mar 15 2019,negative,it tried to hard  i found it pretty boring and uninspired
Mar 15 2019,neutral,perhaps i was influenced by the negative reviews but i couldnt help but see what they were talking about when i watched it wasnt bad nor was it great it was okay  captain marvel did say a lot if witty things but delivered with a muted sarcasm this shouldnt be taken as a swipe at ms larsens acting abilities i imagine she was directed to do so and i doubt it is easy to pull that off however when she met the intelligence at the beginning i felt that was some poor acting requiring a reshoot action scenes not cg were okay but her suit clearly hampered her ability to move making her run funny and whatnot future movies should address the suit also one particular scene clearly was a stunt double  my biggest gripe isnt about the movie so much as the character she is waaaaay to overpowered i even hear rumours she can time travel people complain that superman is overpowered and she could beat him easily she could beat anyone easily how can future movies be interesting if the villain has no chance there was no part of this movie where it appeared she couldnt handle it  not only is she overpowered but she instantly knew how to use her powers one second she didnt even know she had a power and the next she already knew how to use it  furthermore the way she got her power shouldnt have given her powers it should have disintegrated her this has been both directly stated and demonstrated in previous marvel movies
Mar 15 2019,positive,great movie the cast was amazing love goosethe cgi were ok
Mar 15 2019,positive,i thought this movie was a very antiquate movie i thought the story acting and most the action was pretty solid  i also enjoyed the major twist that they provide in the second act  this movie is however not great  i had a problem with not only carols opness but also everyone elses it seemed like everyone who was not a human was virtually invincible along with that it also  just wasnt as good quality as some of the more recent marvel movies and is more on the level of thor 1 or captain american 1  still no bad marvel movie is inherently bad and this movie still gives the right amount of laughs thrills chills and feels  plus the post credit scene makes it all worth it
Mar 15 2019,positive,enjoyable because of its connection to marvel but it lacks the fun and excitement of many other mcu movies the actress playing captain marvel does not strike me as having much fun playing this character and it creates a yawning experience for the moviegoer
Mar 15 2019,neutral,it was meh not bad but not the excitement i get with other marvel films
Mar 15 2019,negative,only thing i enjoyed in the movie was the cat hope it is in endgame
Mar 15 2019,positive,really like it awesome effects and story if you hate it the fans will have more space in cinemas
Mar 15 2019,negative,the plot was very convoluted the acting was sub par and the main characters arch is basically non assistant  very disappointing that this poorly written last minute mcu character will apparently be integral to the end game movie instead of the teased adam warlock or just the remaining avengers on their own
Mar 15 2019,negative,vapid forgettable and not worth the 9 i spent i wasnt going to write a review but then i saw the utter bs of this website and knew i had to make a stand if youre reading this dont believe the fake accounts saying this movie is good its a joke and so is this biased website go see how to train your dragon youll have a much better time
Mar 15 2019,positive,the movie was amazing
Mar 15 2019,positive,a truly fun movie had a blast  action with funny moments and managed to pull all the right heart strings  impossible to dislike it 
Mar 15 2019,positive,this is a good prequel for marvel universe maybe not great enough to my expectation but definitely a good movie with a simple and logical plot and good performance of actors captain marvel fills the hole between the timeline of mcu and  explains her absence from all big events   this amazing introduction of mcu strongest hero will ensure the big role carol will reprise in avengers endgame and hopefully its succession
Mar 15 2019,negative,i was so upset i nearly cried
Mar 15 2019,negative,brie larson is actually good in the film itâtms the script which isnt
Mar 15 2019,positive,one of the best if not the best origin movie in the mcu to date
Mar 15 2019,positive,could have been soo much better but i think is ok
Mar 15 2019,negative,took way too long to get going
Mar 15 2019,positive,after all the political back and forth i decided to take an objective look at all the facts and decide for myself how i feel about this movie and im glad i did     as far as the 21 marvel cinematic films go this one ranks somewhere in the middle not bad just not one of the best ones that is by no means an insult as this is some stiff competition    i really loved the humor it reminded me of drax a few times how certain phrases can get lost in translation     the feminism and female empowerment tone was not as bad as it was made out to be it was very overtly present but not to an unrealistic degree     it wasnt  women are better than men it was more women are strong too     it portraid captain marvel prepowered similar to captain america prepowers small but scrappy strong willed in spite of physical limitations but always willing to get up abd fight no matter what    what i disliked about the film was more to do with the huge continuity errors bad lighting and jumpy action scenes     i actually felt like they could have let brie show more emotional range towards the end it made sense for her to act emotionless in the beginning of the film as part of her kree training to control her emotions but as the film progressed i would have liked to see her feelings more     her personality was on point though sarcasm abounding    im disappointed that it was not a bit better but way more disappointed that the reviews were much harsher than necessary    im not a big fan of extreme feminist ideologies or sjws myself and didnt find this movie the least bit offensive
Mar 15 2019,negative,while there were a few enjoyable moments bries acting was really off putting the story took the franchise in a direction i didnt appreciate
Mar 15 2019,positive,i really enjoyed this it was a solid superhero origin story and fun to watch really great performance from samuel l jackson
Mar 15 2019,positive,a great fun film while not earthshatteringly amazing far better than the low ratings pushed by trolls before the movie even came out
Mar 15 2019,positive,was a great overall movie and marvel origin story strong and inspiring hero and driving plot connected to the rest of the mcu great support characters and funny thereâtms really no reason to give this movie a bad review other than not liking that itâtms attempting to break down barriers and promote equality so yeah if youâtmre not into that kind of awesomeness you might not like it but for the rest of us it was a great superhero movie
Mar 15 2019,positive,there were some scenes that were a bit off   nick fury and capt marvel had instant rapport and somehow had established inside jokes   ms rambeau and her daughter werent freaked out seeing skrulls   how ms rambeaus daughter can use alien tech to change capt marvels suit color in an instant   how the skrulls were portrayed as refugees at the end but were able to effectively ambush starforce capture capt marvel and replace furys boss
Mar 15 2019,negative,barely any backstory and overall bad movie if you havent read any of the comics than this might not make sence to you
Mar 15 2019,positive,yeah it was alright loads of stuff seemed just plonked in there and complete bullshit about the avangers   its grand if u have time 2 kill but complete sh1te compared 2 nearly all over marvel movies   its not complete bollox more meh 
Mar 15 2019,positive,thought it was a great movie and definitely one of the best introduction marvel movies
Mar 15 2019,positive,not bad but not the best mcu movie that we have seen
Mar 15 2019,positive,captain marvel left me with the same feeling that age of ultron did that being whilst i enjoyed the film it could still have been better    captain marvel does have a lot going for it the cast are great both brie larson and samuel l jackson shine as carol danvers and nick fury respectively jude law and ben mendelsohn also do well as yonrogg and talos and its hard not to fall in love with goose the cat who is always sat there looking cute and provides many of the films funniest moments there is also an excellent tribute to stan lee which you would need to have a heart of stone not to be moved by    setting this in the 90s was also a great choice and is very well utilised its clear a lot of time has been spent making everything look like it is from 1995 from technology to all the different advertising that would have been seen at the time there are a few jokes that will probably go over the heads of the younger viewers but remembering the pain of waiting for a cdrom to load should raise a smile from older viewers theres also a good selection of music from the time period from nirvana to no doubt whilst it hasnt been utilised as well as in gotg and thor ragnarok the choices still fit the film well with just a girl working perfectly for part of the films final confrontation speaking of action each action sequence has been well thought out and directed and avoid becoming the blur of cgi that plagues too many cgi heavy films    so why only three and a half stars whilst captain marvel is an entertaining film it does feel a bit safe there isnt really anything here that we dont see in pretty much every scifi action film had this been a phase 1 film i would probably look at it a bit more favourably but marvel have really upped the standards in phase 3 so i was expecting a bit more than this there is also the issue of ronan the accuser as with guardians of the galaxy ronan is completely underutilised here and ultimately ends up being a complete waste of space    captain marvel is a good fun film and a worthy entry to the mcu it just isnt up there as one of its best entries
Mar 15 2019,negative,captain marvel committed the biggest sin possible for a movie it was boring good movies bad movies doesnt matter as long as their interesting and entertaining captain marvel was just bland just kinda there the worst of the mcu
Mar 15 2019,neutral,most of it is boring   captain fury was fun to watch  a small twist at the end that was interesting   but overall boring
Mar 15 2019,positive,incredible movie so many nostalgic callbacks to the 90s i enjoyed this movie from beginning to end
Mar 15 2019,negative,horrible movie waste of time and money do not watch all i saw was just a huge political agenda and bad acting
Mar 15 2019,negative,all the silly political drama aside this movie was just okay at very best definitely towards the bottom of the mcu movies it caused all kinds of extra continuity errors to the mcu apparently the writers and directors didnt do better homework on the marvel mythos also when every cast member besides the actual star of the film is getting praise that should be a red flag movies fun enough i guess but the mcu and avengers endgame really didnt need it perhaps would have even been better without it
Mar 15 2019,positive,2 origin stories in 1 with a retro feel and a couple big laughs top 20 mcu but not top 10 it does tie in nicely with the extended universe plot
Mar 15 2019,positive,great movie i love it 
Mar 15 2019,positive,it was amazing and perfectly tied to the mcu
Mar 15 2019,negative,bland the most generic of all mcu films to date not a bad movie just boring
Mar 15 2019,negative,it was alright the film wasnt exactly horrible but not quite the groundbreaker it was claimed to be some of the acting wasnt great and the way the treated samuel jackson was embarassing not the worst marvel movie but not one ill be seeing again
Mar 15 2019,negative,worst movie by marvel
Mar 15 2019,negative,i didnt enjoy the movie  it was boring tbh
Mar 15 2019,positive,my son and i loved this movie its a must see
Mar 15 2019,positive,its not going to rewrite the super hero genre but it is a great movie with some empowering moments for the female community
Mar 15 2019,positive,carol is helplessly overpowered but the story is interesting the characters are sympathetic and well portraied and goose is amazing
Mar 15 2019,negative,i liked the way it started but as it went on it got a bit boring i didnt like the way they explained furies eye and carrels actress was very meh i liked the skrulls a lot but the emotional moments felt undeserved all in all of the weaker marvel movies
Mar 15 2019,negative,im sure this will get deleted like the 50 thousand others they deleted so save your money unless you want to be disappointed plain and simple
Mar 15 2019,positive,great movie with a good back story and funny moments  one of the better mcu hits
Mar 15 2019,neutral,launched before endgame but failed to impress the regular audience
Mar 15 2019,negative,are you serious with this not only was it just a boring movie overall the fact that theyve released the new endgame trailer just to help this film is pretty pathetic
Mar 15 2019,negative,is a ok film to see at least once
Mar 15 2019,negative,movie was bad it feels like it was made by people who had not taken the time to watch and understand the mcu larson work with what she was given seem a little wooden half of the time also the captain america movie seem to be thrown out the window for him being the first avenger 
Mar 15 2019,negative,the movie is really bland if it wasnâtmt for nick fury and the cat i wouldnâtmt even be giving it half a star
Mar 15 2019,positive,was ok  was hoping for it to be better  assuming the second one will be better 
Mar 15 2019,positive,not only was this movie great as a standalone origin film but it also worked well in fleshing out the marvel universe as well as building significant hype for endgame brie larson and samuel l jackson stole the show with a mix of believable emotive acting combined with welltimed genuinely funny comedy my only real big criticism of this movie is the pacing the first 1025 minutes seemed long and drawn out due to the slow pace meaning the remaining portion of the film seemed far to quick as a result due to the contrast of pace  overall a great movie and for me personally one of the strongest mcu movies not only in recent history but overall  well worth a watch
Mar 15 2019,negative,unfortunately bland people always say how goose the cat was the highlight i thought the cat was only decent which says a lot about the film as a whole
Mar 15 2019,negative,i think this was a missed opportunity i think this could of added to the mcu  forthcoming endgame but when you simply cant connect with the lead character then you dont invest that emotional tie
Mar 15 2019,positive,im the kind of person who cant sit through a movie without a brief interlude maybe go check my phone that kind of thing i never really rush to get back thinking that ill just watch it again when it comes out when i had to use the restroom during captain marvel i sprinted fullspeed there and back and nearly broke my neck trying to get back to my seat as fast as possible    i havent laughed this hard during a movie in a long time the action scenes are awesome the cat is adorable and carols little smirk and quips are the only reasons you need to go see this movie
Mar 15 2019,positive,captain marvel is a great preperation for the upcoming massive showdown avengers endgame altough the movie struggles with its action scenes in the beginning its more of a fight catching the audience rather than catching the skrulls at a time captain marvel lights up and gives the audience entertaining action scenes and funny jokes everyone who wants to see the upcoming avengers endgame movie should consider watching it
Mar 15 2019,negative,captain marvel is one huge mess it feels like a jumbled conglomerate of a few movies that blantantly ripoff other far better movies such as the guardians of the galaxy franchise  the cinematography especially when captain marvel first comes to earth makes your eyes sore the tone jumps seemingly randomly from extreme to extreme and the writing is just awful
Mar 15 2019,positive,a great action packed adventure filled orgin story of a hero fighting to unlock the secrets to her past in order to save the future i would definitely see this again and again and again on par with captain america the first avenger a thrill ride from beginning to end
Mar 15 2019,positive,absolutely transitional movie but cat and coulson was good
Mar 15 2019,negative,im a woman and i simply cannot take politics in entertainment any longer avoid like the plague
Mar 15 2019,positive,enjoyed it quite a bit satisfying fun movie allround
Mar 15 2019,positive,great story line lots of action as in all marvel films  nice addition to the superhero roster  remember to stay to the very end
Mar 15 2019,negative,an origin story like no other this is green lantern wasted my money
Mar 15 2019,positive,great back story to marvel universe no complaints would def see it again great movie no reason notto likekt u less youre a douchebag hater
Mar 15 2019,negative,good cgi sometimes good scenerycamera quality bad acting bad script generic cringe inducing and boring the marvel formula continues to be a depressing fact of the mcu
Mar 15 2019,negative,second worst marvel movie 
Mar 15 2019,negative,captain marvel comes with all the spectacle youd expect from a marvel movie and its great to see the first female lead of the mcu  but it just doesnt deliver  the captains powers dont feel earnt but she comes out of the gate knowing how to near instantly how to use them  surely there could have been a been a better plot device than the much overused memory loss doesnt really feel like carol owns her growth but regresses to her old self as bits of her memory return  feel like it stunt her characters growth arc she starts super power and ends up overpowered  hopefully shell grow on us with her inclusion in other mcu movies
Mar 15 2019,positive,brie larson did a splendid job for her role in captain marvel especially how this is her first big role in the mcu samuel l jackson and the rest of the cast did a fantastic job too with better dialogues and facial expression from brie this movie should be up in my top 5 list and would get a 5 star
Mar 15 2019,positive,incredibly fun film mysterious and fresh
Mar 15 2019,negative,worst marvelmovie ever worst main charakter you can absolutely not buy into it also did they not learn anything from justice leauge it is so super stupid to have 1 overpowered over the top hero it will ruin the dynamic of avengers in endgame brie did not even get one scratch in the lolish fights  in this movie this is so stupid
Mar 15 2019,neutral,it wasnt as awful as i expected it wasnt great though the entire timeline is messed up and nick fury is a completely different character
Mar 15 2019,positive,great movie and good lead into avengers endgame
Mar 15 2019,negative,went in assuming i was going to like this movie as i have most every marvel film this far but left feeling completely underwhelmed slow at times with some pacing issuesmy dad even fell asleep at one point i kept waiting to be entertained which seemed to never happen and when i felt entertained it didnt last long or was ruined by some poor writing decision not bad but not up to the bar that is set for a marvel studios film 
Mar 15 2019,positive,she is not a skinny supermodel in a slinky overexposing sexy dressshe is an air force pilot with a rebel attitude its feminism galore at the right time but its not opportunistic and its original its simply marvel in tune with what they always champion for great movie
Mar 15 2019,negative,marvel fatigue makes this film just another origin story out of what seems like dozens of others that are either just as good or better
Mar 15 2019,positive,it was good on par with the rest of the mcu strayed from the comic a bit but so long as you keep in mind its a separate universe its not bad i look forward to seeing how she adds to endgame
Mar 15 2019,positive,great movie i see all the fuss about the bad reviews and all that but you cant let that get in the way are you going to see the movie because its a great introduction movie people forget that its an introduction movie and they want to expect more than what theyre getting which is stupid because the movie did its job
Mar 15 2019,negative,saw the movie last night and i was very unimpressed i love the mcu and am a huge comic book fan but this movie was unwanted by any fan and was just a general disappointment of a movie forgettable movie overall and forgettable fight scenes not very good acting from the main actress story telling was messy jump cuts were rough and the forcefulness of feminism was very unwanted and in the nose wonder woman did it better in every way and without the controversy rotten tomatoes will probably delete this review to protect this movie for some reason unfortunately
Mar 15 2019,negative,not worth the price of admission 
Mar 15 2019,negative,not a very good marvel movie i was not impressed i regret paying to watch this movie
Mar 15 2019,neutral,its a good movie made me laugh a few times but its not a good marvel movie nor a good superhero movie its an op character movie throughout the movie the only time she truly struggled was when she had her powers taken from her and then about 10 seconds later got them back the visuals are gorgeous the acting is great but they made danvers a bit snarky and not the good type of snarky overall if you dont care about the mcu watch it if you do i might recommend giving it a pass
Mar 15 2019,positive,really enjoyed it solid origin story cant wait to see cap marvel in avengers endgame
Mar 15 2019,negative,not a great movie stick to the old ones
Mar 15 2019,positive,its answered the questions that needed to be answered  some of the answers to those questions i did not like but all in all it was a solid movie not a home run but not every movie is a home run
Mar 15 2019,positive,the movie is perfectly fine brie is great as captain marvel people just bring too much of their own opinions about the actress and prehating the movie get over it
Mar 15 2019,negative,i wanted to leave this movie so bad but i stayed because of the comfy recliner 
Mar 15 2019,positive,as a teen i wanted so badly to be a fighter pilot my hopes and dreams were dashed by a navy recruiter who didnt lie to me shocker i know and told me id have to grow at least 6 inches to be considered and that was the end of my dream of being a fighter pilot eventually i took classes to become a helicopter pilot and then sadly those dreams were dashed by cancer     but i still love to think back on those amazing dreams and this movie was like dream porn to me seeing women flying experimental planes and doing it so badass i wish there had been a lot more dog fighting and trick flying actually but i still think this movie was fantastic and i cant wait to share it with my daughter she never wanted to be a pilot but she is still a badass woman
Mar 15 2019,positive,i grow up in the 90s and this film was a great flash back with lots of action and just the right mix of humor
Mar 15 2019,positive,fun movie a welcome addition to the mcu
Mar 15 2019,positive,good not great as an origin movie they did well good graphics and plenty of laughs 
Mar 15 2019,negative,captain marvel which seems pretty far outside of the superhero cannon seems to heavily rely on a throwback setting odd catcreatures and some impressive samuel l jackson cgi for its wow factor however considering the story and acting alone it falls very short the movie seemed to be slapped in between avenger movies for some quick cash and i regret seeing it to stay informed i should have let an online video catch me up instead of paying for a ticket
Mar 15 2019,negative,i found it very boring
Mar 15 2019,positive,it was even better the second time watching 
Mar 15 2019,positive,it had its originality could have done with bigger battles
Mar 15 2019,positive,awesome character had a really great storyline
Mar 15 2019,positive,very good origin story enjoyed seeing a young fury and colson brie larson was terrific 
Mar 15 2019,positive,i went in hoping to be entertained for 2 hours and thats exactly what i got its not the best of the mcu movies but definitely not the worst its pretty light in tone and furycarol have good comedic banter there are plenty of easter eggs for hardcore fans but enough surface level story for casual viewers it introduces an extremely powerful hero that the avengers are gonna need
Mar 15 2019,negative,weak plot poor character development one of de weakest movies in the mcu
Mar 15 2019,negative,boring plot main character black panther is 100 times better
Mar 15 2019,negative,words cannot express how disappointing this film was not awful just disappointing i understand its a different universe from cannon but how can one film get so much wrong
Mar 15 2019,neutral,the movie was ok i would suggest saving your money and waiting for it to come out on netflix
Mar 15 2019,positive,i think we need more movies liek this it was great movie not just for women but men too i thought i was light when it needed to be a serious enough to keep it going as a long time marvel comic reader i was most surprised by how they handle the skrulls iâtmm this movie but i loved it
Mar 15 2019,positive,the movie is amazing and i just say i really enjoyed it  cant wait to see her on avengersendgame
Mar 15 2019,positive,it feels like independence day meets guardians of the galaxy meets a buddy cop movie thumbs up
Mar 15 2019,positive,amazing movie love it must watch â
Mar 15 2019,positive,this movie was great it is an origin so it does have its slow moments but you have to get to know the character if you havent read the comics i do think its worth seeing especially if your like me and cant wait for the avengers
Mar 15 2019,negative,there is less to lack of heros journey in story many feminist and suppressing of men references the only good thing in movie was vfx and skrulls twist
Mar 15 2019,negative,i hate her acting  good story just needs another actress
Mar 15 2019,negative,already been done with previous films this was was just done in a very boring generic lazy casting direction scrip villain etc anyways looking forward to avengers endgame oh and this is the 4th time that i try to post this review but it mysteriously keeps getting removed hmmm i wonder why
Mar 15 2019,negative,and im being nice this is the most boring movie from marvel so far 
Mar 15 2019,negative,bri was aweful sam was awesome jude was not enough
Mar 15 2019,positive,was not near a bad as early views said but was several times were i started playing in my phone why aliens are using earth lingo  i have no clue give it a solid 4 start and will see it again to find things i missed maybe i will like it better on 2nd run
Mar 15 2019,positive,i loved this movie very enjoyable to watch
Mar 15 2019,positive,good fun movie better than you think it is definitely worth seeing dont pay attention to the fake reviews 
Mar 15 2019,positive,not a perfect movie some of the action scenes were on the nose but it was just so awesome to see a solo female superhero movie in the mcu super fun
Mar 15 2019,positive,captain marvel is a fun marvel movie     the cast are very entertaining     i love the facts seeing the guardians of the galaxy characters in the film and see them together with carol danvers     its feel like a phase one mcu film i love to see more of carol and coulson
Mar 15 2019,positive,after experiencing a bit of superhero movie fatigue not bothering to go see the latest 1015 or so movies in this genre not even infinity war which i regret now i went to see this movie with really no expectations good or bad also not being very familiar with the characters named captain marvel but happy i did cause i loved the way it didnt follow the traditional origin story thats been done to death now and that it was dancing to its own 90s beatoh and on the second viewing it was even better knowing how all the pieces of the puzzle fit together
Mar 15 2019,positive,exactly what i thought it would be spectacular
Mar 15 2019,positive,better than black panther 
Mar 15 2019,negative,lack luster character from bre uses intense hard characters from other films in a funny weak way to try and increase how impressive the main character is  story is lacking a real opposition or moment of doubt that the hero might succeed  feels a bit pandering to 90s and female empowerment and the story and character development really feels it in a sad way  wanted to love it but came in sad about the product 
Mar 15 2019,positive,great movie overall  but some silly mistakes
Mar 15 2019,positive,im giving this movie 4 stars because it was a good movie but not 5 star marvel i look at this as just an intro the fun 5star stuff will be all of the gang together 
Mar 15 2019,negative,boring predictable lazy insulting
Mar 15 2019,positive,iâtmd like to say this is the best marvel hero i like
Mar 15 2019,positive,great addition to the mcu and was everything that was expected for this origin 
Mar 15 2019,negative,its an okay film but it fails live up to all the hype that heavy advertisement generated    to me the biggest flaw to me is carol being is being bland or maybe unrelatable character   she does not any flaws or weaknesses and barely any personality  essentially shes unbeatable which makes the movie predictable kind of like older superman stories where he was literally unbeatable    at some point in the movie i started theorizing if she actually fused with the reactors technology rather than just absorbing its power and became partially android which would make her betterstronger in many ways but less emotional and possibly susceptible to some sort of emp attacks i expected the enemies to figure it out and use it against her but by the end of the movie i realized that she just that excellent    the story kind of explores missing memories to add a twist to the backstory but doesnt really take it anywhere interesting i was hoping to see some sort of a plot twist when her memories come back or at least some sort of a mystery that would add to the character building    if this is how this character is supposed to be and not just bad directing i dont think i am interested in it     the goose was really intriguing it barely makes a few appearances but it already has mystery and character to it so i hope it appears more in later movies
Mar 15 2019,negative,i wanted this movie to be good dispite everything i heard before going this was by far the worst marvel movie yet its only competition was the hulk movie from 2008 the plot was weak humor was uncharacteristicly lackluster and it didnt do even the smallest hint of justice to the source material samuel jackson was great but he was kinda washed over by the other flood of unlikeable characters caption marvel was pretty bad all around the worst acting from a main character in a marvel film bar none   this is all to say nothing of the fact that the film shoved girl power down your throat literally the whole film for no reason hopefully this character will not ruin end game dispite the fact that she was so bad in her own film
Mar 15 2019,positive,âaction   âcomedy  âstoryline   and also connecting a few dots in the mysteries of the marvel universe loved it  would definetely recommend to watch
Mar 15 2019,positive,an empowering movie for women and men of all ages i really enjoyed the film the special effects sent chills up my spine and larson did a great job being the unapologetic captain marvel  only critique is that the plot line was a little hard to follow at times especially for first time mcu people but that was almost offset by its originality not to mention samuel l jacksonâtms comic relief
Mar 15 2019,positive,brie is awesome in the role the movie is fun it has the best stan lee cameo so far and its an excellent appetizer for the upcoming avengers 4
Mar 15 2019,positive,solid marvel flick kind of doesnt fit with the rest of the films but it was entertaining
Mar 15 2019,negative,out of all the marvel movies ive seenthis misses hard i will not be seeing this again
Mar 15 2019,positive,good storming likeable characters  id watch it a second time
Mar 15 2019,neutral,the movie overall is fun to watch especially by the side characters the intro was fun to watch captain marvel fighting her way out of the enemies hand a bit silly on certain executions which didnt seem to blend well with the tone no real concern for the main character the villain appearance was a cliche along with a miss opportunity to create a more compelling villain their is a feminist message within the movie but its not throughout the entire film or too heavy handed the main character as i stated i didnt feel her character on the light or humorous scenes either from words or her facial talking marks of squint raised eyebrow etc she shines on the more heavy parts of the film it seems the main character is truly revealed during those scenes not all but a solid 90 of heavy scenes were good did all the scenes made sense no but it was delivered well its a fun marvel movie but it is not one of the greatest mcu film movie theater level when no other good films are out and you want to go see a movie out of theater level purchase is ok rental is more worthy 
Mar 15 2019,positive,it was a good movie  not the best marvel movie  a good one nevertheless
Mar 15 2019,negative,i wanted this to be a good movie i wanted it to be another gem in the mcu crown  however its lacking in many areas  captain marvel is a very 1dimensional character with no growth or development  her acting is sadly very wodden if this is due to directing or actors choice i dont know  the colour pallet is very dark and almost monochromatic something that along with the often very poor choice of lighting and cinematography makes some fight scenes almost unwatchable  we all know the one scene where the choice of music would make anyone faceplam  the deaging process used of some of the actors is pretty jarring at points seems that they switch between decent cg decent make up to rushed and frankly bad 90s cg and make up most of the jokes if you can call them that fall flat    i wanted this to be a good movie but i was very disappointed  come on marvel pick up your game you can do better than this
Mar 15 2019,negative,this film was horrible i dont care how much money it makes it was boring  showed nothing of what a real superhero is the mcu always does this provide quantity over quality
Mar 15 2019,positive,really good movie better the wonder woman great story line
Mar 15 2019,positive,great movie didnt feel like a social issue was being pushed in my face just another good marvel movie ready to see captain marvel in avengers endgame 
Mar 15 2019,negative,this was an uninteresting superhero movie  it felt like a rough early phase mcu story not a character that is going to help determine the direction of the universe going forward  all this movie did was make me grateful for current internet speeds  also nice job trying to ruin nick fury as a bad  character
Mar 15 2019,positive,great movie loved the origin story and cantmt wait to see more of her
Mar 14 2019,positive,one of my favorites movies ever
Mar 14 2019,positive,have no idea whos giving negative reviews for this movie very entertaining
Mar 14 2019,negative,the movie just sucks in almost every shape and form i think marvel wouldve done better if they did a rocket racoon and groot movie
Mar 14 2019,negative,sorry to say but this was a terrible experience i wasted 2 hours of my life 
Mar 14 2019,negative,just a huge cringe fest for the majority of the film i was like ughh plz marvel if ur gonna keep her in the mcu at least make her more interesting in the future movies plz or im done so much disappointed 
Mar 14 2019,negative,not nearly as good as expected  super slow incomplete story background useless character development
Mar 14 2019,positive,i loved captain marvel her character is unique and will be a lot of fun to blend in with the rest of the avengers the movie is actionpacked and its definitely better the second time i was able to relax and enjoy the humor of the movie captain marvel is quite likable as a person and she showed great traits as a hero 5 stars
Mar 14 2019,negative,meh poor storyline bad performances but great special fx
Mar 14 2019,negative,does not apply to my expectations 15 marvel humor 15 comics sense 35 if this new vision of our time
Mar 14 2019,negative,boring very slow fury eye patch story sucked
Mar 14 2019,negative,the movie is really fun  with manny references of the 90s and the mcubut brie larson is puted aside by nick furry and that fantastic alien cat the problem of the movie is the plot errors and some times is political biasedthat is something no one likes stop politicizing hero movies cmon over all it is a mediocre movie that does not represent marvelhopefully disney is not going to do that again the thuth is ï 12 12 12 12 12everybody just whachted this movie because of end game and it is nothing more than a really normalmedium origin movie
Mar 14 2019,positive,although a weaker title within the marvel canon captain marvel is still able to hold a certain charm to it combined with the amazing chemistry of the leads and comfortable twists to keep you watching
Mar 14 2019,negative,no even close on who she is in the comics shes not even close to being powerful as thor and the hulk bunch of bs
Mar 14 2019,neutral,just nothing really amazing normal perfermance as a marvel movie but with very bad actor choice
Mar 14 2019,negative,really bad acting and as a marvel comic fan super annoyed that they totally changed skruls
Mar 14 2019,positive,after watching a few of marvel series this movie definitely not one of my favorites the story is soso not the most interesting the twist in the movie isnt that surprise either the fighting scenes a alright not as powerful as the other super heroes of course there is no real ending because there is always to be continued for the next movie will i watch the next movie yes because a few of my favorite super heroes are coming back
Mar 14 2019,positive,8510 well done entertaining with a good message as well as a good tie in to the rest of the movies i highly recommend it
Mar 14 2019,positive,good film good cast easy to follow for those new to the marvel universe 
Mar 14 2019,negative,marvel missed their mark with movie the movie weak and emotionally disconnected
Mar 14 2019,positive,a thoroughly fun movie  had no one dead i would like it so much
Mar 14 2019,positive,first of all this was the movie guys  this was the movie that had the tribute to stan lee  lets take a moment of silence for stan  they gave him the whole intro they did it right    the movie waswell very good  it seemed sometimes a little too nostalgic  it wanted to shove the idea of omg its the 90s down our throats a bit  blockbuster radio shack nirvana gwen stefaniit was all a bit heavyhanded  i felt it detracted    as far as the story and im trying to keep this spoilerfree i enjoyed it  i like how it flipped the evil dichotomy  the questionable characters you meet at the beginning are later given the roles you expect of them  it was pretty smooth    as far as the feminist agenda eyeroll it was great  it wasnt as great as wonder woman sorry brie but lets give dc one movie that comes out on top right    overall it was a great addition to the mcu  now if you will excuse me im going to get a cat and name it after a top gun reference
Mar 14 2019,negative,seems like a phase 1 movie just a month before the conclusion of the greatest event in the mcu
Mar 14 2019,negative,is it ok if i thought it was boring
Mar 14 2019,positive,not perfect but pretty dang good there are pacing issues in the beginning but i loved the call backs to certain things and the loved how they did the skrull especially talos  i didnt expect that but it was just dope to see  how they put so legit social issues as an inherent part to the plot loved brie larson looking forward to her role in the next marvel film
Mar 14 2019,positive,you will like it as long as your not tucker carlsons biggest fan
Mar 14 2019,neutral,good but not great pretty much your basic introductory marvel movie
Mar 14 2019,negative,garbage compared to other movies in the mcu donâtmt bother with it
Mar 14 2019,negative,really confusing and flat story explanation could have done betterwill not watch it again anytime soon
Mar 14 2019,negative,definitely not great
Mar 14 2019,negative,this movie didnt deserve my money
Mar 14 2019,positive,i think it was good just not great
Mar 14 2019,positive,dont listen to the misogynistic haters this is a fun movie and definitely fits into the marvel universe quite well brie larsen is great and she kicks a as captain marvel 
Mar 14 2019,positive,great movie my daughter and i loved everything about it itâtms got action humor great backstory iâtmm taking my husband tomorrow higher further faster baby you go girl
Mar 14 2019,negative,slow boring preachy basically 2 hours of my life wasted and cant get back 
Mar 14 2019,negative,this character is so blahher acting is boring 
Mar 14 2019,neutral,captain marvel is a very average mcu film it isnt very good but its far from a bad movie captain marvel will fit in bed well with the rest of the mcu characters
Mar 14 2019,negative,was a nick fury and goose the cat movie carrol danvers was missing a script or story or talent it wasnt very good compared to all the other mcu films im
Mar 14 2019,negative,samuel l jackson is the only redeeming factor the film is rushed and boring brie larsons snarky attitude and unique brand of sarcasm comes off as unpleasant and her character cold as a female i was hoping to see a powerful representation of my sex in captain marvel but was greatly let down the role of danvers should have been given to an actress that could hold a candle to rdj the trailers advertised find out what makes her a hero i left the theater still wondering the same    i worry about how this poorly developed character that lacks superhero quality with fit into endgame
Mar 14 2019,positive,a fun time at the movie for the whole family
Mar 14 2019,positive,beginning drags just a bit and it doesnt do anything different like black panther but the film still hours the mark using the marvel formula definitely a good movie for young girls as well bri larson does a great job in the second half giving her character complexity
Mar 14 2019,positive,great movie and i was a huge skeptic going in she was kind of a bad ass in the end nice job making her really strong 
Mar 14 2019,negative,it was a decent movie but far from the marvel courseit introduces way to many plot holes and contradictions in the mcu  overall it was a good popcorn flick but nothing special
Mar 14 2019,negative,worst marvel movie ever i have watched it in theater and is so boring and nothing intersting about it also if u gonna me movie make it with out any agenda and make it wiht good story line and good quality acting not just to send a messege out wasted my my money regrets
Mar 14 2019,positive,5 stars will write a review when i have time
Mar 14 2019,neutral,mediocre in the mcu realm 
Mar 14 2019,negative,i was underwhelmed by this movie the script and direction of the movie did the actors no favors the movie seemed to drag on honestly i felt bored before the final fight scene i typically see most marvel movies 23 times in theaters but one time is enough for this film i think brie did a good job however i wish they would have worked in some more self deprecating jokes a la the last thor movie all the snarky comments without anyone saying anything made her character seem a bit stuckup overall a good movie in most cases but a disappointment for marvel considering their last several movies 
Mar 14 2019,positive,fun movie its a break from the norm for marvel but full of entertainment
Mar 14 2019,negative,horrible lighting made the movie hard to see and even appreciate her best friend     much less anything else in the movie
Mar 14 2019,positive,the action is fine but with another uninteresting vilian and humor that just doesnt land as often as it should this is definitely on the bottom teir of marvel movies hopefully the character can be redeemed and given some room to grow into a better character in the following marvel phases because the potential is there
Mar 14 2019,neutral,it was an okay filler of a movie between the more epic saga stories of the main story arc  the positive is that there is a new character to the mcu now and there is some potential in my opinion marvel needs to be careful with how strategic they are with this character      unfortunately in this movie every other character was more interesting than captain marvel herself  sam jackson and the skrulls delivered the comedic relief the rest was heavy handed with the special effects which actually took away from the movie  i liked the cat more    captain marvel was hard to like within the movie  the character was way overpowered within the story and im not sure they built a solid enough foundation  it feels like this character is coming in from left field where theres been a decade of character development with the other characters  i think there was also a likeability factor with this character  she was a bit flat lacked humor and was almost inspirational    i think in the end they spent too much time and money on the visuals and not enough developing this character  its like they need a prequel now when maybe they should have done that first and then have a movie like this would have made it connect more  this is where i think the early mcu did well they focused on character development with captain america and iron man and then started stitching them together    i dont think this is a case of movie fatigue i think people will go see these every month if one came out but they need to give audiences a reason to care about this characters then they can have a visual filler inbetween  you cant start with a visual movie for a character thats so crazy powerful  and the best answer you give is reasons
Mar 14 2019,positive,fun movie to watch great addition to the marvel cinematic universe along with introducing a great new character the movie also gives nick furysamuel jackson more of a role  their on screen chemistry was enjoyable definitely recommend seeing it
Mar 14 2019,positive,this movie was great all the elements that you expect from a marvel movie are present and my two daughters appreciated the female lead despite the initial reluctance my son ended up enjoying it as well
Mar 14 2019,negative,diddnt really like it   was like semi watching it diddnt get me hooked like the other marvel movies
Mar 14 2019,negative,really predictable and mostly by the numbers movie with no character development of the lead along with a story that seems like its a whole bunch  of ideas used in search of a suitable ending i along with the rest of the theatre audience really was unimpressed and most felt relief when the movie ended marvels first vanilla movie to be sure wasnt horriblewasnt all that good either
Mar 14 2019,negative,its ok cool action stuff but bland story 
Mar 14 2019,positive,was awesome love the character and how she grows also goose did a great job
Mar 14 2019,positive,excellent top 5 mcu movie for me probably just over thor ragnarok and just under gotg1 and infinity war
Mar 14 2019,positive,amazing movie loved it
Mar 14 2019,positive,fun enjoyed the backstory on furys eye and the avengers
Mar 14 2019,neutral,after hearing all the negative reviews i went in with lower expectations and the movie was close to what i thought i like all mcu movies but this one is unfortunately probably in my bottom 5 id give it a 5 or 6 out of 10 not terrible but not good either
Mar 14 2019,positive,on par with all other marvel origin films which is a feat considering how much they had to cover to get ready for end game 
Mar 14 2019,positive,it was alright worth checking out but personally i expected a bombastic out of this world depiction of captain marvel since shes like the the most powerful again see this movie before endgame and really enjoyed the 90s music
Mar 14 2019,positive,solid upper third of the mcu fury and goose were fun carols character is pretty repressed for much of the movie but as her character loosens up and shows more humor it brings it all together talos is one of the mcus best villains the music felt forced and didnt click the way it does for the guardians movies
Mar 14 2019,positive,very inspirational great cast a must see 
Mar 14 2019,positive,such a fun movie exceeded my expectations looking forward to more captain marvel
Mar 14 2019,positive,safe content but smooth story telling
Mar 14 2019,positive,i really enjoyed this movie it was funny fast paced energetic and even briefly emotional i think most of the hate is coming from people who made up their minds before they ever even saw it two of my friends were pessimists going in and complained on the way out even though they were laughing and enjoying themselves and the movie the entire time     i will agree that it was a little weird seeing a hero so powerful pretty much right off the bat and only grow stronger from there but i feel like this is just a nitpick about the direction some things could have been done better other things were done perfectly its pretty balanced the important thing is that i enjoyed the movie a lot and i will happily watch it again and again over the years as i savor the wonder that is the marvel cinematic universe
Mar 14 2019,positive,in a preiron man world this would have been stellar however it lacks the action and humor to stand out in todays world and as far as female heroes go wonder woman did it better captain marvel lacks personality and charisma the movies biggest flaw is that it spends so much time treading water with its plot it could have easily been 20 to 30 minutes shorter and been a much tighter and engaging story it is not a bad movie but it is not a great movie either it is mediocre it is perhaps the worst movie in the mcu however a franchise in which mediocrity is as bad as it ever gets 
Mar 14 2019,negative,did not like this movie the highlight was seeing stan lee in his regular cameo  captain marvel had no character development but is all of a sudden the answer to all the avengers problems
Mar 14 2019,positive,i knew nothing about this character going in but enjoyed the twists and turns in the telling of her story just enough action to be exciting and enough character development to keep it interesting 
Mar 14 2019,positive,a decent movie hampered by a clumsy start a weak ending and an unfocused protagonist very powerful scenes around the midpoint and has a great villain
Mar 14 2019,negative,it was blah this movie was base on the 1990s but they didnt show much of the 90s and could of been done in the 2000s and people wouldnt carefor me its the worst marvel movie 
Mar 14 2019,negative,jawn sucked i couldnt wait for it to be over brie larson was boring with no emotion 
Mar 14 2019,positive,loved it gonna go see it again 
Mar 14 2019,negative,boring at times but not the worst movie ever
Mar 14 2019,negative,it was bad the main character was horrible her acting left much to be desired i love samuel jackson and even his cgi character was meh i usually hate hearing criticsreviews talk about pc storylines but this movie was chalked full of it so much that it muddled the storyline im all for diversity in films and representation but this overshadowed the whole point of the film its a comic book movie they should have focused on keeping it on task her character was so bad im actually dreading seeing her in end game hoping her role isnt too big i liked the shout out to stan lee which is why i gave it one star and the lead skrull was funny he and samuel jackson along with carol danvers best friend were the highlight actors ugh please get rid of bree larson or captain marvel altogether 
Mar 14 2019,positive,i expect a certain kind of movie when i go to a marvel film captain marvel fully delivers thatplus some really unexpected and poignant moments about the female experience i love how it explored the power of supportive female friendships without turning anything into a romantic relationship i got more than i expected and i left with a smile
Mar 14 2019,positive,i think this movie is good and it introduces very well a new character 
Mar 14 2019,positive,without giving away the plot all i am willing to say is that this movie is pretty solidpredictable  and filled with 1990s fun but the plot has more impact the less you know about the marvel universe which is sad because alot of the jokes are funnier the more you know about the marvel universe its good but at the end of the day its just another marvel character introduction
Mar 14 2019,positive,great origins movie dont listen to the trolls and fake reviews watch for yourself very entertaining
Mar 14 2019,neutral,the parts of the movie i liked almost made up for all the parts i didnt not to mention the leftist preachy overtone and anticlimatic scenes honestly the movie felt like a rough draft
Mar 14 2019,positive,i enjoyed this movie
Mar 14 2019,negative,an average at best marvel movie messes with established lore within the mcu and falls short of being decent giving it a low score as i know marvel studios is capable of making higher quality movies
Mar 14 2019,neutral,im not sure what the fuss is about this movie was ok at best the middle was to slow it was just too broken up i do look forward to seeing her in endgame hope shes better
Mar 14 2019,negative,weve had enough of the same formula for marvel movies    youll feel like youve seen it  wouldve been great 7 years ago now its just a messed up girl who cant do anything wrong
Mar 14 2019,neutral,was an ok movie not too good but not too bad either the villains werent that convincing and i never felt that captain marvel was ever in any danger and defeated the vilains way too easily although i liked nick fury as a character in the film i feel the script didnt feel up to par with how his character acted in the past films over all i enjoyed the movie but only felt like a filler movie
Mar 14 2019,negative,was looking forward to seeing the movie went opening day and the whole family was let down definitely a let down as far as action goes
Mar 14 2019,positive,solid movie cool references good action and story not quite 5 stars but a great flick
Mar 14 2019,positive,lots of fun good writing of the female characters probably my favorite marvel movie
Mar 14 2019,negative,this is the first movie i dare to write a review about so bear with me its annoyingly dull doesnt fit the other marvel movies at all the story has holes bigger than the grand canyon basically nothing gets resolved tessaract is used so stupidly breaking continuity with a trucksized sledgehammer its just a very lowerthanmediocre experience
Mar 14 2019,positive,solid mcu addition does not deserve the hate its getting captain marvel is incredibly powerful excited to see how she helps in avengers endgame ignore people that are hating on the actress or because its a positive empowering movie for women its a really good movie 
Mar 14 2019,positive,brie larson a captain marvel is such badass loved the visual and action
Mar 14 2019,positive,this movie was glorious best marvel film ive ever seen hands down seeing brie larson steal that bike was a fantasy come to life and goose was adorable
Mar 14 2019,negative,instead can we get a fury and goose film  that would be way better than this
Mar 14 2019,positive,this movie was amazing i dont understand everyone is hating on it it was an empowering amazing all around exciting movie with a message that can really help young girls i dont believe that they compromised her femininity but yet represented the women who are not as feminine as society imagines they should be just because a female character doesnt fit your standard of how feminine the said character should be doesnt mean that they are not an accurate representation of women also to everyone saying that no one actually goes through the oppression that she went through as a child and her adult life youre wrong as a woman i have went through that pretty much since i was 7 people told me i couldnt play baseball or basketball even though i was good at both anyway i feel like the people that dont like the feminist tones of this movie are just not used to seeing a beloved female character who doesnt have on some sort of sexy outfit or isnt feminine enough thats all it was a great movie
Mar 14 2019,neutral,was not as  bad as everyone claimed it was however it certainly was not as good as claimed either  all politics and ajendas aside as it always should be its one of the lower end mcu offerings non captivating origin story that felt rushed and never managed to pull me in till the very end
Mar 14 2019,positive,very good why the critics are that bad
Mar 14 2019,positive,i was disheartened by previous ratings but glad to know they were a cheap trick and rotten tomatoes was on top of it i saw it today with my 11 year old daughter and we absolutely loved it was it perfect no but i found it humorous without being cheesy i always love seeing a female heroine and seeing fury with both eyes was fun too my daughter left the theater ready to kick butt she felt empowered to see a female heroine as well ill quote her captain marvel is such a boss lol we cant wait to see avengers end game
Mar 14 2019,positive,ok wonâtmt own it better than expected not much humor or cast spark but it was good
Mar 14 2019,positive,i liked it a whole lot  sure it is different than the comic origins but it did not detract from it at all  i liked the structure and the fact that the danvers character arc was logical and progressed  i especially liked the talos character even though the skrulls are different than the books  the mcu is not the comics and vice versa  i look forward to seeing her develop in the coming movies
Mar 14 2019,negative,not good not bad entirely boring except a few parts at the end
Mar 14 2019,positive,saw it sunday at a laemmle liked it a lot although i wish there was more of a story line  the haters should get over themselves larson was good and it was fun seeing bening and law
Mar 14 2019,positive,i believe the low audience rating is due to peoples belief that this pushes the equality idea i personally found the movie very good and is an excellent introduction for having more diverse avengers in the future
Mar 14 2019,neutral,just ok not great but not awful
Mar 14 2019,positive,great film i thought it would be awkward and cringy but it was well done i look forward to avengers endgame
Mar 14 2019,positive,pretty good through 23 final act falls a little flat never felt like there was really any doubt to the outcome captain marvel is a little too overpowered leads to the superman problem you need to have threat of failure to appreciate the success
Mar 14 2019,negative,one star for being a marvel movie and another for the catflerkin  the worst marvel movie propably of all timehighly disappointed with the senseless story line and slow boring screenplay
Mar 14 2019,neutral,it was a serviceable film that had entertaining moments but blatantly ignored years of preestablished continuity and attempts to rewrite history to have the mcu revolve around captain marvel its worth a view but dont expect greatness 
Mar 14 2019,negative,marvel is usually very good but this one was lacking except in special effects but on the history development and characters left a lot to be desired
Mar 14 2019,positive,this was a great adaptation and i loved it
Mar 14 2019,negative,the movie was dull and boring the soundtrack was out of place too much exposition and this movie just didnt need to be made
Mar 14 2019,positive,solid addition to the mcu
Mar 14 2019,neutral,definitely a disappointment if you compare it thor ragnarok civil war or avenger 3 the intro and last few minutes were amazing  but the long middle portion felt bland and the side characters didnt have enough screen play to actually care about them nick fury cgi is breathtaking captain marvel didnt have her match in the movie the villains were too under powered and hence we dont know yet if she had any weakness maybe in end game we will see if thanos is of any match to her overall the movie isnt a break through as i thought it would be
Mar 14 2019,positive,very good and it also explains how something happened cant wait for endgame now
Mar 14 2019,negative,wrong actress wrong way to put this character in too close to endgame to throw in a character who can appear deus ex machina and never never ever attack your fans
Mar 14 2019,positive,was a ok movie not to the level i expected of a marvel movie
Mar 14 2019,negative,long boring w no charecter development or story arch cat was aight though
Mar 14 2019,positive,love this movie love bries larson
Mar 14 2019,negative,no character development the cinematography is okay but could have benefitted from less shaky cam
Mar 14 2019,negative,so watched captain marvel  there was something missing in the movie  brie larson could have done way better  and the references to the avengers and furys eye is just sad  also half way through the movie the plot just twisted into something ugly  loved the villain  i wanted this movie to succed cause i am actually a fan of the captain marvel character from other marvel media  fingers crossed for endgame
Mar 14 2019,positive,i thought it was perfectly paced and entertaining the whole time the time flew by but it never felt rushed and it kept me interested to the end 
Mar 14 2019,negative,fell flat not very interesting
Mar 14 2019,positive,highly enjoyable superhero action film with a tough female lead almost wish shed been tougher like ripley in aliens but its made for children as well as adults so she hit it just right looking forward to more
Mar 14 2019,negative,it felt very dragged on  i was hoping captain marvel would kick more butt but the whole thing felt boring
Mar 14 2019,positive,very fun love seeing a bad ass female super hero in the mcu
Mar 14 2019,negative,its just an ok movie theres nothing great on it
Mar 14 2019,positive,it was amazing young women need movies like this the insane amount of backlash only proves how important and wonderful this film was
Mar 14 2019,negative,some of the acting is just awful  not just from brie but from her supporting cast too  sam jackson was awesome as always but when a cgi cat is the best part of the movie its a sad movie
Mar 14 2019,positive,great movie carol danvers is one of the best mcus characters shes so funny
Mar 14 2019,negative,this is terribly boring
Mar 14 2019,negative,underwhelming introduction to a new marvel character it would have been better to introduce this character into an avenger film
Mar 14 2019,negative,i went to see this movie last night and it had good action parts at moments but as a marvel movie i expected more from it
Mar 14 2019,positive,we definitely liked it its a worthy addition to the mcu
Mar 14 2019,positive,saw this today with my two teenage boys and all three of us loved it  carol danvers is a great superhero period  the movie has a sense of heart humor and action  plus goose  loved it
Mar 14 2019,positive,910 pretty friggin awesome apart from the fact that some things just didnâtmt make sense like when akira already knew how to use carols suits color thing but apart from that it was amazing def recommended
Mar 14 2019,positive,great movie that continues the line of quality cinema that marvel has started  i cant wait to see what they have in store next
Mar 14 2019,positive,great film loved it
Mar 14 2019,negative,waste of a mcu movie forget endgame now
Mar 14 2019,positive,it wasnt up to marvel standards they had a problem with setting a background story and left it to a flash back so changing the original back story of carol and captain marvell the fight scenes were good and exciting but another 15 minutes spent on creating a tad bit better than a flash back to support the origins of the character would have done wonders
Mar 14 2019,negative,weak villian bad ploti felt as though the big villian wasnt so bad after all i didnt know what she was fighting for halfway through the movie
Mar 14 2019,negative,overall pretty bland and toneless im given no actually reason to care about any of the characters and most of the characters presented did a poor job of convincing me they arent actors playing a part but actually people i really believe this is do to the screen play and source material captain marvel is just not a great character sadly this movie brings that front and center
Mar 14 2019,positive,and explained a lot of things that i wanted to and was eagerly waiting to find out how they happened bree larson was awesome working with samuel jackson
Mar 14 2019,positive,very enjoyable movie explains the easter egg at the end of infinity
Mar 14 2019,negative,this movie was a total turd ripped off the origin of the real captain marvel do not waste your time with this political agenda made movie marvel finally jumped the shark with this one 
Mar 14 2019,positive,fuk the haters great movie 
Mar 14 2019,negative,i have to say that marvel just slipped on this one mcu had successfully introduced the comic superhero in this new cinematic universe by adapting the personalities of these figures that had been comprehensively set up in the comic to a 2 to 3 hour film however they failed to do that for captain marvel this character has a history and spirit in the comics but the film just failed to show the greatness of the character the film is largely storydriven or even universedriven too much focus on the power of captain marvel rather than the character ifself i understand the film want to represent a new era of female power or great things like that but it forgets what is the center of a movie the heroin or hero captain marvel and even nick fury loses their soul as if they were just puppet that blow energy waves and tell jokes i am a great fan of mcu and i see how marvel had successfully setup and give life to characters like iron man cap and others in this cinema universe and i hope they could give more soul and stronger focus on the character in the future captain marvel movies
Mar 14 2019,positive,even if you arent a marvel fav you will enjoy this movie loved the movie
Mar 14 2019,positive,great entertaining s lot of 90s nostalgia but left me with a lot of plot questions in the mcu
Mar 14 2019,negative,worst marvel movie i have seen yet but still worth watching so that you dont miss anything important for later marvel movies
Mar 14 2019,positive,honestly  its not a perfect movie not by a long shot but as a origin story it does exactly what it needs to do it introduces the hero and her early sturggles as a hero it has a nice conflict and the characters are interesting is it the best marvel movie no but is it bad not at all
Mar 14 2019,neutral,i enjoyed it but i enjoy almost all marvel movies have a little something was missing from this one i like the story with the skrulls but overall found that captain marvel herself was outshone by the secondary cast particularly ben mendelsson sam jackson and lashana lynch i found myself paying more attention to those three when they were present and the portions of the movie where they werent were the weakest overall not bad but no where near my favorite marvel movie
Mar 14 2019,positive,its an alright marvel film some cool action and brie larson is a joy nothing too original but can have some fun
Mar 14 2019,positive,here is a unbiased nosjw honest review it was ok theres definitely worse movies in the mcu but i could also think of 5 better off the top of my head i liked larsons portrayal of captain marvel but the rest of the acting was stale the movie was shot and produced well had a lackluster score overall the movie was just above average barely at best 
Mar 14 2019,positive,i liked this movie it was better than some early reviews lead me to expect  several good action scenes good pace soon developed a little humor and some attitude
Mar 14 2019,negative,it had nice graphics but it had so much continuity errors there is no motivation behind any of the fights nick fury used to be bad ass but not anymore besides the forced victim mentality in the movie it was ok not really thrilling
Mar 14 2019,positive,standard mcu fare which is great if you are a fan
Mar 14 2019,negative,it wasnt terrible it was terribly bland for a marvel movie it should really be a 610 or 35 but im giving it a 2 to let people know this film is not good
Mar 14 2019,negative,boring and not important
Mar 14 2019,neutral,the movie didnt make captain marvel the character interesting
Mar 14 2019,positive,formulaic but good  its great to see a strong noholdsbarred female lead with a diverse cast
Mar 14 2019,positive,fantastic film enjoyed every minute of it
Mar 14 2019,positive,the movie itself is ok downplayed because of the rest of the mcus quality expectation  spoiler alert  i hated how you chose to deal with nick furys eye
Mar 14 2019,positive,best origin movie i have ever seen brie larson definitely gets the character it got one of the best plot twists i have seen          goose      is            awesome
Mar 14 2019,positive,i saw it tonight and it was a lot of fun    maybe subtle spoilers  everything from the effects there werent any blatant cgi people the granny fight the entirity of nick fury scenes goose the powerful and he beat tie up at the end to justify why we havent see her prior to this    its a lot of fun and i recommend everyone give it a chance and dont listen to the manbabies who either assign it a mission rather than acknowledging it for what it isa woman kicking ass bitch about an out of context quote about the diversity of journalists or bizarre negative comparisons to wonder womanan entirely different premise it was a great movie and stands out from previous marvel ones as differentwhich is a good thing
Mar 14 2019,negative,pretty boring waste of money as usual 
Mar 14 2019,negative,bland movie at best bummed about all the hype green lantern was better than this 
Mar 14 2019,positive,captain marvel was a great movie with a plot twist that i didnt see coming i think its a great origin story many complained about the actress but i believe she did an amazing job cant wait to see her in avengers end game
Mar 14 2019,neutral,a strong performance from brie larson and humor from samuel l jackson cant save captain marvel from a ludicrous second half
Mar 14 2019,positive,i loved it i saw it more as a human power testament but it had a great plot good development and amazing cinematic design highly recommend seeing it
Mar 14 2019,positive,captain marvel was amazing
Mar 14 2019,negative,worst marvel movie yet even thor dark world was more entertaining the amazing cast and caracters were wasted with a boring story i had high hopes for this one but i was more disappointed than i was with black panther
Mar 14 2019,negative,wonder woman was way better and wonder woman was a 35
Mar 14 2019,negative,i thought it took away from the ending of captain america and threw a wrench in the mcu timelime it wasnt good and it wasnt bad i just left the theater confused on the importance of captain marvel and her role in the mcu
Mar 14 2019,positive,this movie was amazing loved it
Mar 14 2019,negative,this movie looked amazing however the story was very underwhelming and thought the movie was boring
Mar 14 2019,positive,fantastic movie  it is an amazing sheros journey  loved the 90s music
Mar 14 2019,negative,was maybe as good as antman and wasp without the laughs  save your money for end game hopefully ms marvel wont ruin it
Mar 14 2019,positive,i loved captain marvel as i loved brie larsson in it and it was great that they got into the agents of shield stuff and i love everything kree her powers were cool to but i hoped they would mention the inhumanscoulsonfury and goose were very funny
Mar 14 2019,positive,loved it not only does it set the stage for avengers endgame but it is everything a superhero film should be dont listen to any negative reviews and go and see for yourself oh and bring the kids
Mar 14 2019,negative,while politics from both sides made me consider not watching it i ended up watching it     despite it being marvels first female led superhero film it fails to make itself standout from the mcu this film is aggressively average whose main character is as bland as a cardboard box its a shame really as brie larson is a talented actress but she the directors and writers didnt know how they want to portray captain marvel do they want to make her a scrappy fighter who is so eager on getting into fights or do they want her to be a stoic leader who takes each situation at hand seriously i dont know what her personality is and this is a shame as previous mcu films do a decent job on creating likable main characters this is also problematic as she will be the face of the mcu in the future if she remains like this in future films you can count me out all i want is some form of believable personality    not only is the main character awful but the themes that the film tells are all lip service the film doesnt explore much of the themes and they only time when they do mention it is in forms of flashbacks or they are directly talking about them its a shame because the themes are very good and does have a positive message but the film doesnt do much and plays it extremely safe its all surface level and anyone who tries to get more out of it would look like fools    there are more complaints i have but i like to keep this one short and sweet at the films best its average but i find this film to be aggressively average to the point that its insulting the character is bland the film looks bland the themes are laughably nonexistent and just downright boring i cant recommend this film to anyone because of how forgettable it is and that endgame is coming out next month for this critic captain marvel is nothing to marvel about
Mar 14 2019,negative,saw it friday night  overall it was worth seeing  seeing a young nick fury was pretty cool the cat was funny  action scenes were decent  maybe i was expecting more but it was worth seeing  what i didnt like were the plot holes that a lead writer and someone making sure the captain marvel piece of the mcu fit correctly rather than shoved in and twisted  it could have been a really great movie but it felt rushed and sorta formulaic i hope to see more of brie larson as capt marvel and see her character developed much better  definitely see this movie if youre a mcu fan but just ignore the plot holes
Mar 14 2019,positive,all in all i felt that captain marvel was fine it had amazing deaging effects with sam jackson another great performance from jackson good buddy cop feel between fury and danvers one of my favorite stories no scripts in this franchise good use of the skrullssubverted my expectations  goose the cat is a highlight and a good performance from larson however the film botched the character with uneven character work tonal inconsistency with her and the entire script consistently questionable cgi a lackluster performance from jude law and too much 90s nostalgia to the point where it didnt help the immersion but rather took it away from me a good movie overall but would not own it once it came out on bluray    
Mar 14 2019,positive,great marvel movie nice to see a woman as protagonist for a change
Mar 14 2019,positive,i think we have become so accustomed to great marvel movies that when theres a really good one we arent satisfied i really enjoyed this move 
Mar 14 2019,positive,differently than other actions movies captain marvel is not only entertaining but also relevant to our current times i am incredibly happy for its success in the box office this is the type of movie we need this is the type of movies i want the future generations to look back and call a classic
Mar 14 2019,negative,the foreshadowing was really bad it gave away everything that was going to happen and there was only one twist in the entire film  to top it all off how powerful is she one moment the enemy can just get back up relatively unscathed and the next shes able to destroy a battleship with ease
Mar 14 2019,positive,enjoyed it immensely great fun movie definitely in the top 10 mcu
Mar 14 2019,positive,really shows marvelâtms good side
Mar 14 2019,neutral,okishnot a convincing herodevelopment story overconfident main hero linear storyline
Mar 14 2019,positive,i absolutely loved this movie and thought it was wonderful fun action packed and had heart would totally watch it again 
Mar 14 2019,negative,this movie was terrible
Mar 14 2019,negative,i was so excited to see captain marvel i was looking forward to a strong female lead i wasnâtmt impressed with brie larson at all the movie was okay but not at all on par with the other marvel movies captain marvel was not likeable in any way and i just didnâtmt enjoy this movie as much as i had hoped not impressed with the directing or acting
Mar 14 2019,positive,an origin story rearranged into a scifi thriller with slick visuals and a strong back and forth between sam jackson and brie larson cements captain marvel as an effective addition to the mcu
Mar 14 2019,positive,wildly entertaining and humorous with the right balance of action and mystery for a back story looking forward to the sequels that will dive deeper into her character will see again in theaters
Mar 14 2019,negative,boring predictable and with a flat story
Mar 14 2019,positive,love the cosmic focused world building stuff the carol  maria rambeaux stuff was probably the best stuff of the movie great back  forth between the 2 actresses the story  script however fell a little flat which tends to be the case lately with the marvel solo films black panther being the exception just seemed like they were holding back for the sequel which is a shame loved all the skrull stuff marvel needs to lean into the cosmic stuff with captain marvel 2 its the best parts of this movie really dive into the kreeskrull war for the sequel overall a solid marvel movie just not exceptional cant wait for aeg
Mar 14 2019,positive,another nice movie from marvel
Mar 14 2019,positive,loved this movie  carol danvers is so fun and inspiring to watch she is not perfect thank goodness she can be an irreverent goof and she falls down  a lot but she has a will of steel heart of gold and the drive to dust herself off and get back up every time  before she is ï 12unleashedï 12 as captain marvel she reminds me of a preserum captain america having all the right stuff in her heart including a willingness to sacrifice herself but being limited by physical strength  witnessing captain marvel take control of her abilities is supremely satisfying to watch i canï 12tmt wait for her return on april 26  not that iï 12tmm counting down the days or anythingï 1242 as of today
Mar 14 2019,negative,boring horrible story line
Mar 14 2019,positive,it closes lots of loopholes for the current story line and open up more opportunities or various others excellent my 12 year old child was excited to have lots of his questions answered and to see what the marvel universe future or possible future might hold 
Mar 14 2019,positive,it was a fun and energetic movie its no infinity war but it has a lot to offer to the mcu
Mar 14 2019,negative, the first 30 minutes of this movie are so bad that i wanted to walk out    it has the worst cinematography and special effects of any recent marvel movie   their isnt a single thrilling moment or scene that id want to revisit   their were 2 laughs in my theatre throughout the entire movie   samuel l jackson is the only person having any fun on scene    a complete and utter misfire
Mar 14 2019,positive,great film a difference pace than other marvel films is welcomed really enjoyed brie larson mf jackson and the cat
Mar 14 2019,negative,while it can sometimes have a few entertaining scenes captain marvel falls short in most categories the very few fight scenes in the movie are all extremely short and one sided at no point does captain marvel come across any sort of challenge in every other superhero movie the main hero is beaten down or must overcome some sort of difficult situations there was never a time where she was truly in danger      the movie as a whole felt very forced and out of place i enjoyed watching nick fury and goose much more than the main character she felt very flat emotionless and never really made the audience care about her        overall captain marvel isnâtmt the worst mcu movie but it is definitely close to the bottom
Mar 14 2019,positive,brie larsonâtms captain marvel is charming and relatable it stays true to the heart of the comics while also throwing in some inevitable twists only 4 stars because underneath it all itâtms still an origin story but as origin stories go this one did a great job of bringing the viewer on a journey along side the main characterâtms voyage of selfdiscovery
Mar 14 2019,negative,film was boring vintage nick fury and coulson carried the film until the action started and talos got involved
Mar 14 2019,negative,boring the implicit and explicit feminism in the movie makes the storytelling week
Mar 14 2019,positive,not the best marvel movie but far from the worst
Mar 14 2019,negative,it seemed old and boring bri larsen was uninspiring to say the least dont waste your money
Mar 14 2019,positive,this was one of my favorite marvel films i felt like it could have even been longer there was more to do but i absolutely loved it more than most other marvel origin movies cant wait to see captain marvel in endgame
Mar 14 2019,positive,one of the best movie of superhero i have seen
Mar 14 2019,positive,kind of starts off flat but picks up in energy and humour when jackson comes in  soundtrack is probably my favorite so far brie larsons portrayal of carol danvers is spot on if a little shy 10 for 10 positive messages for young girls everywhere
Mar 14 2019,negative,it was alright parts of it really dragged and the last fight the ã 14berpowerful captain marvel kinda bored me    seemed overly reliant on 90s nostalgia to me too
Mar 14 2019,positive,a great portrayal of a strong female lead character i enjoyed going back in time in the mcu
Mar 14 2019,positive,this movie was great its another solid addition to the marvel cinematic universe while it did have some issues with pacing here and there and also what seemed somewhat stiff acting from brie larson i attributed it to the character being kree it had everything you expect from marvel action comedy and enough to tug at the heart strings to maybe make you shed a tear or two with a touching tribute to stan lee its one i would definitely recommend
Mar 14 2019,positive,brilliant movie best superhero flick ive seen in a while
Mar 14 2019,positive,wonderfully fun and inspiring movie with great actors and a lot of laughs for those of us who remember the 90ies  
Mar 14 2019,positive,great film the figt scenes were sick especially at the end and the train scene loved the friendship between fury and carol loved the film watched it multiple times 
Mar 14 2019,positive,i write this review if only to beat back the hateful idiots deliberately trying to sabotage this movies    while not a perfect movie brie larson does a good job injecting a human element into a very chaotic scifi world  the movie feels like it is holding back in some ways but it lays a decent groundwork from where the hero can grow from  jackson is also serviceable as the up and coming nick fury
Mar 14 2019,negative,the film seems to be a formality just to add captain marvel into the avengers scenario nothing new or epic
Mar 14 2019,positive,overall the good film with some humor and lightheartedness along with some serious moments the visuals were very well done and the acting was pretty good
Mar 14 2019,negative,this movie sucks go watch alita its way better
Mar 14 2019,positive,i had heard mixed reviews and wondered whether the movie would do well financially because of the rare female lead in a comic movie however the movie stands up well it had enough plot enough silly jokes great cameos marvel injokes fantastic effects and it was fun whilst it makes me even more excited for endgame it was a great movie on its own
Mar 14 2019,negative,the cat was great ben mendelsohn was great  carol danvers was meh movie was slow and the ending was meh captain marvel had the least amount of person growth from any other marvel hero overall if you skip this movie you will not miss much   it was fine
Mar 14 2019,positive,amazing movie have some problems with the special effects but the plot is really good and fix with the entire saga
Mar 14 2019,positive,best marvel movie of them all and one of my favorite films of all times a real feelgood movie funny good casting and uplifting message
Mar 14 2019,positive,it was a good movie and up voting it to show those haters a thing or two
Mar 14 2019,positive,fantastic thank you marvel thank you brie larson why did it take 10 years for a female led marvel film i dont know was it worth the wait yes should we ever have to wait that long again no 
Mar 14 2019,negative,predicable bad movie everything feeled artificial no recommend
Mar 14 2019,positive,a really nice addition to the mcu some excellent comedy scenes with larson and jackson nice effects and really enjoyable action came out of the cinema happy and excited to see more of carol in avengers endgame
Mar 14 2019,negative,this movie was mediocre at best brie larson literally has no emotion in this movie its like watching paint dry some of the fight scenes were cool but overall this movie was meh best part of it was the intro credit where they honored stan lee 
Mar 14 2019,positive,it is just another marvel movie but fun
Mar 14 2019,positive,loved it the 90s music and background took me back to my teen years brie larson was compelling and a good choice for this character  the special affects were amazing and i experienced asmr so many times i was getting bored with marvel movies but captain marvel had reinvigorated my love for them
Mar 14 2019,negative,the movie was good but it feels like at thins point with marvel studios that the quality of the action and story telling is starting to fade because of a lack of keeping the continuity straight but the story flow for me really didnâtmt work like iron man or any of the other origin films because it felt too much like it captain marvel was just a set up for avengers endgame
Mar 14 2019,positive,not nearly as good as the previews indicated it would be the main character was not as exciting or dynamic as i wouldâtmve hoped a super hero would be
Mar 14 2019,negative,i was so looking forward to this but the film was disappointing poor story arc wooden acting and plot holes everywhere its sad that there was so much hype because the character deserved a much better story it has nothing to do that the central character is a woman i loved the wonder woman movie and it has nothing to do with empowerment of people of colour i adore the black panther movie its just that captain marvel has no pathos no humanity brie larson may be an acclaimed actor but in this she is wooden and lacking anything akin to any emotion spoilers the story itself doesnt explain why or how these powers work any vulnerabilities or why she is fighting along side the kree the skrulls are a nice twist but ronans character is a cardboard cut out every chance the film gets to vilify men and for larsons character to beat up men is used jude laws character is every male chauvinistic arch stereotype amalgamation there is no struggle in larsons character to reconnect with her humanity sure there are some flashbacks and some nice memory reviews with her old flying buddy and her buddys daughter but there is no true reconnect with that humanity not even a struggle its just so hard to connect with the character captain marvel has no rage or anger at the kree even after she discovers her life has been a lie and they imprisoned her power and used her as a weapon in the final battle screen she shows little emotion in her want to protect earth sure she does it decisively but there is no passion it is just phoned in i think that there were three things that severely disengaged the audience the first being how the story was written second perhaps is the directing ques that captain marvel is mind altered and brainwashed by the kree so she is just a soldier puppet but this could have been a great strong story arc tool to demonstrate her battle between her resurfacing humanity and struggling to keep control kree side but larson played it safe and was so stiff and devoid of anything resembling emotion she might as well been a vulcankree it was contrived politically overbearing and the limited character development meant that the audience had a very hard time investing in and connecting with the main protagonist character the cat was good 
Mar 14 2019,positive,these is enought to understand character information also visual effects and other pictures is really quality for take attention from audience
Mar 14 2019,positive,this movie feels like the original thor but with the experience of years of marvel movies behind it
Mar 14 2019,negative,way to political and brie larson was not inspiring  also disagree with mcu eliminating the existence of ms marvel and skrulls as the poor immigrants that captain marvel needs to protect
Mar 14 2019,negative,boring and predictible a waste of time only reason to watch it is to be ready for endgame
Mar 14 2019,negative,film was overall fun however when i come to see a film thats the first time we get a characters solo outing especially a marvel film i want to get invested and see the character grow characters growing matters a lot to me and captain marvel made the movie bland with poor to no character development she went from strong to stronger no vulnerabilities no nothing nothing to connect and say i was like her at one point  we just get thrown into a film with a character no one can relate to in their growth as a characterperson because there was none    heres to hoping the russo brothers can get us invested with her character in endgame was very disappointed with this film
Mar 14 2019,negative,the movie was rather boring the special effects were uninspired no character development plot was lame except for moments with nick fury pretty much the movie was made slightly bareable by samuel l jackson no character arc or time spent on hero learns power that is traditional for origin superhero movies its just goes from zero to hero instantly with no real challenge tension scary villain etc
Mar 14 2019,positive,so much different from other mcu origin movies brie larson is a great choice for captain marvel an incredible movie with amazing characters
Mar 14 2019,negative,mediocre movie at best how about marvel get back to stylish like thor funny like gotg character driven like iron man movies with cool villains like infinity war with no political or social commentary and cringe jokes
Mar 14 2019,neutral,it was just ok i found the whole thing forced i would say it the best of the worst of mcu films but worst of the best mcu films right in the middle if you dont see this film you not going to miss anything even the end credit scene meh
Mar 14 2019,positive,though the script was a bit weak at some points captain marvel ties up all the loose ends that we were all wanting to know in a satisfying way
Mar 14 2019,negative,second least favorite of the marvel movies wonder woman is much better
Mar 14 2019,negative,the most lackluster marvel film yet completely disengaged from the characters and the overpowered ending sealed the opinion 
Mar 14 2019,positive,better than i expected and i expected a lot  lots of humor surprises  and action
Mar 14 2019,neutral,nonspoiler  very bland acting with mediocre story elements with only hints of action and emotion the story wouldve had more emotional impact on the viewer if we had been given more reason to connect with carol danvers her power is unique but theres no value to how strong she really is
Mar 14 2019,positive,i saw this once already and will see again  i took my daughter who is a big fan of spider man especially into the spiderverse and she loved this
Mar 14 2019,positive,strong characterintro movie with enjoyable plot and a good character whether she was female or male i enjoyed the interrelationships even though part of the plot was a little too obvious a little too early on they did a good job of making the audiences emotional connection to the characters easy and natural and although danvers was a bit abrasive at the beginning she seemed to get more comfortable with her role as the movie went on altogether a nice addition to the mcu
Mar 14 2019,positive,one of the best if not the best marvel movies ever
Mar 14 2019,positive,good movie worth seeing and you can bring the kids if you want may not be spectacular like the black panther but definitely worth watching a few times     plus you know bringing up the movies score and spiting all those little boy trolls who drove it down
Mar 14 2019,negative,between the lack of action terrible acting by brie and boring storyline this is one that marvel needs to retract the one part of the movie that could have been good when the action finally began was wasted as brie flew through the air seemingly having a great time as she screamed whoooo as she crashed through planes that have escaped from the video game classic space invaders only reason people are seeing this movie is to prepare for end game
Mar 14 2019,negative,weakest film in whole marvel universe after ragnarok
Mar 14 2019,positive,loved it no real complaints
Mar 14 2019,positive,dont believe the haters this movie is fun a bit more restrained than most marvel movies but i found that refreshing brie larson was perfectly cast even though the trailers had me doubting she nailed it
Mar 14 2019,negative,worst film ive ever seen from marvel the movie breaks established lore in the mcu avoid this movie
Mar 14 2019,negative,standard superhero movievillain was bland the fight scenes where more like an adult beating up a 5th grader instead of a struggle between right and wronggood or evil
Mar 14 2019,negative,jokes seemed to forced all the flashback of her being harassed in the end didnt mean anything
Mar 14 2019,positive,mothers take your daughters to see this movie  semispoiler alert  carol danvers got back up every time she was knocked down i loved the way that the character was decpicted growing up human with such determination and courage something the the kree did not understand about her  this very human female is a role model for young girls even before she had super powers she was unstoppable  she had a rough childhood but she found other strong females  bond with and she created her own  family  what a great message  please more strong females like this one
Mar 14 2019,positive,amazing really breaks the mold in so many ways
Mar 14 2019,negative,corny portrayal of captain marvel   samuel l jackson is the only reason this film wasnâtmt a disaster
Mar 14 2019,positive,this movie was actually better than i thought it would be im really not a fan of superman and those kind of unstoppable heros it doesnt make it that exciting when they re unstoppablebut they really made the charachter believable in this one
Mar 14 2019,negative,a sad attempt to introduce a character
Mar 14 2019,positive,great movie brie is fantastic dont pay attention to the trolls who want destroy the rating be objective
Mar 14 2019,negative,it was marginally entertaining only if you dont care about the mcu as a whole she is uninteresting and cant seem to keep her same characterization throughout this is basically top gun meets star wars dressed up as a superhero amnesiac movie not good dont waste your money
Mar 14 2019,positive,it was a solid entry not much of an origin story though saw it twice by myself and gave it 3 stars the third time i took my wife and she gave it  5 stars they must be doing something right it could have used more details about her past but i really enjoyed the experience next stop end game
Mar 14 2019,positive,not my favorite marvel movie but not my least favorite by a landslide great to see some callbacks and enjoy some lighthearted marvel humor
Mar 14 2019,positive,captain marvel is a brilliant film even if the first five minutes are slower than what is to be expected from a marvel film brie larson and samuel l jackson were spot on and i thought they worked well together would definitely recommend
Mar 14 2019,positive,great movie a hero that everyone male and female can be inspired by also a very important film in the avengers series
Mar 14 2019,negative,movie was meh one of the lowest on my marvel list brie larsons acting was terrible
Mar 14 2019,positive,fantastic the soundtrack was my sixth grade didnâtmt noticed the deaging effects too much canâtmt wait to see more from carol
Mar 14 2019,negative,movie was far bellow average plotholes unlikable characters no tension due to undefeatable main character the marketing was outright toxic the only positive point i could find was that i enjoyed the style of the website
Mar 14 2019,negative,pretty boring movie nothing special shes invincible the whole movie there are no steaks on the line samuel jackson was good brie larson acting was terrible but maybe that was just because her character was poorly written
Mar 14 2019,positive,up there with black panther and thor ragnarok for the best mcu movies
Mar 14 2019,negative,i watched the screenerdidnt even care to finish watchingtypical hollywood cheese almost felt like i was watching a dc film
Mar 14 2019,positive,it was not a terrible movie the visual effects were spectacular but i was not interested in the story nor did i care about carol danvers the acting was not superb she was a bit boring for me and i did not know if i really cared for her but its not terrible
Mar 14 2019,negative,all politics aside is captain marvel the worst superhero movie  absolutely not  fan4stic had the entire cast and crew attempting to disavow their participation within the movie before it came out  the hulk well enough said  is it among the worst marvel movies in the mcu  without a doubt    captain marvel follows the character carol danvers a us airforce pilot from the late 80s who was given powers via an experimental alien engine explosion powered by the tesseract 6 years after losing her memories to the same event that gave her powers    the movie really struggles to find a tone or style at all  from a very mundane car chase to very bland fight scenes to extremely poor character motivations  the movie feels like youre looking at the mona lisa but the paint by numbers watercolor version  is it the mona lisa  yes but like a really cheap one  is this a marvel movie  yes but like a really cheap one
Mar 14 2019,positive,honestly my favourite marvel film yet made me want to cry with happiness at seeing a woman like me so powerful and embracing her emotions and mind alike i have nothing to prove to you is one of the most powerful moments in this franchise so far and i am so overjoyed
Mar 14 2019,negative,as much as the mcu needed a heroine movie this is not the one we deserved it lacked any luster and brilliance of previous films and completely drove fans mad with its marketing claiming her to be the first avenger i mean seriously did they all forget the title of captain america brie larsons mix of humor and seriousness was only tolerable due to the character of nick fury should have made a scarlett witch nebula or black widow movie 55
Mar 14 2019,negative,instead of using a strong script and quality actors captain marvel uses a sledgehammer to drive it home that girls are cool too i guess  meh
Mar 14 2019,negative,third time trying to write a review for this movie because when i check later i see my profile has made 0 reviews the movies was not terrible but not particularly good i dont see how its got a 79 fresh rating im not even certain the current 62 is particularly accurate the pacing of the movie wasnt very good there were definitely some nostalgic moments for me as i grew up in the 90s however the soundtrack probably shouldnt make it hard to hear the sound effects or dialog the chemistry between the characters of captain marvel and agent fury was pretty great although the way they made agents coulson and fury look younger was a bit disconcerting sort of uncanny valley the continuity issues from other mcu movies didnt really make sense either in iron man coulson introduces himself as part of the strategic homeland intervention enforcement and logistics division to which pepper potts when hes trying to get a foot in the door to talk with tony stark he later tries to talk to tony directly and a similar exchange comes up both times its mentioned the name is a mouthful by the end of the movie he says just call us shield if this all happens in 2008 why is the agent coulson of 1995 already calling the organization by its acronym why does danvers hear nirvanas come as you are in her mind when she disappeared in 1989 and wasnt on earth for the 1991 release of the smells like teen spirit album how is she capable of utilizing her newly gained abilities flawlessly without the benefit of practice to see what her abilities do the first time i tried riding a motorcycle i could barely keep it upright and couldnt avoid stalling the motor our hero can gain the ability to fly and zip around with ease without losing control and blast things that are moving at some pretty high speeds with remarkable accuracy all without having tried to do those things earlier in the film how is she also able to fly all the different craft she pilots made from different planets kree warship skrull escape pod us air force f15 experimental jetthere are more continuity errors but this is a pretty lengthy list already    all these issues would be moot if this was a standalone movie but to be given to the audience as an important origin story leading to the mcus overall plot of the infinity war this poses problems that shouldnt have made it to the final film ill refrain from diving into the controversial and political things people have mentioned about this movie and say as an mcu movie captain marvel fell a bit short again not horrible i was entertained but i have way too many complaints to justify calling this a good movie i hope the writing team puts more effort into continuity for future movies
Mar 14 2019,negative,good action not keen on the plot holes breaking continuity in the great mcu storyline the tessaract no real moral messagedevelopment to hold the character in high regard felt rushed
Mar 14 2019,positive,its what you expect from a marvel movie brie larson is fantastic offering a strong vulnerable and caring character that i simply want to see more of stunning visuals great soundtrack a real tribute to the 90s a great enjoyable film that is a great place for new starters to the franchise but rewarding those that have been with them from the beginning
Mar 14 2019,positive,it was okay had its moments  didnt hate it but didnt love it
Mar 14 2019,neutral,itâtms ok certainly some very entertaining moments but majoritively bland with a lacking character development sure a lot of things happen to her that are life changing but her personality remains the same throughout she mostly just ends up getting more power by having the confidence to try harder once sheâtms is unbeatably powerful she has a new found confidence thatâtms not real development because what fear is there to conquer once you punch a few spaceships out of existence and lazer cannon fire is bouncing off your chest no need to get into the controversial aspects of the film as they can be summed up as distracting whether regarding critics and propaganda beforehand or story devices and writing in the actual film distracting throughout if this had come out in phase one which is no disservice to some of those great films iâtmd be giving it a b with added concern about the direction of the mcu as a whole iâtmd be lacking excitement for the future as this film disregards many aspects of the various captain marvel storylines in marvel comics and fails to delve into more interesting cheaply teased references itâtms as if they know what the mcu empire was built upon but they are choosing to use it as cinematic âclickbaitâ i fail to see the purpose of getting comic fans excited to see the great stories that have been hinted only to let down their hopes and give them something unfamiliar the mcu was built on comic geek feeling that kevin feige and co had finally figured out how to tweek comics just enough to where they worked on the big screen but also did poetic justice to their original content those geeks like myself force friends and family alike to come see these films with themand it slowly took hold finally a medium that made comics digestible for the general audience and praise oden they lifelong comic fans finally would see their favorite stories on the big screen this film simply fails to be an universally satisfying as a stand alone film captain marvel is averagely entertaining not a waste of the ticket price and even holds its own if within mcu phase 1  minus the lacking ode to the comics but by todayâtms mcu standards i rate it at 255 stars that being said it was scarcely close to being a top heir marvel movie hard to say whether improving acting or writing would have the greatest benefit to the poor character development whatâtms more certain is that if aspects that make it controversial are replaced with original content weâtmd have a much better film the captain marvel from the comics is already written as an amazing influential and imposing female character whom no other character would even begin to doubt or take lightly the film unfortunately fails in this respect as it feels the need to directly tell us how we are supposed to see her rather than simply showing us through how she responds to plot devices itâtms good enough to where iâtmll watch it again as i do all marvel films but iâtmll be playing on my phone and only look up when she is kicking some butt final score  255
Mar 14 2019,positive,a decent movie brie larson was the worst part of the film with subpar acting but everything else was okay
Mar 14 2019,negative,i think that they tried to politicize this movie too much they made the movies values too much about her being a woman and really playing up the girl power rather than promoting these values subtly it almost felt like they had only one shot at a female lead movie and they wanted to make it count
Mar 14 2019,negative,everyone but larson shines unfortunately team goose anyone
Mar 14 2019,positive,best origin story yet loved the writing bree did a great job bringing captain marvel into the mcu my kids both walked out with a new favorite marvel hero cant wait to see her team up with the avengers in endgame like thor said i like this one
Mar 14 2019,negative,it was an ok movie except that brie larson just sucks the fun and excitement out of each scene  if you like watching awkward scenes watch this movie also this movie is not important to see before endgame spoilers captain marvel will just appear in endgame
Mar 14 2019,negative,underscores the mcu and existing story lines
Mar 14 2019,positive,captain marvel introduces a superheroine i can stand behind shes funny without being obnoxious strong without the absurd and feminine without being over the top 455
Mar 14 2019,positive,brie larsons captain marvel brings a whole new angle to the mcu shes immensely powerful and knows it like thor but thor has been beat down and knows his vulnerability cm its seems has yet to truly face that i think  i thoroughly enjoyed the 90s action movie feel like so many movies today i often come out feeling like there was a lot of nuance i missed and it seemed hurried in spots but overall i enjoyed the movie and look forward to seeing her in endgame
Mar 14 2019,negative,very disappointing dry movie it got one laugh 1 cheerfor stans cameo and one clap at the end no one else joined in and the cinema was fullâ  maybe its because it following a string of marvel hits but this movie felt unnatural and forcedâ  the jokes were bad and at times just insulting the character has no arch she is who she is and just goes full super saiyan 4 out of no whereâ  looks like with the addition of mrs marvel end game should be wraped up in 5 minutes
Mar 14 2019,negative,bored and tightened
Mar 14 2019,negative,the good the little bit of action that we got during the movie was good the beginning of the movie started off really well the rapport between jude law and brie larson was very good    the meh the finally fight scene was terrible nick furys character was completely assassinated he no longer seems like the badass he was shield was awful they were made to seem to be just office people the entire middle of the movie was boring the entire farm scene in louisiana was boring it had zero direction it was alot like the scene in aou but drawn out even more    the bad captain marvel wasnt threatened at all the entire movie she never had any controversy or struggle even when she lost her sparring match she won by blasting him away the final fight completely made guardians of the galaxy 1 seem like a total waste of time ronin the accuser was made out to be an amazing warrior but captain marvel made him seem to be a no one
Mar 14 2019,negative,dull and boringalmost fell asleepdoesnt lice up to the hype of other marvel movies
Mar 14 2019,positive,i loved the portrayal of captain marvel her selfdiscovery and downtoearth nature were wonderful to watch the action scenes were great loved it
Mar 14 2019,positive,i dont enjoy being preached to when watching a superhero movie i dont think captain marvela story was written well enough and feels shoehorned into the mcu
Mar 14 2019,positive,a movie about a strong woman who is fighting fãr her life her friends and against a lot of men who think that they are worthier than her seeing brie larson warlking down the halls head up having fun whilst kicking her enemies  has been a great joy
Mar 14 2019,negative,aggressively mediocre for a late stage marvel film
Mar 14 2019,positive,one of the best movies in the series a lot of fun from start to finish
Mar 14 2019,positive,yet another terrific film in the amazing marvel cinematic universe stan lees cameo brought both a smile to my face and a year to my eye as a fan of both the man and what he was doing in the film brie larson is fantastic as carol danvers slj is again perfect as nicholas j fury and ben mendelsohn is wonderful as skrull commander talos screw all the negative troll reviews and go and watch this film you wont be disappointed i look forward to seeing more of the new captain in endgame
Mar 14 2019,positive,great movie for the mcu
Mar 14 2019,negative,one of the weaker mcu films it tries to have heart but fails  there are some funny moments like all mcu movies  but i feel like they are trying to shove this in our face and make us like it  theres not much to like shes just this nearly invincible character with not much character arc
Mar 14 2019,neutral,i like the movie but the combination of the actress acting and other things it was a let down for me
Mar 14 2019,neutral,the most average movie you will see this attempt to make a movie by directors anna boden and ryan fleck is the epitome of just trying to get a c a very boring movie with very little substance in fact this movie was not something i was looking forward to seeing but only saw it because it was the last movie before avengers endgame to call this movie reasonably good is an insult to all of cinema i expected nothing from this movie and got just that i would rather watch the room than this because i know the room is comically bad and i know what i am getting out of it but this movie had a large budget and little to offer i am utterly displeased with this movie but the inclusion of a female superhero is a radical idea half the reason this movie gets such a high rating from me is because of the inclusion of the fairer sex in conclusion marvel can do so much better than this
Mar 14 2019,negative,a dull movie that sullies the character of fury in order to make itâtms lead more likeable totally skippable addition to the franchise
Mar 14 2019,positive,i enjoyed many of the marvel movies better than cpt marvel  plot is elementary at best and action is average to sup par
Mar 14 2019,positive,captain marvel was a fun entertaining movie that is unfortunately bogged down by a boring lead character not brie larsons fault and a couple plot points that are not the strongest
Mar 14 2019,positive,an absolutely fantastic film and a worthy addition to the mcu great characterisation and an excellent origin story its about time the mcu presented a hero protagonist who is a a strong female lead  fabulous use of diverse casting loved it cant wait to take my niece to see this
Mar 14 2019,positive,honestly i was scared to see this film but left cheering this movie is fun and very well executed carol was wonderfully written and im beyond excited to see what comes next for her wonderful cast visuals and story
Mar 14 2019,positive,very fun movie had a blast watching
Mar 14 2019,negative,kinda boring samuel jackson was good but thats a no brainer
Mar 14 2019,negative,worst marvel movie in a long time
Mar 14 2019,positive,really good with a non angry young samuel jackson lobed the 90s tech references and all the 90s references i thought the soundtrack could have been better though for 90s
Mar 14 2019,negative,reluctantly caved to see this after her comments  i have enjoyed all mcu movies up until this  i did not feel anything one way or another about the character i could have cared less what happened to her  i thought nick furyâtms role is now downplayed  i am glad i waited for 5 tuesday and not full price i have no desire to see her in any other movies
Mar 14 2019,negative,saw it last night wasnt as bad as people are saying but certainly not as good as people are saying brie wasnt that bad in role and jude law and sam jackson are great honestly though the movie serves no purpose to the current narrative leading into endgame and has a handful of really bad retcons not worth seeing in the theater in my opinion but check it out when it hits blu ray
Mar 14 2019,positive,it was an enjoyable movie not as good as some other marvel movies but it was entertaining 
Mar 14 2019,positive,i want to be captain marvel i want the suit the mohawk and to shoot people with my flame hands im 33 years old surely thats what superhero movies are all about
Mar 14 2019,positive,despite the negative reviews around the emotional range of brie overall the movie made sense of it through the plot you get what you expect from a marvel movie as far as quality plus the benefit of a female lead to keep it fresh
Mar 14 2019,positive,for those expecting the next comic book movie to become the next cultural representation or the next feminist movement avant garde dont bother yourself to watch this movie but if you want to have some fun and continue your experience through the marvel cinematic universe do come and watch this movie especially now you know that captain marvel would play a part in endgame i think the opening scene is a bit slow and the trailers that was shown is a bit misleading however overall this movie is ok for an origin story spoiler alert  the retconned story also did not much alter the mcu timeline and also possibly eliminate or at least diminish the fans theory regarding certain shapeshifting species plays a part in the previous installment of mcu movies from iron man to now because the narrative of the story is that they are basically an intergalactic refugee just trying to find a place far and peaceful enough to hide from their genocidal enemy  the best moment for me involve a certain flerken species in action hoepfully we will see more of you in the next mcu installment goose
Mar 14 2019,negative,very boring with horrible acting
Mar 14 2019,positive,solid action movie with some powerful scenes
Mar 14 2019,neutral,it had potential but failed to live up to said potential several scenes seemed a cut and paste from other works like top gun and independence day the jokes and soundtrack wanted to be guardians of the galaxy but again came up short the past mcu endeavors have set the bar high and this just didnt live up to the rest if the catalog very much a meh
Mar 14 2019,positive,great movie saw it opening night with my boyfriend at our odeon cinema some parts were a little cliche âpick yourself upâ type of scene but it was enjoyable the first post credit scene was awesome too
Mar 14 2019,positive,i loved this movie brie larson did such a great job im so excited to see captain marvel in endgame
Mar 14 2019,neutral,its an ok movie on par with iron man 2 or thor dark world it is not a classic nor is it as good as wonder woman
Mar 14 2019,neutral,i would have to say that i found the general motions of the movie to be alright the cinematography for the most part worked and the majority of the supporting cast were wonderful samuel l jackson akira akbar ben mendolson i did enjoy some of the fight scenes and i found larson and jacksons interactions during the first half of the movie to be rather funny i liked the effects a lot especially those of the incident that gave carol danvers her powers and those used to show skrull transformation    however there was a lot done wrong with this movie in my opinion for one i found the plot to be generally lacking and shoehorned in several places yes i am more than well aware that the mcu is separate from the comics and that many things are different but the liberties they took with the kreeskrull war and marvell frustrated me greatly while i would have greatly enjoyed the plot twist with talos and his crew in another circumstance how the conflict was changed in order to shoehorn in a political message left a rather sour taste in my mouth yes political messages can be done well in comics and they have quite often in the past but changing the source material here just felt cheap and inane the kreeskrull war in the comic was one that was fought more or less equally between two criminal empires seeking to expand and conquer earth with both sides having people capable of good and evil in them however the movie instead changes this morally unclear situation into a very forced blackandwhite narrative between the skrulls and the kree i do think the plot would be a lot less egregious if talos and his crew were still caught in the crossfires of a war between two vast powers with talos being the rogue agent fury claimed of danvers in the first act aside from that plot point i think the movie would have also done better if there had been more focus on marvell she seemed like such an interesting and fascinating character to be caught in this conflict yet the movie doesnt give much of an indepth view as to who she was as a person i think there should have been more of the movie dedicated to exploring danvers relationship to the heroine marvell which would have made discovering her death all the more poignant  as for other issues and nitpicks i did generally dislike much of the action scenes in the later half of the movie the fighting on the dark ship was hard to follow and the constant cuts between actions made it disorienting there was not much narrative payoff to the majority of these scenes with a certain lack of weight being apparent in most another nitpick is the movies need to subvert narrative and tropic expectations alongside there being a lack of narrative payoff for many things the beginning act of the movie set up possible plot threads to wrap around and use effectively but it seems that so many of them were wasted the beginning fight between yonrogg and carol seemed to set up a very satisfying further encounter between a former mentor and the metaphorical student however the movie just wasted this instead having the main antagonist blasted off screen with little actual struggle from the protagonist this was entirely anticlimactic in what should have been an incredibly poignant scene of carol danvers rise to prominence and success in her struggles against that which pushed her down earlier instead any narrative weight was taken from it and carol won the fight without a single shred of struggle or difficulty it did subvert my expectations yes but it was narratively unsatisfying and only hampered the film   i think the movie is a decent one but its many flaws keep it from truly shining i do think carol danvers can be a truly interesting character but this movie put the wrong foot forward for her
Mar 14 2019,negative,bland movie boring character
Mar 14 2019,positive,great movie   thy did have to cramp up her origin into one movie to get ready for end game it was kind of messy but they got it done  people that donâtmt know how her character is in the comics say they she acted emotionless in this film but thatâtms her character in the comics too deal with it the movie was great
Mar 14 2019,negative,could have been a lot better really a let down for the mcu universe
Mar 14 2019,negative,i really didnt enjoy this at all they made her seem invincible with no weakness at all and really made it boring and not very suspenseful the movie also fails to address the obvious questions for the overarching story all in all the story was subpar for the quality marvel has produced so far with more focus on current culture shifts rather then be an entertainment piece
Mar 14 2019,negative,a quite bad and repetetive movie
Mar 14 2019,positive,sure it wasnt the best mcu movie theyve released but its still ten times better than anything dc brings out
Mar 14 2019,positive,so the thing is i wasnt really interested about this movie but it surprised me how enjoyable it was it had great humor inside jokes cultural references and ideas it looked great so i had a great time watching it it would have been a big mistake to miss it out 
Mar 14 2019,negative,meh one of the worst marvel movies to date may even be worst than thor 2 this movie does nothing to expand the marvel universe but rather it rewrites the universe terrible
Mar 14 2019,negative,just a let down across the board mcu fans deserve better
Mar 14 2019,positive,loved it funny sweet and breezed through exposition instead of dwelling on backstory
Mar 14 2019,positive,absolutely amazing larson did a wonderful job portraying a classic character and i look forward to seeing her role in future marvel movies
Mar 14 2019,positive,fun entertaining movie another great marvel movie
Mar 14 2019,negative,maybe its the high expectation but i have to say the action is merly average the story is not that intresting even all the references to fury and colson seems forced and our hero is preety indifferent to whatever going on at the moment for a girl with no memory that discover something new every moment i expect to be a litlle suprised how else could i relate to her
Mar 14 2019,negative,probably the second worst movie from marvel
Mar 14 2019,negative,boring as fuuuuck black panther all over again
Mar 14 2019,neutral,it was just boring and never really took flight for me
Mar 14 2019,negative,well i saw the movie captain marvel it was not really that great i liked some of the movie the action was good in places humor was sometimes funny but mostly just put in i didnt not enjoy this movie over all i give it one starl
Mar 14 2019,negative,not my cup of tea as a die hard fanboy this one is not one of them
Mar 14 2019,positive,nowhere near as bad as people are trying to make it seem
Mar 14 2019,negative,i wanted to like it but it was just ok i will not be revisiting it
Mar 14 2019,positive,i really enjoyed the action and the humour  and the wonderful relationships that were explored throughout the maria and carol one is really beautiful to watch these are clearly two woman who mean a lot to each other and love each other
Mar 14 2019,positive,while it could stand to have a little more action and smoother editing captain marvel is a welcome hero to the mcu with a good supporting cast a compelling story and an awesome headbutter in the form of carol captain marvel is a slight but still entertaining win for marvel
Mar 14 2019,positive,as with all movies i separate actors from the roles they play in this instance it extends to controversial statements brie larson has made that i fundamentally disagree with so my task was to judge this movie soley within its own confines    with that said i think the feminism elements were quite mild compared to how it was marketed obviously there are a few scenes where this is more blatant but not enough to deserve an eyeroll it never pulls me out of the experience     this movie suffers from pacing issues this is my biggest critique there are some sections the middle being the worst  where the dialogue drags on is quiet and slows progression  however  i think it has a solid beginning and and for the most part a satisfying entertaining ending however  to refer back to my pacing issue theres dialogue between carol and nick fury that is awkwardly quiet at points and a joke that didnt land before they discuss the upgraded pager    as for brie larsons acting here i didnt have many issues her stoic almost bland personality is technically explained by the fact that shes largely suffering from amnesia and is a trained super soldier her true personality peeps through with sarcastic wisecracks this comes out more and more as she discovers her identity i think carol danvers will be a unique personality among the avengers she has the sense of moral duty like captain america but also has the personality of stark and strange    action was ok special effects were above average the side characters served their role well    it was a unique origin story as it involved amnesia as the primary engine hopefully the pacing issues are solved in the next movie overall  i was satisfied and didnt feel like i was cheated out of cash for the ticket
Mar 14 2019,positive,movie was ok i wouldnt say the worst my problem was certain story elements and the actress playing carol was deadpan no emotion
Mar 14 2019,negative,these superhero movies are to the american cinema are what soft drinks are to the american diet 
Mar 14 2019,negative,there were too many plotholes overhyped and its kind of meh
Mar 14 2019,positive,it was a decent installment in the marvel universe it felt kinda strange in the first half but picked up really well to the point making it of it being worth 4 stars   of course goose and nick fury stole the entire half till captain marvel got all her powers
Mar 14 2019,negative,very disappointed worst marvel movie
Mar 14 2019,negative,poor acting forced writing and a wellmeaning but awkwardly executed soundtrack but none of this matters since it seems like negative commentary is getting censored here
Mar 14 2019,negative,everything is so perfunctory and lifeless in this movie that i almost fell asleep several times while watching it and i cant see any good reason why this story had to be told except for the obvious fact that it wants to introduce a character who is supposed to be important later
Mar 14 2019,negative,great actors bad plot
Mar 14 2019,positive,not top tier nor bottom tier mcu this film does just the right amount of comedy and action with an okay plot but much improved origin story
Mar 14 2019,negative,pretty boring could see brie larson as a hero
Mar 14 2019,neutral,captain marvel is a basically good movie with a good story competent script and it looks good however brie larsen was bland and lifeless her relationship with her best friend was unconvincing the movie benefited from strong costars
Mar 14 2019,negative,totally wack  wasnâtmt even funny or entertaining  no throwback to the source material  i think the marvel cinematic universe is at its âendgameâ if this is the future 
Mar 14 2019,positive,marvellous tm
Mar 14 2019,positive,had a really strong plot twist but the structure of the story was a little weak i give it four stars because its so different as a superhero movie however its only in the middle tier for my favorite marvel movies simply because the space concept was a little too ambitious with not enough context
Mar 14 2019,neutral,acting in it was fair story was boring in the action was none to be found iron man 3 is the only weaker movie of the marvel movies i have seen
Mar 14 2019,positive,captain marvel is an entertaining funny movie full of action and humor loved it so much that i purchased another ticket as soon as i left the theatre and watched it again the same day
Mar 14 2019,positive,a decent fun addition to the marvel universe good new hero simple premise and despite what people have feared not painfully tokenistic the dialogue once or twice was a tad clunky but no more so than the last half a dozen marvel films    honestly it truly hits its stride when it embraces the same kind of silliness that made guardians of the galaxy such a hit using a decent spoonful of nostalgia to create some laughs and acknowledging  through some pretty great dialogue and visual gags  all the  ridiculousness of aliens appearing out of nowhere and shaking up the status quo
Mar 14 2019,neutral,mediocre at best i dragged in spots and just left me meh couldâtmve been so much more and i was really hoping it would but itâtms not horrible i just wouldnâtmt waste my money seeing it in the theatre wait for dvd
Mar 14 2019,negative,ben mendelsohns awesome performance couldnt save brie larson falling flat in what could have been a much stronger character slj and goose the cat were fun even for someone not familiar with the comics the twists were predictable
Mar 14 2019,negative,the main character brie larson is either emotionless or just canâtmt act she added no dynamic cinematic variances of her character which made the movie blah the other characters at least could act better but the story line lacked anything worth building up to wait for the dollar movie or rent it as a daily wasted my money on it
Mar 14 2019,positive,great film a lot better than i thought it was going to be given the criticism it got before it opened
Mar 14 2019,neutral,pretty mediocre kind of a mess plotwise
Mar 14 2019,positive,i went to see âcaptain marvelâ with some friends and absolutely loved it itâtms very entertaining funny and has some really awesome characters    definitely worth a watch
Mar 14 2019,negative,no real character development and a premise relying on peoples anticipation for endgame i kept waiting for some real conflict or challenge but nothing engaging ever came
Mar 14 2019,negative,not as bad as thorthe dark worldbut still one of the worst marvel movies ever made so far i was expecting a lot better left theater disappointed iâtmve heard the jokes of captain feminism and all that negativitybut in all actualityit was brie larsonâtms lackluster performance that stood out it was like watching a very bad comedian tell jokes and wait for people to laugh it was just weird altogether i advise going to see it if you want to be introduced to a character that will play a major role in avengersendgame butdonâtmt go in looking forward to a good movie because itâtms not itâtms just ok
Mar 14 2019,positive,there were some moments which did not work for me but i was basically entertained during the whole movie and it is a standard marvel action movie opposed to the expectations from some critique i also enjoyed larsons performance
Mar 14 2019,positive,first half was slow second half what i came for overall good and funny
Mar 14 2019,negative,i cam into this movie super hyped for it but i just cant seem to get my motivation going to be hyped about it  i ignored all the stuff posted earlier dismissed it as men pissed about what larson said unable to separate the art from the artist  what i got on screen didnt have me pumping my fist in joy at any time like i did for iron man or captain america  i didnt get the feels that i was holding back during ant man about a dad trying to see his daughter again  i just had questions about why this seemed to be rushed to be shoehorned into the mcu  i would have preferred the writers taken the extra time and really gotten it right than this  no spoilers but there are some big continuity questions raised by captain marvel regarding nick furys injury and where the tesseract is during this time period  as for larson herself i just felt like there was something missing im not sure how shes going to fit in with established mcu characters  i think she did her best with what she was given but disneymarvel needs to take a serious look at their writing staff if the best parts of this movie were fury coulson and the cat
Mar 14 2019,positive,middle of the road marvel movie doesnt deserve hate just because the main actress got political some genuine laughs and a few good fight scenes all structured around a passable plot
Mar 14 2019,negative,great special effects cannot rescue this movie from crappy lead actress and weak storyline
Mar 14 2019,neutral,an ok movie but one of the least of the marvel movies  not overly entertaining and seemed to have a fairly predictable storyline  as much as i hate to say it dc has made better movies than this and that is tough for dc to do better than marvel  wouldnt pay to see again  heck wouldnt watch for free on netflix either  once is more than enough
Mar 14 2019,positive,i liked it a lot  the music was really good  the story was focused and self contained and about the carol danvers  development into captain marvel although whats weird is she never actually go called captain marvel in the movie   it was also cool to see fury before he was all dark cynical  and untrusting
Mar 14 2019,negative,although i enjoyed the 90s soundtrack as someone who grew up reading the comics about captain marvel this was a bit disappointing her cockiness reminded me of robert downeys as tony stark which didnt fit with the scenario of the film let alone she was able to harness her binary power with ease theres was no struggle in the fight scenes or emphasis of vulnerability that builds into her full potential if so it only lasted a second she was already great all she needed to do was remember and immediately knew to fly outer space and destroy the ships with a simple blast with no explanation or way of showing how she knew to do that i couldnt take any of the villians serious even jude law as yonrogg because marvel couldnt take them seriously when she could just defeat them with one blast a strong villian makes a strong super hero and i didnt see it the cat i mean alien cat was entertaining 5110
Mar 14 2019,neutral,25  5    con   1 a weird smile by main character throughout the movie in between scenes felt weird for that should have added something there than just making her smile in eye to eye contact scenes  2 the whole plot felt weak when compared to cap america and iron man  3 some really cringy things such as motorbike guy noone speaks like that anymore but i can understand as it was  like in 1980s  4 weird shot when marvel meets her friend as well felt like it was forced or something didnt flow smoothly    pro  1 action scenes were ok  good  2 at the end action scenes got a bit better and thrilling   3 goose played a crucial role 1410 would love to see him in endgame  4 i cant think of anymore good points
Mar 14 2019,negative,i went into this movie with a positive attitude excited that i would be watching the newest movie in the mcu i walked out extremely disappointed with the lack of character development and brie larsonâtms horrible acting the writers of this film shouldâtmve put more effort in developing the protagonist and they shouldâtmve casted the protagonist with an actual strong female actress
Mar 14 2019,neutral,not one of the better mcu movies i predict 6 affirmative action academy award nominations but truthfully it is in the bottom 5 of all the mcu movies in my opinion
Mar 14 2019,negative,bland humour boring action pokerfaced brie though the cat and fury were quite interesting to watch but all in all it looked recycled as if it was done on the rails from a movie scratched back in the beginning of 2000nds the main villain is just vapour even worse than in thor 2 the joke with cat closer to the end and cameo of phil coulson were est parts oh and also the stan lee marvel intro
Mar 14 2019,neutral,mediocre story dull protagonist disappointing villain spotty cgi compared to other marvel movies and poorly developed character arcs  inconsistent pacing  droll music choices  every performance but slj was bland   worst marvel movie yet
Mar 14 2019,positive,enjoyed it it was a great ride brie was great and so was samuel l jackson it was good to see clark gregg back as coulson highly recommended 
Mar 14 2019,negative,its trash  a poor movievery disappointing
Mar 14 2019,negative,substandard to the of her counterparts origin stories i donâtmt know why i expected a better movie then her comic origins
Mar 14 2019,positive,the movie was decent some great action and then some bland action some great comedy and then some cringy stuff some good music scenes and then some overdone music scenes brie had a lot of controversy going into this movie but i dont pay much attention to that stuff she did ok really good in some scenes but pretty mediocre in most but a totally decent job all and all a decent movie worth seeing on the big screen i saw it in imax 2d will i see it twice no but i will happily watch it at least one more time on streaming oh yeah and both end credit scenes are worth waiting for
Mar 14 2019,positive,the movie was excellent
Mar 14 2019,negative,strory is nice but such an easy fight villains are so weak climax is so plain
Mar 14 2019,positive,wonderful movie truly had fun seeing carol beat up the skrulls with glee
Mar 14 2019,negative,the confusing mess that is the opening 30 minutes is tempered only by brie larsons tongueincheek performance  even that is not enough to raise it to marvel status
Mar 14 2019,positive,i wont claim that this is marvels best movie but its definitely my new favorite the plot though occasionally predictable but lets be real what superhero movie isnt is fun creative uplifting and in my opinion well executed the movie itself was beautifully made with both the computer generated and filmed scenes demonstrated a lovely and exciting aesthetic clark gregg  and sam jackson both managed to portray younger less developed versions of their respective characters with excellence and i almost wish that marvel would just go ahead and give us a buddy cop style movie of their early shield days lashana lynch and akira akbar created a beautiful mother daughter dynamic and i adore the fact that the love of the movie was that of a mother and daughter with their lost and found loved one brie larson shines in the role and perfectly brought the confident cheeky captain to our screens and i greatly look forward to seeing her in the next wave of the mcu higher further faster baby
Mar 14 2019,positive,i was sceptic at first but i saw it in 3d and really like it the story was good
Mar 14 2019,positive,went into this movie with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised captain marvel finds the right balance between character moments action and overall is a fun movie with great references to the 90s jackson and larson deliver great performances and work well with each other   take the time to see this one which is one of the best marvel movies to date
Mar 14 2019,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed this movie after watching it i looked up reviews and i was surprised to see so much backlash against it mainly it seems to be for political reasons i unlike most am able to separate myself from my political views whenever i watching a movie i dont always agree with actors personal lives and political stance but i dont let that get in the way of my enjoying a good film  for those who thought it boring i get it this movie is an origin story so i think that should be taken into consideration was there as much action as there was in the avengers no but i was okay with that my only qualm is to those who complained about it shoving feministleft agenda down your throat i am a conservative and i didnt feel that way at all honestly nowhere in the movie did i get that vibe yes there was a scene where she had a flashback to a moment in her life where she was belittled by the military men around her but that isnt that big of a deal it took place in the military over 20 years ago stuff like that happened then i dont know why some people are so up in arms about it xd   i promise you if you do not go in looking for a reason to hate it then you wont feel that way
Mar 14 2019,negative,nice try but is not on marvelâs movies levels poor direction and poor script
Mar 14 2019,positive,loved the movie brie larson did a solid job and ben mendelsohn did fantastic
Mar 14 2019,negative,captain marvel split audiences into 2 groups before it even came out i wasnt into any of these internet wars or whatever youd like to call it i didnt have any high expectations for this movie but i had a tiny thought that it would be a good one the entire first act of the movie all i saw was an emotionless doll  brie larson neither does she smile nor frown maybe its the writing for the character of carol danvers but i didnt feel any emotional attachment for brie larson though larson puts all her effort into her performance i didnt like her character as it had zero charisma a friends reunion in the 2nd half of the movie didnt pack any emotional punch or me samuel jackson is great as a younger nick fury but his character doesnt have much to do in the movie one of the worst flaws the fight sequences are not up to the marktheres a scene where its so dark and you can barely recognize the characters overall i didnt enjoy this movie at all lack of proper characterization for carol danvers brie larson bad fight and action sequences sloppy narration make captain marvel a bland movie
Mar 14 2019,positive,this movie has the marvel touch that makes the movie enjoyable however there are some parts that feel like they are trying to pull the audience in and fall flat brie lawson isnt terrible in this role there are some parts that she absolutely kills it but there are other parts that makes you wonder if she was struggling to get in character that day sam jackson kills it as fury and doesnt disappoint overall it is worth a trip to the theater to watch
Mar 14 2019,positive,the movie surprisingly didnt have an overtly feminist message like wonder woman did it wasnt about a woman being a woman and wooping bad guys it was about a hero wooping bad guys gender unimportant really i can think of only one scene where her gender is involved and its played for laughs the character herself barely notes it honestly that scene is more a callback to terminator 2 than wonder woman    so no big social message about gender what it does have is satisfying action fun humor and an intriguing plot with good twists its a good entry into superhero movies which as my favorite genre earns it 4 stars
Mar 14 2019,negative,someone pushed me into this movie because i am not exactly a fan of superhero flicks honestly this one i should have skipped its a superhero without personality and the story is simple straight and boring probably the worst thing that could happen
Mar 14 2019,negative,average not up to par with current mcu
Mar 14 2019,positive,while i dont agree with what brie larson said it was a really good movie
Mar 14 2019,neutral,another character intro movie which tend to be bland ie ant man its no black panther thats for sure
Mar 14 2019,negative,not as bad or as amazing as most people say the sad reality of captain marvel is its incredibly forgettable forced and unnecessary nothing in this movie furthers the overall plot of the mcu     it feels both rushed and slow the editing or direction feels off no urgency to see this again id wait until its on netflix
Mar 14 2019,positive,while captain marvel does contain some rather too obvious feminist allegory this definitely does not detract from the quality of brie larsons performance she provides an incredible role model for young girls learning she is more powerful than she knows as the story progresses the film also contains less obvious racial and progressive themes concerning the skrulls and kree that not only provides an interesting twist but also comments on the dangers of xenophobia and misunderstanding
Mar 14 2019,positive,if the character ark was better shown it would be about as good as the first thor entertaining and mostly exciting for the future rather than whats was actually in the film the character ark seemed poorly fleshed out though i blame the director more than the actor the action was flat because she had no real equal the closest she had was that neck limiter that allowed them to shut off her powers once she burned through that it was just waiting to see how long it took her to beat everyone up boring doesnt deserve the hype some give it not the complete trash others are saying definitely the weekest marvel film since thor 2
Mar 14 2019,negative,very weak movie i understand the importance but it has the predictable and lazy script very weak effects and many cuts of action scenes making it difficult to understand
Mar 14 2019,negative,i did not like this movie and hope to the gods she is not made the big hero in endgame
Mar 14 2019,positive,amazing is the only word to describe the latest outing in the mcu such a great film that answers so many questions that previous films have proposed
Mar 14 2019,negative,its just so meh  only watched because it leads onto endgame  but if this is the future for phase4  sod it
Mar 14 2019,positive,a wonderful origin story setting the stage for a new mcu legacy
Mar 14 2019,positive,story is good but the piece by piece memory thing makes carols background story too flat too thin cant really feel for her makes the plot not much exciting
Mar 14 2019,positive,i enjoyed this movie it was entertaining and its awesome to see a female lead i am looking forward to bringing my daughter to see it i also liked the sound track a lot i did think the ending wrapped up a bit too quickly and neatly though it also just feels like cm has almost too much power she seems pretty much invincible between flying shooting energy beams etc
Mar 14 2019,negative,very dull amazing performances from samuel l jackson lashana lynch and ben mendelsohn but larson was a monotone bore and almost all action sequences underwhelming if you do not plan to see endgame in theaters just wait for this to come to video
Mar 14 2019,negative,1st 90 mins of the movie is just boring it picks up after that but the story makes no sense   in origin stories the hero trains and learns about their power and how to control it captain marvel went from having no knowledge of her powers apart from flaming fists to complete mastery over her powers in the blink of an eye  should have spent more time on exploring her powers and less with the forgotten memories
Mar 14 2019,positive,great start and background story  acting was terrific  larson better than expected for this role
Mar 14 2019,negative,sadly i didnå like this movie as i think would i felt like 3 different movies with different speed and theme  also i didnt felt any strong attachment towards main character  i hope in avengers it will be better
Mar 14 2019,positive,i loved it ive also been waiting 30 years to see her on the big screen this also said carol has a huge and in depth back story that had to be condensed into a 2 hr movie
Mar 14 2019,negative,there is no internal struggle the acting of brie larson was overshadowed by samuel l jackson in her own movie she also had acting moments her character was blunt and dumb always solved all her problems by being more aggressive and hitting harderand got served no humble pie the plot of the movie by the end of it makes you wonder  was it even worth watching this  as a standalone movie its mediocre but keeping in mind the directors  company behind it the bar being held up so high it shows all the more the difference between good writing  acting thor ragnarok  infinity war and bad
Mar 14 2019,positive,as a comic book movie fan this movie did not disappoint  departing from the usual origin format by jumping in to carol already having her powers but not really knowing how she got them was brilliant in that it allowed for instant action vs a slow build up of back story  then via flashbacks to feel like youre in carols shoes as far as how she really got to this point  is still figuring out what her life was before the kree took her in  it does leave some questions unanswered but thats no different than many mcu movies the answers will be woven into the fabric of avengers endgame  future mcu movies did they change some things from comic book origins yes but theyve stated all along that these movies are based on the comics but not ripped straight from the pages if that disappoints some then thats their issue looking forward to endgame
Mar 14 2019,positive,great film awesome plot strong female lead and female relationships depicted about time
Mar 14 2019,positive,the movie was exactly what i expected i admit there was some scenes in the movie that were not needed and also some that needed more in no way was this a bad movie i would definitely see it again captain marvel returns in avengers endgame and i canâtmt wait to see how the avengers and carol work together
Mar 14 2019,positive,amazing and thrilling
Mar 14 2019,negative,the movie is boring and predictable
Mar 14 2019,positive,i loved captain marvel  also wonder woman and on netflix jessica jones  we need more female superheroes and other diversity in our movies
Mar 14 2019,negative,larsen was a little dry the supporting cast was good a bit boring and by the numbers
Mar 14 2019,positive,you know anything about a lady blowing up a blockbuster witnesses say she was dressed for laser tag    the mcu marvel cinematic universe will soon complete its third phaseâthe first three phases are collectively known as the infinity saga april 26th marks the release of avengers endgame a film that will wrap up a 21film story arc that has spanned 11 years or almost 80 years in the universe itself the majority of these films outside of the first captain america film  1942 take place relatively recently starting with iron man which takes place in 2008 or 2011 depending on who you ask however captain marvel bucks this trend and takes us back to the mid90s    the movie travels back in time to a period of grunge music neon clothes fanny packs blockbuster video and dialup internet the world was a different place and captain marvel nails the nostalgia factor perfectly the film is far from perfect but still does enough to be a solid entry which has already grossed close to the billion dollar mark    the most interesting thing from a story standpoint is that its told in a reverse order to some extent the story unfolds as it goes forward oscar winning actress brie larson room plays the title character to the best of her abilities however she seems to be held back by directors anna boden and ryan fleck while not first time directors they dont have much of a track record outside of tv shows and some films even ive never heard of i dont think that they were able to bring out the best in a film that was awkwardly shoved into this universe serving as both a prequel and a sequel before the release of arguably the biggest cinematic event ever    thats not to say that the film is without its merits the story itself had several fun twists and turns the deaging of nick fury samuel l jackson and agent coulson clark gregg worked seamlessly the effects as always were some of the best in the business and of course marvels trademark comedy was able to break up any serious moments within minutes i do believe that we will see a different captain marvel when endgame comes out directed by anthony and joe russo well see a much better directed version of her and she will shine even in limited screen time    im curious to see where she goes in the future after endgame the mcu will be different and yet the same some have projected that captain marvel will be the new key that holds the universe together similar to what iron man was for the first three phases there have been rumors of a femaleonly team with the likes of black widow scarlett johansson gamora zoe saldana scarlet witch elizabeth olsen valkyrie tessa thompson or others joing together for their own film as well will she get another solo film will it take place in the 90s again or in the present day so many unanswered questions    as an interesting side note captain marvel was originally a hero first created for fawcett comics dc comics then sued them because of the similarity to superman dc gained the rights eventually until marvel sued dc because of the name captain marvel dc then changed the name to shazam and thats where we stand now thats why there is a shazam movie coming out within a month of this one comic history can be confusing
Mar 14 2019,positive,it was meh not funny like other marvel movies there were awkward moments when captain marvel tried to be be funny but it fell flat the funniest part was at the end with fury and a cat only reason to watch it is to prepare for end game however that wasnâtmt really necessary wonâtmt buy it on dvd cause itâtms not worth rewatching
Mar 14 2019,negative,didnt really enjoy it seemed to lack a proper background story and was overly political
Mar 14 2019,positive,pretty good origin story and loved samuel jackson  ben mendelsohn
Mar 14 2019,positive,captain marvel is the new addition to the mcu a nonlinear origin story of carol danvers aka ms marvel aka princess sparklefists aka captain marvelââ played by brie larson     this is the first marvel studios origin film to feature a female superhero âno noooo waitâ you waitâ not yetâ â and is also the unofficial âsetupâ to avengers engame film and explaining what in the hell is with the pager    captain marvel has no memories of her past and is struggling to control her new unknown powers in the kree skrull war but when a chain of events leads her to discover her past wioth the help of a younger nick fury captain marvel must find out where she came from to become what sheâtms truly meant to be    this film also introduces a new alien race of skrulls that are shapeshifting aliens that can infiltrate and take over anywhere by turning into anyone they can see the âkree skrull warâ was introduced in guardians of the galaxy and is the introduction to our world with carol danvers     the story structure of this film is a âdeconstructionâ of the origin film where typically you have your intro to the character inciting incident of powers the tests of their abilities struggles with the real world and so on captain marvel intentionally withholds information so that you learn about carol danvers as she is learning about herself this can be used really well and adds more mystery to the character but can be a very difficult tightrope to pull off if you have a lot to balance     so does captain marvel pull it off âeeeeeehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh    ok so the positives we all love positives    the 90âtms setting is pretty fun to have included and they were able to accomplish some special effects feats with clark gregg and samuel l jackson as a younger agent coulson and âfuryâ  their introduction to the movie was maybe one of my favorite parts because not only did they give their characters a âlethal weaponâ buddy cop vibe in a short amount of time that i was super into but the way the shot the entire sequence felt like a 90âtms movie which was a ton of fun    i liked the skrulls having practical effects done on them and also ben mendleson as the head skrull annette benning and jude law are on the kree side were pretty good performances overall     the action and all the special effects on captain marvel looked great her powerset is really fun to watch and see in action and yeah thanosâ you gon get the shit kicked out of you here     but and hereâtms where the comments come inâ when i walked out of the theater i really didnâtmt feel any attachment to captain marvel and might consider this to be one of the mid to lower teir marvel films in general    the main issue is the story i think marvel took a bold shot at telling the story this way but it help captain marvel as a character for me to need to connect and relate to her she doesnâtmt really feel a part of the story and alot of times kind of drifts in and out with one liners and quips but thereâtms not enough time spent on her growing as a character and us exploring where she came from that she ends up being somewhat underdeveloped    that is not taking anything away from brie larson as an actress room was fantastic and she is an oscar winner for a reason the story just doesnâtmt build her character enough    the story affects all of the characters actually annette benning and jude laws characters fall into the villain problem before we got killmonger and thanos because where we start with them we arenâtmt given any time to mine the characters and develop what could be interesting but it all is super surface level same applies to carols backstory where we arenâtmt given much time to explore her backstory only from one scene that i really loved but it was just that one sceneâ     the pacing is a little off for the first two acts the 3rd act is a visual spectacle and the effects on captain marvel are really cool    overall i feel marvel missed the mark on this one captain marvel is a big powerset in the mcu and hopefully in avengers endgame we get to see her as a fully fleshed out character but in the end when thinking of the over 10 years of the mcu i wish we had seen captain marvel introduced in a group film and we got the first female mcu film that we all deserveâ we willâ later no not yet later
Mar 14 2019,positive,loved it very entertaining and fun and i cant wait til the soundtrack comes out with all that 90s music definitely recommend
Mar 14 2019,negative,the overall tone of the film was lack luster at best no real depth to the character and throwing a new superhero into the mcu this late in the game and claiming them to be the most powerful hero in the mcu seems very unfitting and will definitely not conside well with the long time cast we have come to enjoy over the past decade of marvel films just seems that we would had heard about this important hero sometime before the upcoming release of endgame instead of forcing us to accept that heres your powerhouse hero with a rushed back story where we changed a lot of things and were not true to the comic book storyline very disappointing
Mar 14 2019,negative,just a boring film not as important as brie larson made it out to be
Mar 14 2019,negative,it had some funny moments and some of the actions scenes were pretty cool but overall it wasnt great or anything to awful feels like a less interesting episode in a long series of good episode i suppose some of the cinematography was good 
Mar 14 2019,positive,it was funny had beautiful visual effects and had a good story line canâtmt wait to see how she does in endgame
Mar 14 2019,positive,this movie was amazing without a doubt my favorite  thank you  im sad that some people dont like it just because its a woman
Mar 14 2019,negative,this movie had a few good elements but lacked the marvel touch great characterisation character development of main character  but poor expression of emotions by  larson this unintentionally makes fury feel like the main character which feminist fans should be outraged about     cat plot device despite being from the comics degrades creative storytelling      the movie lacks a strong villain to challenge the strongest avenger  if i was a woman i would be annoyed that even iron man 1 had a far stronger villain  cgi great below average flow  not marvels best work but still better than dc
Mar 14 2019,negative,was really looking forward to this movie but it was killed by its own hype as it was not able to live up to it bad plot and subpar acting by larsen she brought no passion to the character and she just didnâtmt fit the role
Mar 14 2019,negative,this movie was total trash
Mar 14 2019,positive,just awesome cant wait to see captain marvel on end game
Mar 14 2019,negative,very slow and boring the first part of the film special effects candy improves the last part itâtms not a bad film or a good film and certainly not a film to watch twice it could of been much more with better character back ground as well as the main character not having any weakness in the main plot itâtms the weakness in what they cannot do which makes superhero characters interesting the main character does not feel genuine or human she feels more alien then the aliens this is the first superhero with no weakness apart from flashbacks and getting beaten down if given more time and weight perhaps maybe however there is no legitimate struggles compare to the other marvel characters which is the films biggest problem there is a strong allegory throughout the film which if was the motive it seems it was by press interviews could have been best suited for a black widow movie
Mar 14 2019,positive,captain marvel was great fun  i really enjoyed the action and the on friendship with nick fury and captain marvel was great to watch  the 90s nostalgia added some good laughs
Mar 14 2019,negative,pretty bad got my money back but not my time
Mar 14 2019,positive,when nick fury samuel l jackson sent that message for an adapted pager seconds after thanos snap the expectation went up there after all almost a year ago we were awaiting the arrival of captain marvel brie larson as the potential heroine who would save the day in a universe that is in a lot of trouble and that was 50 decimated by the villain    and perhaps the biggest problem of captain marvel is that expectation generated ally too to other factors for example the threshold that some marvel films have hit a few years ago the work of director anna boden and director ryan fleck unfortunately can not be placed on the same shelf of films as black panther 2018 avengers infinite war 2018 captain america the winter soldier captain america civil war 2016 and guardians of the galaxy 2014 only to stay in some films of phases 2 and 3 of the marvel cinematic universe nor is it better than wonder woman 2017 just to compare it with the best dc has created in recent years    in fact captain marvel is an uninspired movie its action scenes are far from being among the best ever produced by marvel and fails to explore important aspects of the narrative around which the heroine was inserted    the question is why instead of showing the umpteenth origin story with the same tiresome elements that we have already seen in other films of origin captain marvel was not straightforward in the case the war between skrulls and krees one of the most classic stories in the comics    it is understandable the need to introduce the character after all so far in the movies carol danvers brie larson had never even been mentioned but the old bow who am i really where did i come from whats my job in the world why am i doing this what are you hiding from me  i finally rediscovered myself it seems a tiresome formula that leaves us with the impression that this story could be better told in another way or worse it seems like a lazy movie    of course looking at everything marvel has built up so far making the captain marvel movie in this format was a wellcalculated risk the studio bet on the late novelty of having a female protagonist in a film of superheroes while it was overtaken by dc at this point which launched well before the wonder womanâs movie and the numbers multiplying every day in the cinemas show that marvel at least from the economic point of view had made the right decision we hope she now has the boldness to move on and make the black widowâs movie so desired since the avengers 2012    however captain marvel turns out to be a somewhat anodyne film it has a confusing first part that refers to flashbacks to try to locate who is carol danvers a medium with a long rediscovery and accounts and an end that lacked the figure of a villain who really confronted her while she discovered the full potential of their powers for a race of warriors however the krees have given up very easily to face it only because it prevents some warheads from reaching the earth    the impression is that captain marvel served more like a movie like antman and wasp 2018 while it located the viewer where scott lang was when thanos snapped his fingers it served to give a fairly generalized overview of who captain marvel is before the inevitable confrontation with thanos in avengers endgame all the best seems to have stayed for an eventual second film especially the kreeskrull war    about brie larson the actress seemed to have been a wise choice for the role she is a good actress who does not have great performance but has qualities for the development of the character from now on and the partnership with samuel l jackson worked well in the film lets see what it will be like now that she will insert herself into avengers endgame    another positive point is the soundtrack as captain marvel takes place in the 90s the film brought a collection of hits from the decade with songs by garbage no doubt nirvana rem it was a trip back in time and full of references to the decade from the blockbuster network of movie theaters to tarantino but some songs seemed a bit out of place it did not make much sense to come as you are while carol confronted the supreme intelligence kree    captain marvel so got owed its ok fun but it looked like the best kept in store for the future
Mar 14 2019,negative,i never knew how stupid men could be portrayed untill i watched this
Mar 14 2019,positive,captain marvel itâtms what i needed to see been a fan of carol for 9 years and this movie represent what i loved about the character in the first place and more i love brie larson young slj is the cutest thing goose for life
Mar 14 2019,neutral,this movie was slow storyline was slow acting was ok but was mostly just ok not amazing not even great just ok
Mar 14 2019,negative,an interesting film unfortunatly not very memorible i place it right up there with antman  iron man 2 i think it was important to see before infinity war 2 and saw it opening night to avoid spoilers however wholesome yes enjoyable meh i probably wonâtmt be buying this to add to my personal collection kind of a shame
Mar 14 2019,negative,horrible movie horrible acting way too hyped up no where near as good as wonder woman or any other marvel movie for that matter
Mar 14 2019,positive,marvel doesnâtmt make bad movies that being said this one is on the lower end i have 0 desire to see it again in the theatre i donâtmt buy brie larson as a superhero  there was something lacking for me  its really a movie for little girls and women to feel empowered bymen secure in their masculinity wont think twice about the supposed hidden agenda lol
Mar 14 2019,positive,good movie not great but certainly good i went in expecting a bad movie from what everyone had been saying but by the climax of the movie i didnt even want it to end its a good story and i like how they changed it from the comics good characters good humour some forced but still funny through the little bit of cringe of them nick fury is always a great character and potrayed brilliantly by samuel l jackson coulson shows why we all love him from the first avengers and agenst of shield overall the movie isnt as bad as people wanted it to be or are making it to be its a quite enjoyable movie with a lot of action and a good story which has a shymalanian taste to it which definitely suprised me but enjoyed it nonetheless not sure on the level of her powers compared to thor or hulk as she seems to be holding back at times or not trying at least so definitely she could be the most powerful mcu character again good enjoyable movie and very humorous dont worry about brie larsons acting because she did the best she could with such a troubled character hence the stern looks in the trailers that had everyone worried it would be some emotionless potrayal all in all its worth the money and adds a lot more to the already packed mcu than i expected
Mar 14 2019,negative,for a film being slotted between two of the biggest mcu movie releases it left a lot to be desired the hype for this movie overshadowed its execution even for an origin story it felt half hearted there was nothing about this movie that added any value to my anticipation for end game if anything it has made me skeptical itâtms hard to get emotionally invested in a character with such a distant plot that dragged and created continuity errors it was by no means a bad movie but by the same token it definitely wasnâtmt a smash
Mar 14 2019,negative,took my two kids to see it yesterday 45 and it was honestly pretty awful neither if us were very entertained and decided to leave about 45 minutes into it and play on the video games in the lobby what is with all the horrible movies lately take me back to 2007
Mar 14 2019,neutral,decent not that impressed 
Mar 14 2019,negative,ok film but really not that great
Mar 14 2019,positive,super enjoyed the movie  while the marvel origin stories arenâtmt my favorites overall captain marvel was a lot more fun than captain america or thor  it doesnâtmt take itself too seriously tells a big compelling story concisely and the 90s jokes are on point
Mar 14 2019,negative,bree larsons acting was very lifeless the editing was super choppy the fight scenes were choreographed badly and with no style whatsoever the story is a generic origin story thank god samuel l jackson redeemed the movie a bit 
Mar 14 2019,positive,very good movie not c mix of comedy and action the reason it does not get 5 stars is due to the unlikeability of the main charcater the only reason this movie did not become a train wreck was due to samuel l jacksonâtms phenomenal performance all in all though really enjoyed apart from the scenes with only captain marvel
Mar 14 2019,neutral,honestly the characters lacked depth only scenes that were entertaining were those with fury not to mention the story is confusing and hard to follow 
Mar 14 2019,neutral,although it does fit mold of marvel formula it just seemed like an utter disappoint that infinity war doesnt set up very well it has all the makings of a good comicbook movie except for good writing brie larson does what script allows her to do but one must think that gal gadot did it ten times better with better talent would have preferred an emily blunt in this role but larson does a fine job i do think the dialogue takes me out of the movie too much for me to ignore samuel l jackson gives one of his better performances with marvel i didnt think the music meshed well with parts of movie which became a distraction i did think visual effects where par with marvel comic book films i mostly disliked the way they handled her character as it seemed like a character with virtually no flaws that is impulsive and overly confident which begs to question how can she do the stuff she does with ease when she is just learning her powers i thought the igorance is what sets her apart from someone like tony stark or steve rodgers who are different in personality but have vulnerability which carol denvers doesnt seem to have with how they wrote her please give her better writing cause this was a mess for a character that deserved better
Mar 14 2019,negative,posted a review four times now to no effect really frustrating to watch the plot makes you more confused the more you think about it there is no tension no danger and no growth when the credits roll the main characters name is carol the avenger no one calls her marvel or captain and she has no clear links to that name in any way
Mar 14 2019,negative,this movie sucked i wish i can give it a zero 
Mar 14 2019,positive,honestly brie larsons acting fell short here her acting was awkward most of the time and the humorfunny moments felt a bit forced i wish they put more thought into casting but whats done is done cant wait for avengers endgame though
Mar 14 2019,negative,1st hour of the movie was just boring 2nd hour was a little better but made 0 sense went from a novice to grandmaster of her powers in 5 seconds with 0 training or knowledge of her powers at all
Mar 14 2019,positive,its criticisms are greatly exaggerated although the movie has some issues i cant see myself watching it again but i really loved moments the parts i didnt like about it actually came afterwards when i thought about the film i loved how it fits into the mcu
Mar 14 2019,positive,i havent read seen any comic book of captain marvel ive heard of the name cm but thats it i could only imagine how exciting it was and has reached a new prospective for our generation it felt good an great music too enjoy
Mar 14 2019,positive,one of the best character origin stories keeps you entertained the whole time you may be unfamiliar with some characters if you are a newer marvel fan but it would still be an entertaining experience
Mar 14 2019,positive,captain marvel is an engaging and fun origin story for the titular character  it is neither significantly better or worse than most of the mcu
Mar 14 2019,positive,another classic 
Mar 14 2019,positive,no stakes funny at times competent acting kind of bored throughout it 
Mar 14 2019,negative,movie sucked not worth the watch
Mar 14 2019,positive,great movie a marvelous performance by brie larson and her costars and as an added bonus they and marvel beat the crybaby internet trolls
Mar 14 2019,positive,ive seen it twice already and its a good dose of marvel fun strong characters great action scenes a fabulous cat and a female role model for my daughter to dress up as for halloween good times i did find the movie title confusing considering there was no character called captain marvel but thats pretty minor in my eyes 
Mar 14 2019,positive,has the entertainment value typical of marvel films but falls short from truly standing out amongst its peers throughout the film it always felt like it wasnt leaning hard enough in any one direction a sentiment which is also true of larsons portrayal as the title character given the mix of directions that the comics have taken the character recently its not surprising that the mcu incarnation would suffer from a similar lack of identity 
Mar 14 2019,positive,the first ever women leaded movie of mcu is a must its like brie larson was bon to lead this role
Mar 14 2019,negative,i donâtmt like this movie
Mar 14 2019,positive,sorry trolls this is a great marvel addition 
Mar 14 2019,positive,went to the cinema with low hopes but i needed to watch it to understand more of endgamebut my expectation was way of the film was amazing
Mar 14 2019,negative,this movie is so fucking trash 
Mar 14 2019,positive,good movie good story kept me interested the whole time 
Mar 14 2019,positive,average mess that has a character that doesnt live up to expectations
Mar 14 2019,negative,captain marvel left me as emotionless as the actress throughout the whole movie the only highlight was stan lee and the cat
Mar 14 2019,positive,prob one of the best of the mcu enjoyed it from beginning to end great backstory
Mar 14 2019,negative,the aftereffects of the explosions on captain marvel are wiped out just like her emotions on the biggest part of the film she just dont get durty for some reason cant relate with her as a person or understand the reason for avengers name origin thats why i dont like disney movies when they try to make something els than fairy tails
Mar 14 2019,negative,wasted my money on this garbage
Mar 14 2019,positive,the movie makes the basic but it makes pretty well
Mar 14 2019,negative,i wanted this to be better in a postwonder woman world the bar is high for dynamic female super hero movies this one just didnt land for me
Mar 14 2019,negative,the movie is fun to watch but her powers are over powered they didnâtmt realy translate the origen of her power from the comicâtms to the movie also her learning to use this power could take 4 movies and not like 05 movie the did that great in thor but with captain marvel it feels to rushed
Mar 14 2019,positive,having watched a trailer that i thought would be fun to see with the kids i was especially glad i took my 2 daughters to see this film the super hero action films have been getting dull but this is definitely a much needed movie that hit all the right spots and a well done reflection of our times  im not sure what could have been done better but i hope to see a follow up focused on just her again  this is what i hoped ww would have been for my girls  but im glad it was done here with this movie and character  about time
Mar 14 2019,positive,great movie excellent action story line and empowering message for girls 
Mar 14 2019,negative,poor structure flat humour and a god tier main character turns out the way to beat thanos is just to add a bland character that is undefeatable
Mar 14 2019,neutral,meh not the best marvel movie 
Mar 14 2019,positive,i looked at the opinion of others everyone hates this film because they are biased because of the actress while people have a bad opinion about the film in my opinion the film came out successful
Mar 14 2019,positive,its a great film with so many virtudes and a great new female super hero
Mar 14 2019,positive,is it the best of the 21 marvel movies probably not but captain marvel has great pacing fun buddychemistry between brie larson and sam jackson and primarily it is a worthy torchbearer to the mcus decade long story arc i am giddy for the awesomeness that will be endgame get em cap
Mar 14 2019,positive,a deeply spirited agenda for a marvel universe film but it finds a way to entertain beyond its meaningand it does a good job connecting to the previous films is it the best marvel has to offer  i say no but you be the judge
Mar 14 2019,positive,entertaining i still love the avengers ensemble movies the best and am really looking forward to endgame that being said i thought this movie was pretty good i really liked jude law in his role and i enjoyed learning some of the origin story behind fury and coulson the one thing that would have elevated this movie for me would have been to have a different lead i thought brie larson was amazing in the movie the room but i just felt like her performance was flat in this one she had the look and the moves but i just thought he voice was very monotone and lacked real depth or feeling lashana lynch had passion in spades and was great as rambeau i liked the action at the beginning but the story was a little weak it was still enjoyable though just not one of my favorite mcu movies
Mar 14 2019,positive,as a movie it was very entertaining but as a marvel movie i felt it was underwhelming it felt as though they were more concerned with sending a political message rather than doing one of the strongest super heroes in marvel comics justice while she is strong in the movie a little to strong for the mcu they do a poor job of explaining what she actually is and what her powers are overall a entertaining movie that you should definitely see but fell short as a marvel movie in my opinion kind of like the first thor and captain america movies
Mar 14 2019,negative,not original tiresome and lecturing
Mar 14 2019,positive,not my fav marvel film to date that still lies somewhere between black panther and thor ragnarock but i truly did enjoy the film and larson was a great edition to the mcu
Mar 14 2019,positive,awesome movie if youre a marvel fan 
Mar 14 2019,negative,it seemed forced beginning was great but quickly dropped off into a slow drudge until she turned into all powerful mary sue not much conflict or character development
Mar 14 2019,positive,best marvel movie to date  brie larson is absolutely amazing
Mar 14 2019,positive,great entertaining movie loved everything about it
Mar 14 2019,negative,good origin movie decent superhero film
Mar 14 2019,positive,wasnt as bad as they made it seem could have been more action not as good as wonder woman but it sets up avengers 4 and got some nick fury backstory so worth seeing so stop hating and let the viewers judge 
Mar 14 2019,positive,extra 12 star to offset a threatened lonely patriarchal supporter
Mar 14 2019,positive,ive loved this character since i was a kid i enjoyed the deconnick run in the comics and this movie does not disappoint  the character is handled welltheres feminism but its not heavyhanded  there are tons of 1990s references one of them being the buddycop theme  its almost the collision of two buddy cop films furycoulson and carolyonrogg to make a third one carolfury  my normal gauge for movies is how soon i check the timeusually i make it to about halfway  ive made it through doctor strange avengers infinity war and now four viewings of captain marvel without checking the time
Mar 14 2019,positive,it was a good movie for what it was as a origin story it exceeded my expectations i look forward to seeing how captain marvel will be used in avengers end game 
Mar 14 2019,negative,pro  nice effects  90 nostalgia  cons  bad acting  bad story  plot holes  the people who made this dont know the story of the marvel films until now  it is a slap in the face for marvel fans  the politic agenda does not belong into the movies it divides the people by making them take sides
Mar 14 2019,positive,one of the best marvel movies ive seen coming back to watch it again with the whole family
Mar 14 2019,negative,it was the crappiest movie of all time it could not have been any worse
Mar 14 2019,positive,amazing movierecommend it 1010brie larson is phenomenal as carol danversand she just has so much charismathe humour is unique and genuinely funnysome parts of the movie are a bit cliche  predictable but it also has its fair share of plot twiststhe supporting characters also give life to the movie and are very lovable
Mar 14 2019,positive,it was great the detractors are really over thinking this
Mar 14 2019,positive,loved it  super fun
Mar 14 2019,negative,just terrible worst mcu movie ever iâtmm sure disney wish they had a redo on this one really missed the ball on casting captain marvel wasnâtmt connectable with a blah performance and lack of capturing anyoneâtms attention fury came off as a wuss who had no leadership skills or abilities to handle himself in a fight or any confrontation very disappointed and a missed opportunity to build on the mcu franchise
Mar 14 2019,positive,loved the movie had some really great hidden pieces of info and was very entertaining to watch
Mar 14 2019,negative,the worst marvel movie a huge difference in quality to what we are used to
Mar 14 2019,negative,a complete mess of a storyline  the action in no way makes up for a convoluted plot  one of the weakest mcu offerings to date
Mar 14 2019,positive,iâtmll admit i went to this film slightly worried that captain marvel would be another superman an alien superbeing that is not really very relatable this was not the case and marvel has handled this well   the story clips along at a fair pace with plenty of action and some great funny beats brie larsen walks a nice line between heroic and human making captain marvel a sympathetic despite her power level     the supporting cast do great work and i recommend the film
Mar 14 2019,positive,as a marvel fanatic this movie did not disappoint overall great movie
Mar 14 2019,positive,movie was ok nothing too inpressive did not have high expectations but yet was still disappointed
Mar 14 2019,positive,it was entertaining and fun what a movie is supposed to be
Mar 14 2019,positive,a really awesome film from start to finish    brie larson is a badass throughout with an excellent arc i was also amazed at the quality of the visual effects particularly the deageing tech     cant wait to see the character again in endgame
Mar 14 2019,positive,great hero movie great hero
Mar 14 2019,positive,excellent movie i especially enjoyed the callbacks to the 90s
Mar 14 2019,positive,i honestly do not understand why everyone is so adamantly against this movie as a story goes it is just as fine as all the other mcu stories the feminist part of it is just fine by me what do people expect in the nineties the first women pilots were deployed into war zones some of them got medals for their valor now this is all fantasy but at least they give us a woman who was strong and wanted to prove herself in a world dominated by men now as an mcu movie it has given us a glimpse into the future of the franchise and it looks bright it has also shown us perhaps the next villain of the mcu after thanos the supreme intelligence the plot twist was fine and im sure this is gonna come back in the following stories the mcu has come a long way and has farther to go 
Mar 14 2019,positive,so amazing iâtmve already seen it 4 times this week âï
Mar 14 2019,positive,rather good marvel movie a bit harder to follow which doesnt make it difficult enjoyed it
Mar 14 2019,negative,this film is very forgettable not to mention i was not a fan of the social politics
Mar 14 2019,negative,1 the plot was boringawful 2 brie larsons acting was roboticlifeless 3 the 90s stuff and cat humor was a fail overall waste of my moneytime cash grab
Mar 14 2019,negative,this movie was one of the worst ive seen in a while only saving grace was samuel l jackson and the cat the ratings on this site have been tampered with too
Mar 14 2019,positive,amazing movie its really sad to see the homophobic sexist reviews online this is 2019
Mar 14 2019,negative,very disappointing the cat was the highlight
Mar 14 2019,positive,it was ok lower of the mcu movies lately the acting was fine but comedy a bit forced as compared to some of the other funnier movies like the thor series or guardians
Mar 14 2019,positive,one of the best marvel movies the entire cast is wonderful but brie larson really and literally shines
Mar 14 2019,positive,just saw it i was pleasantly surprised it fits nicely in with the rest of the mcu films
Mar 14 2019,negative,fell asleep half way
Mar 14 2019,neutral,decent movienot the eath shattering movie some people are claiming it to be also not a total dumpster fire either issues i have with the movie are as followedslow pacingno real threat of a villain and the cgi was not on level of other marvel movies  outside of that it was a decent marvel movie glad i went on a tuesday morning showing
Mar 14 2019,positive,really awesome movienot sure why the ratings are as low as they are very fast paced and exciting 
Mar 14 2019,positive,a bit generic but overly accomplising
Mar 13 2019,negative,trash terrible choice of an actress it seems like marvel is hitting a slump nik fury was the half star dont see ir just rent it when it comes out really boring
Mar 13 2019,negative,was hoping for better marvel movie
Mar 13 2019,positive,every person needs a superhero and this superhero is for all those simple young girls who did not see themselves represented until now
Mar 13 2019,negative,very bad direction the protagonist does not connect with the character the worst movie in the marvel universe
Mar 13 2019,positive,okay heres the thing captain marvel is neither the worst nor the best marvel film to date and i dont get why it seems to be so polarizing movies like thor2 captain america or doctor strange have higher scores and those were far less fun to watch to me i dont expect great twists and groundbreaking stories from marveland i like this one because its more grounded the actors had great chemistry and the villians had actual motivation beyond i wanna destroy all 11  so dont expect a groundbreaking story or unseen twists and you should be entertained by this movie 
Mar 13 2019,positive,good fun movie that continues to build towards endgame and expand the mcu im really looking forward to where larson takes the character
Mar 13 2019,positive,a great introduction for the character into the marvel universe that avoided the classic origin story formula carols story arc made her feel understandably stiff and overly intense for a big chunk of the movie but left me looking forward to seeing less of the serious kree soldier side of carol danvers and more of the fun i scream at skrulls side of her in future movies
Mar 13 2019,negative,they  ruined the story
Mar 13 2019,positive,this was an amazing movie kid friendly  grownup friendly  great back story integration  and a hell of a good time in 3d
Mar 13 2019,positive,this movie was fantastic the notion that it was overly political is a joke just a funny good movie with a great performance from larsen and jackson  
Mar 13 2019,negative,i did not like this movie the first half was very slow and i found myself checking the time at several points brie larson was terribly miscast i felt no real tension or a connection to her character
Mar 13 2019,negative,worst marvel movie to date pure trash this is what happens when you put and push an agenda instead of trying to make a good movie dont waste your money they have ruined avengers just like they ruined star wars
Mar 13 2019,positive,had a good story told in a unique fashion however some scenes could have been better developed and characters flaws brought out like reckless but all in all fun typically marvel movie
Mar 13 2019,negative,where have i seen this before where havent i seen it before yet another action film with the same tired plot same cgi and same mumbled incoherent lines only this time its encased in a worn out marvel overcoat not worth the time to watch
Mar 13 2019,negative,couldnâtmt get past brie larsonâtms corny acting wasnâtmt worst movie out there but probably second least favorite mcu movie
Mar 13 2019,negative,im going to be honest i didnt know what to expect i had reasonably high hopes because of the track record of marvel     that having been said in my humble opinion there were way too many plot holes in the creation of the movie and the intelligence of most real comic book fans and quite a few movie fans should easily be insulted     ms larson was not the right choice to play this character her performance was as flat as cardboard even for the type of character she played samuel jackson annette bening lashana lynch ben mendelsohn and the rest of the cast were well placed and on point considering what they were given to work with  the formula of using a fractured memory build to a plot has been done to death in hollywood but i guess that the writer and director didnt get the memo   sfx were absolutely beautiful and the way that they turned back the clock for mr jackson and mr gregg was very nicely played i enjoyed a lot of the subtle and not so subtle nods to pieces of film  aviation history that were in place during the movie but even that wasnt enough to save it    for what this movie tried to be and what it really was it was a passable at best way to spend 2 hours that having been said if marvel is going to be this haphazard in casting future lead characters endgame will more than likely be my last marvel movie
Mar 13 2019,positive,this is a solid addition to the mcu brie larson portrayal of captain marvel is on point she is witty sarcastic emotional and a total bad ass with a lovable smirk the storyline is original and interesting with plenty of twists definitely looking forward to future movies and how it will tie in with endgame
Mar 13 2019,positive,by the end i was hooked and i intend to see it again the first third of the film was confusingit turns out that the confusion was deliberateknowing who can be trusted or even who is actually who they seem to be is a puzzle that both the audience and the nacent captain marvel must solve the journey back to 1995 is fun if you were using the internet during that eraloadingioading
Mar 13 2019,negative,mcu took one of the most uninteresting characters of marvel comics and have her a stand alone film captain marvels most memorable moment in comic history was falling in battle to rogue who not only sapped all her powers permanently but carol ends up in a coma the film felt rushed lackluster plot and now way too many holes because of the timeline of her introduction wait till its on netflix or at a cheap theater not worth the watch  cgi initially started out good but then took a turn of justice league cgi horrible
Mar 13 2019,positive,so much fun she is so powerful  look out thanos carol and goose are gonna fix everything
Mar 13 2019,positive,is this movie flawed yes more so than most marvel movies but is it entertaining and worth watching yes larson jackson mendelsohn and lashana lynch deliver the standout performances the action is fun it keeps up the humor and light tone the franchise is known for and it delivers a killer midcredits scene however its protagonist is not developed as well as any other hero who has been given their own film as well as select members of the supporting heroes like black widow falcon winter soldier and war machine the action is only enough to entertain you in the moment and wont leave much of an impact on you if at all overall captain marvel boils down to a lower mcu film that will pleasantly kill a couple of hours of your time but id still recommend it
Mar 13 2019,positive,one of my favorite marvel movies to date great story arc that keeps you on your feet and rooting for captain marvel  brie does an awesome job playing the role with her quick snap backs making her a real kickass bad ass
Mar 13 2019,negative,absolutely the worst movie i have ever seen iâtmm a huge comic book nerd and this movie just made me sleep during scenes  polictical wise wonder woman was absolutely amazing and they nailed everything about that character and you can feel her energy and how she was feeling first ever famale superhero and it was a blast marvel tried and absolutely failed i hope they get black window correct
Mar 13 2019,negative,way to op and long stretches of boring story
Mar 13 2019,positive,was very impressed with this movie she did such a great job as captain marvel
Mar 13 2019,negative,honestly worse movie i have seen in a while not worth the gas to drve to see it it lacked humor and had a terrible plot ans by no means was it the actors falt and in conclusion it ruined nick fury for me so definitely not worth the waste of time
Mar 13 2019,positive,humor action great characters and a plot that makes sense plus i loved the music great casting and weel done performances all around 
Mar 13 2019,positive,all around great fun 
Mar 13 2019,positive,wait for this movie to come out on dvd its not necessary to see it on the big screen enjoyed the 90s music but overall this movie is b o r i n g 
Mar 13 2019,negative,its marvel worst movie  they just wanted to create  a female lead movie  but donâtmt know how to build
Mar 13 2019,positive,captain marvel really lives up to its name its a brilliant girl power movie that isnt presented as a girl power movie they managed to take relatable harsh realities and weave them seamlessly into the fantastic world of the mcu and setting this specific story in the 90s couldnt be more perfect the characters are all fun and engaging the story is empowering and encouraging the humor fits so well in with the storytelling its easily my new favorite marvel movie i dont know if it has the potential for another best picture nod but it deserves it just as much as black panther
Mar 13 2019,positive,i think it was nostalgic funny shows women in a positive lite and the haters need to chill i have daughters and they too should feel they can do anything good actions some twist and hope she can help the avengers
Mar 13 2019,negative,captain marvel was an absolute litany of mistakes  brie larson didnâtmt give any life to the character and it seems like an actor playing a superhero rather than her becoming the hero  something weâtmve seen from many other marvel heroes actors the plot was like wet sandpaper and lacked an emotional pull on the watcher dancers felt inhuman even when after she supposedly accepted her humanity each achievement she got felt empty and samuel l jacksonâtms nick fury had to provide both comedy and vigor to the scenes this movie is vastly unwhelming and even the action scenes donâtmt elicit much interest
Mar 13 2019,negative,sloppy story with unbelievable twists
Mar 13 2019,negative,worst marvel film they rewrite the history is like a precuel but screw with all the pictures weve already seen omg nad what about the villain jude law is not a bad actor but please can you at least make him a little bit stronger was like an ant fighting an elephant final scene the battleships totally unnecessary was more like a filling so bad movie if you are not seen it yet please skip this one have nooooo relevant over avengers end game
Mar 13 2019,positive,good but its definitely not as good as it was hyped up to be
Mar 13 2019,positive,captain marvel continues marvels winning streak even though the film suffers from some fast pace and plot holes
Mar 13 2019,positive,the movie was amazing and exciting
Mar 13 2019,positive,ranks among the top 4 marvel movies strong characters that interact great with each other very funny and cgi is getting better with each marvel film the only complaint is i wish the plot was a bit more linear as it appeared a bit scattered and the green aliens were portrayed a bit inconsistently they  went from being the very intelligentsinisgter to goofy to human like i get we want to show empathy and complexity to aliens and other characters but it just seems they fooled too much around with them
Mar 13 2019,negative,it did a couple of things really well the special effects were off the chain there were a couple gems of dialogue the intro sequence of the ambush on the planet was awesome and the lore they had a bunch of small nods to great marvel canon in there however everything it did well it did equally horribly in many parts the cat was terribly animated in several spots the dialogue through the vast majority was atrocious the acting was the worst ive seen in a marvel movie even from jackson the plot was paper thin and had major holes the tesseract was not able to be there wtf the characters were not acting like they should jackson and the cat capt marvel had way more power than she ever did in the comics invulnerability and breathing in space are not in her suite and the pacing and order of the film was bad the marvell character was butchered too just like star lords dad so they screwed with canon as much as they nodded to it
Mar 13 2019,positive,excellent action great humor wonderful world building extra bonus of answering some questions left hanging in most recent avengers film captain marvel is an awesome addition to the genre and i cant wait to see more films with captain marvel featured
Mar 13 2019,positive,love the action  love to see fury and captain marvel
Mar 13 2019,positive,i loved this movie it was smart funny well written captain marvel made me realize how nostalgic i am for the â90âtms sam jackson and brie larson being goofy and having a good time together i hope they enjoyed making this movie as much as i enjoyed watching it i will definitely see it again thank you marvel
Mar 13 2019,positive,glad that the haterstrolls were defeated this movie is certified fresh and not only connects with infinity wars but is a great origin story full of girl power something that the  marvel cinematic universe needed if you havenâtmt seen it please do
Mar 13 2019,positive,four stars for being a decent movie five stars to cancel out the teenage boy trolls who feel threatened by a female superhero and thus downvote it
Mar 13 2019,neutral,over all an okay movie dont expect too much     pro   humor was not over baring or feel too force compare to justice league i like it  stan lee cameo was nice  interesting origin story as how the avenger initiative got its name from     con  no character development there are no change of internal character like iron man or change in how a character view the world like captain america no personal sacrifice or hardship either   super op power that leaves the mc with kind of superman dilemma   honestly more woman bashing in the first 30min of the movie than ive heard or seen my entire life but hey gotta make the message clear right sigh  story was really predicable you seen flag rise about an event clear as day and you know exactly how this event will turn out 20mins later yep turn out just like you imagined it    personal con  how nf lost one of his eye was quite disappointing    overall  this movie feel more like a dc movie than a marvel movie the story is meh character is meh ending is definitely too wishywashy especially right after we just had thanos delete half of the universe population
Mar 13 2019,negative,what a waste of time this could have been so good but they had to go and make men look like the enemy brie larson looked literally lost in this role and the skrulls as refugees kevin feige your so much better than this the mcu took a monster l for this
Mar 13 2019,positive,amazing thanks marvel
Mar 13 2019,positive,hohum movie the cat and samuel l jackson were the highlights doesnt tie in well to the other movies doesnt follow the comic book story felt a bit rushed compared to the other movies marvel has done
Mar 13 2019,positive,2 hours went by very quickly  entertaining movie  a little different than other mcu movies but thats not a bad thing
Mar 13 2019,negative,worst movie in the mcu poor acting cat was best part of the movie not worth the ticket price you are not missing anything if you skip lets hope they didnt just ruin end game 
Mar 13 2019,negative,was ok just wish certain things were different 
Mar 13 2019,negative,disappointed in this movie not up to marvel standards 
Mar 13 2019,positive,it is obviously not perfect to the comic books however as an independent piece it is very entertaining and well done i thought larson was wonderful and enjoyed watching the charters development throughout the film i was a little put off by the lead skrulls transition as a character otherwise loved it
Mar 13 2019,positive,changing my rating from 4 to 5 stars because of haters this movie is really good
Mar 13 2019,negative,all actors did fine but the plot was absolutely terrible definitely the worst marvel movie the movie was slow paced and boring with no excitement iâtmve seen a person sleeping during the movie and i wasnâtmt surprised this movie is one of the worst iâtmve ever seen definitely not worth any money to watch
Mar 13 2019,negative,i saw the movieall was my fault as iwas expected more from it the origin story really lacks the punch compring to iron man captain americadr strangethe only best is the cat goosebri larson is terrible being captain marvelthe cgi was great expectation ruined the icon
Mar 13 2019,negative,honestlyjust okay actually bad given the anticipation as it relates to avengers endgame the first captain america was not that good so hopefully captain marvel gets better also
Mar 13 2019,negative,this movie is trash donâtmt waste your money go see something else they ruin avengers with this trash smh now i canâtmt even see end game being anything but trash okay seriously the movie is bad straight trash
Mar 13 2019,neutral,move was mediocre at best a decent injection for avengers but i left with nothing no conversation  no interest in seeing it again without jackson it would have been worse
Mar 13 2019,positive,captain marvel herself is charming and brie larsons performance elevates a rather simple character  while the movies themes of female friendship emotional control and war are very mature the plot can feel messy and bloated  a fun watch but hope they streamline the story for the sequel  also bless goose
Mar 13 2019,positive,i liked the movie but it preached too much for me im an old white guy so i wasnt the target audience i still liked it but in my opinion wonder woman was much better got the same point across with less preaching 
Mar 13 2019,negative,the acting was forced and lacked conviction plot just kind of drug on with no action for a comic movie felt really flat
Mar 13 2019,positive,great movie seems just like the first avenger movie has a story line and action too
Mar 13 2019,positive,i loved this movie so much it was fun it was smart it was funny it had action it had a good plot and it filled in holes in the mcu  and opened up others to be wonderfully filled in in the future so good
Mar 13 2019,negative,bland story and performance
Mar 13 2019,positive,i went in with a critical eye but absolutely loved it i honestly thought id be disappointed because of all the politics surrounding it etc but it was seriously a great movie my 11 yr old son loved it as well
Mar 13 2019,negative,expected a lot with the hype artificially inflated movie but its a just a below avg movie with guns fitted in hand
Mar 13 2019,positive,great movie honestly the trailer had me think it might be just okay storylines and acting but after watching the movie i definitely loved it a lot cant wait for her to appear in end games now
Mar 13 2019,neutral,the plot is nothing special but brie larsons performance is on point
Mar 13 2019,positive,donâtmt listen to the haters out there an integral movie in the marvel universe that has a great storyline with strong and complex characters donâtmt get fooled by bad reviews or the slow start a must see if you love marvel but letâtms me honest itâtms no black panther
Mar 13 2019,negative,do yourself a favor and wait for it to come on hbo for freefeeble attempt at humor uninspired acting i was hoping for a good marvel movie like the winter soldier but instead what i got was a very mediocre movie
Mar 13 2019,positive,great movie i know why it was released on international womenâtms day a lot of good background on the characters so ready for avengers
Mar 13 2019,positive,there is an actual story not just crash boom and bang  looking forwarrd to seeing again and for the kids to see a strong roll model showing perserverance counts
Mar 13 2019,positive,fun lighter tone movie that shows captain marvels strength and power going into end game
Mar 13 2019,negative,the acting was flat it came off as bratty and really ruined any sort of emersion the storyline also seemed a little broken
Mar 13 2019,positive,i really enjoyed it watch it and make your own judgement on it before you choose to rate it brie larsonâtms comment was pretty aggressive and not a fan of her but this movie is just awesome cat people will also love it haha
Mar 13 2019,positive,really enjoyed myself watching this movie seeing phil coulson again and fury doing grunt work was great a few forced by jokes and obvious messages but nothing too in your face to distract you from a great marvel movie
Mar 13 2019,positive,it was a perfectly decent movie and had a lot of great messages the feminist tone really doesnt feel as forced as many say it does but even though it was a pretty good movie overall its still not in my top 5 mcu movies civil war will always be number 1 for me iron man and winter soldier share number 2 infinity war number 3 avengers number 4 and homecoming is number 5 but captain marvel is probably number 6 at least overall good movie and just dont believe everything you see online
Mar 13 2019,positive,fun lots of action and love the fury back story angle
Mar 13 2019,positive,solid film easy character to get behind good old âhumans have a little something extraâ kind of story
Mar 13 2019,positive,best origin story so far
Mar 13 2019,neutral,it was a very weak marvle movie comedy weak
Mar 13 2019,positive,the best mcu film ever the script of the movie is so strong brie larsons performance as carol danverscaptain marvel is excellent powerful and unique i must say that the visual effects are amazing captain marvel is an excellent movie full of action excitement with many agile fighting scenes its a rollercoaster ride in a complex and thrilling plot full of surprises since the beginning until the end captain marvel is the movie of the year
Mar 13 2019,negative,bad script and blurry visual effects
Mar 13 2019,positive,fun movie brie larson is amazing 
Mar 13 2019,positive,fantastic rollicking good time great story strong characters and superb action a home run
Mar 13 2019,positive,loved it another great story from the mcu
Mar 13 2019,negative,boring central character no development no personal growth not recommended
Mar 13 2019,negative,generic forced message   did not enjoy
Mar 13 2019,negative,honestly the worst marvel movie ive ever seen the story is all over the place and her character is a disaster brie larson was the wrong choice emily blunt shouldve made done this roleand she wouldve rocked it
Mar 13 2019,negative,watched it today and it was a very underwhelming experience brie larson is uninspiring throughout the whole movie although the 90s vibe had a cool nostalgia to it it didnt contribute much outside of that
Mar 13 2019,negative,worst marvel movie since the hulk messes up the teseract timeline lame soundtrack didnâtmt feel like an mcu movie even felt like they werenâtmt even marvel or comic book fans broke with a lot of comic precedent movie showed disregard and disrespect towards the comic and mcu history it also felt a little judgmental and like it was pushing agendas which further detracted from this being the good film it should have been movie was patchy and fragmented no real back stories so no emotional attachment to them so much more wrong but this movie already stole enough time from me
Mar 13 2019,negative,it was not what i expected i did not like the movie
Mar 13 2019,negative,this movie is just bad so many cheesy dialogueconversation unnecessary montage bad music score
Mar 13 2019,positive,classic marvel character development mixed with humor and storylines that tie together lots of fun and went by quickly
Mar 13 2019,negative,it was finethe effects were nice some of the supporting characters were engaging others cardboard the protagonist felt more like a supporting character
Mar 13 2019,negative,bad movie the worst movie of mcu
Mar 13 2019,positive,great movie dont listen to the critics 
Mar 13 2019,positive,fantastic what a ride
Mar 13 2019,positive,awesome   tricky twist on the after credits clip 
Mar 13 2019,positive,the movie was a lot better than i thought it would be iâtmd say see it for your self i recommend this movie certainly not the best marvel movie but certainly not the worst
Mar 13 2019,negative,this movie isnt the the last jedi of the mcu it is the solo of the mcu it is very average the script is sloppy with a lot of mistakes missed opportunities corny dialogue unnecessary origins timeline meddling and a lot of tryhard humor     its not the worst movie youll ever see but it isnt worth full price it also isnt necessary viewing for end game if youve seen the trailers then you know all you need to know about the character for end game
Mar 13 2019,negative,i watched this going in with no expectations putting aside all of the political discourse trying to be fair to marvel studios however i was very disappointed with what i saw they tried to use the nostalgia of the 90s and the marvel formula and it unfortunately did not reach the standard marvel movie jokes fell flat i couldnt invest in carol danvers because she had no real conflict or challenge to overcome i equate this to superman in justice league the feminism was not as bad as i thought but it was still shoved in our faces for no real reason other than to say i am woman look how strong i am the other issue i had was the illegal immigration topic they tried to sneak in here with the skrulls i did not like the comparison of the skrulls to the current immigration issues going in right now the skrulls were wasted as a character in the mcu if you are a fan of the mcu wait on watching this movie until it is put on netflix its not worth the 15 dollars for a ticket
Mar 13 2019,positive,movie was decent to good slj carried the movie surprisingly 
Mar 13 2019,negative,another marvel movie not the best not the worst  seems like a filler movie to get to the next avengers
Mar 13 2019,positive,i loved the film it was great fun
Mar 13 2019,positive,this is a fantastic film its a rare thing for a super hero movie to be subtle but there are subtle compelling details throughout and the narrative arc was compelling instead of reductive see it
Mar 13 2019,positive,the two issues ihave with the movie bring it down to a 35 1 as a comic book fan and a movie fan i understand they will change some things up in a character to make them better for the role of the movie but changing the gender of marvel was only because men suck 2 to stoic and not enough humanity nothing to root for no danger  but other than that it was good
Mar 13 2019,neutral,not the worst mcu movie out there at all all the action scenes were amazing as is the start to the story felt kinda rushed at the end wish they would have introduced her character earlier is all excited to see how this all plays out in the next run of mcu movies worth going to see
Mar 13 2019,negative,the movie is okay not the best marvel movie by far but much better than the incredible hulk  captain marvel was just not a likable hero and i felt like she did not care about anyone else but herself she is probably stronger than superman and because of this i am afraid what she will do in endgame as a single photon blast or whatever will probably destroy thanos
Mar 13 2019,neutral,captain marvel is a generic superhero movie with the tried and tested mcu superhero formula 21 movies in and the mcu still hasnt got rid of its strong villains problem captain marvel is shown to be too op literally crashing through tons of fighter jets in a scene and making ronan a joke and theres the age old twist of the horribly looking people turning out to be the good guys after all the only good things from the movie were flerken the post credits scene and the dynamic between samuel jackson and brie larson overall its the weakest movie of mcu phase 3 but it serves the purpose of introducing us to the character of captain marvel and getting us more hyped for endgame
Mar 13 2019,positive,its a good but not striking movie
Mar 13 2019,positive,it was a solid marvel movie
Mar 13 2019,positive,for a number of reasons i was very nervous for this film i did not want to see any feminismpolitics stuff brought into our beloved mcu i want to get attached to reportedly our new leader of the avengers after endgame which is why this was one of the most surprising films i have seen this year so far    we get our typical awesome marvel action sequences though i felt that there were no really really good ones to look back on there is a twist towards the 3rd act of the film that i really liked the cgi on samuel l jackson was remarkable and he and brie larson had terrific charisma throughout the entire film and obviously both actors were really good in it the emotion in the film was really good once we meet a certain character in the second act and those scenes actually hit me in the feelings which i love oh and the credit scene has me incredibly hyped for endgame however this film isnt flawless and i do have a few gripes with it    there are some bad cgi moments but not a lot reason i have to point it out is because of how noticeable it was for me my biggest problems come with some of the editing and pacing in the beginning of the film that was really bad as well as the way nick fury loses his eye if you saw the winter soldier you know that line he says to cap the last time i trusted someone i lost an eye yeah that line has no meaning now as well as the way the avengers get their name in the first place there is also a confusing scene towards the beginning of the third act and a very poor music choice for a fight scene in the third act    not a flawless film but a very fun one nonetheless i am going to give captain marvel a b
Mar 13 2019,positive,darn good  better than the reviews might suggest brie larson makes it excellent actress has more human element than other marvel productions
Mar 13 2019,positive,i loved it great add to the marvel universe hit all the right notes
Mar 13 2019,positive,this was a much better than average superhero movie i liked that carol danvers was played as a hero self made not born i loved the mystery that dogged the plot all the way through 
Mar 13 2019,negative,the movie went too far from the source material to the point where it felt like a completely different characterthen brie larson is real uninterestingboring and overall is not a good superheroit wants to be a strong womens empowerment movie but falls so short when the movie does things like change the original captain marvel to a women because the movie is a big feminist fan service movieat the end of the day the movie is saved because of the always good acting of samuel jackson and clark gregg as nick fury and agent coulson  with the help of the rest of the cast except brie larson
Mar 13 2019,negative,had nothing special about it just an excuse to make a sjw super hero it would have been a different story if it was at least entertaining like wonderwoman 
Mar 13 2019,positive,the movie was okay it wasnâtmt the best marvel movie but i donâtmt think itâtms the worst either it would be better if they leave politics out of it
Mar 13 2019,negative,captain marvel tries to be more of a women breaking out of chains movie rather than focusing more on the story and pleasing the majority of its audience their direction was all well and good only to be witheld by abismal writing and over used one liners this movie only gets interesting after everyone stops talking but youll have to make it to the last quarter of the movie
Mar 13 2019,negative,the movie had a really weak villain was pretty predictable and it got boring for most of the time only good thing it had was some cool cgi effects
Mar 13 2019,negative,this movie completely disregards the source material starts off slowly and limps into a overly cgi climax characters interaction was flat and uninspired marvel missed the mark on this one 
Mar 13 2019,positive,absolutely loved it  been a fan of the charter for a long time but disappointed with the continual string of reboots in the comics  hoping that the film and mainstream attention will give the comics a more stable base   the character change of marvell was a bit of a shock but its easy to understand the change   stan lee tribute was excellent as was his cameo and the wonderful tip of the hat to kevin smith
Mar 13 2019,negative,the movie was very dry and not exciting at all  i was looking for to this movie all year and now i am kind of worried that endgame might suck because of it  hopefully captain marvel 2 would be a lot better just like the winter soldier was better than the 1st captain america movie
Mar 13 2019,positive,screw the bots  this was a fun film
Mar 13 2019,positive,very entertaining popcorn movie
Mar 13 2019,negative,wow i really wanted to like this movie but it seems like they didnt even try 
Mar 13 2019,negative,save your timemoney horrible movie
Mar 13 2019,positive,i have no clue what movie all the men here have seen this is in the same vibe as guardians of the galaxy if you didnt enjoy guardians then youll hate this if your only beef with this movie is that brie larson underplays it then you do not understand at all the references to the 90s nor nerd culture nor how one plays ptsd    brie plays danvers a soldier who has been robbed of her identity her past her culture everything and she plays it subtly apparently too subtly for the neanderthals who think she is a bad actress not only this but she is also supposed to be a kree soldier who we learn very early on are supposed to suppress their emotionsin my opinion the subtle ways in which she expresses the carol danvers side of her personality are perfectly inline with these requirements for heavens sake this is the website that praised jlaw and seems to have an uncanny love of kirsten dunst larson has more range than any of these actresses    the film isnt the best marvel yes that in my opinion belongs to black panther and i would have said guardians 1 before endgame but now i hate starlord so much that its hard not to think about how whiny his character is in endgame     the 90s references are on point from radio shack to blockbuster the soundtrack reminded me so much of high school    its clear that this movie is the victim of the same phenomenon that black panther fell to in the very first moments of reviewa number of people here have decided before seeing this that it is bad and therefore given it a star or a star and a half even iron man 3 and avengers age of ultron have better audiences scores than this movie and those two were some of the crappiest marvel movies venom excluded of course this tells me all i need to know about these reviews they arent about the film they are about the message of the film    having been a fan of buffy and particularly the last season and my favorite episodes are definitely not written by joss wheddon so dont start with me i loved the visual of all carols picking themselves up and i absolutely roared with laughter at the lets brawl like men scene this is the way all supes should deal with over verbose ennemies of which ronan was one of the worst incarnations     im still not fond of marvel baddiesthey are too often onedimensional this movie is no exceptionthe baddies are nowhere near the quality of killmonger and the movie suffers a bit from it     all in all it was fun explained a few plot holes in the mcu and did a good job at linking to endgame and for all of you out there who are nostalgic about the 1990s supernatural shows and tech its a funny throwback to some buffyesque times     im giving this 5 stars because it deserves more than 63
Mar 13 2019,positive,well executed origin film  a double origin film really  set in the 1990s  most enjoyed the moving narrative arc of overcoming that carol danvers character goes through and the touching relationship between her and her old air force flying buddy and daughter  weve never seen those kinds of stories in a marvel story  nice to have a film too that passes the bechdel test in so many ways  shame on so many critics inability to even see this or mention it in their reviews too
Mar 13 2019,positive,fun characters awesome 90âtms jams and brie larson makes a wonderful superhero makes me want to be one too hahal
Mar 13 2019,positive,an enjoyable ridebrie larsen is terrificthe trolling against this film was ridiculousthoroughly recommend it
Mar 13 2019,positive,great movie  ties in well with the mcu
Mar 13 2019,positive,this was better than i thought going in not my favourite marvel movie but definitely in my top 10 brie lawson did a good job portraying captain marvel loved the chemowith samuel jackson looking forward to avengers 4
Mar 13 2019,positive,glad i didnt pay attention to the audience reviews you dont need to pay attention to mine either haha when it first came out i really enjoyed it go see it for yourself and form your own opinion ill just say its definitely worth seeing 
Mar 13 2019,positive,most definitely in my top 5 mcu movies maybe this isnt a movie for everyone but in some ways it felt like a superhero movie made just for me
Mar 13 2019,positive,dont believe the rotten tomatoes low criticaudience score i became a member just to write this review this movie is empowering badass and heartwarming all at the same time 5 stars allllll day 
Mar 13 2019,positive,it went straight with the comic however i would have put this is front of all the avenger movies in order to stay true to timeline 
Mar 13 2019,positive,while this is a good movie is it is not a great movie that being said brie larson has a bright future ahead of her as captain marvel she clearly has what it takes to be the kind of anchor character marvel is hoping for her to be     the film mostly suffers in the first half which is unfortunate because for some by the time the movie really gets going it may be too late that however was not the case for me the first act in particular is boring badly written clunky dialogue little character interest and lackluster performances from most once sam jackson enters the film however things really start to get better quickly pretty much everything between sam jackson and brie larson is magic its a shame the movie didnt open with them because it would have done a lot the third act is wonderful and really soars through the finally it left me want more much like the movie itself also goose its all about goose more goose all the time
Mar 13 2019,negative,the action scenes were literally the only redeeming part of this film
Mar 13 2019,positive,its a fun marvel pic if you like comic book movies you wont be disappointed some of the reviews ive read are just plain ridiculous  people just trying to how expansive their vocabulary is in an attempt to bring down this movie as if its not like citizen kane its not a good movie  it only proves how obnoxious they are and it no way reflects upon the validity of whether this is a good movie it is a good movie is it the best movie ever no but it doesnt have to be to be good or fun or worth seeing which it is all three
Mar 13 2019,negative,what sort of message are you trying to send by making a so called âfeministâ character to empower young girls without actually giving her any effeminate traits youâtmre basically saying that women and little girls canâtmt be strong unless theyâtmre men otherwise a standard movie with a standard movie plot and standard movie potholes in great abundance with little tie ins to its source material but i guess that might actually be to the movieâtms credit in this particular case as i donâtmt recall captain marvel doing fairly well in sales numbers
Mar 13 2019,negative,boringboringjust boring
Mar 13 2019,negative,quietest movie iâtmve been too none of the jokes landed captain marvel was too over powered
Mar 13 2019,positive,quality marvel film they have the super hero movie down  doesnt matter what a bunch of whiny incels and toxic comic fans say its a good flick
Mar 13 2019,positive,we went as a large group to see captain marvel 4 adults and 6 boys aged 13 we knew that the film was going to be hyped up by the studio and blasted by the misogynistic haters  i am just an average father who loves the movies and this was no exception  my wife doesnâtmt like superhero movies except aquaman for obvious reasons but she really enjoyed this as did 5 of the boys one has a problem sitting still for more than an hour so struggled with the length  the movie had the right formula of special effects to dialogue and story telling however it did seem a little rushed in the plot line around the kree with some obvious omissions the comedy parts lightened the mood and were perfectly timed brie larson was perfect for the role and despite the detractors attempting to silence and demean her abilities in the role she carried the movie exceptionally well with the aid of samual l jackson and jude law being the great character actors they are  overall this was a great first outing and now itâtms time to see how she will fare in a crowded avengers endgame donâtmt be put off seeing this movie by haters on social media and youtube give it a fair chance and you will be rewarded   movies should be about losing yourself for a couple of hours and not an indepth discussion of a characters previous origins to do so is simply over thinking it
Mar 13 2019,negative,the worst marvel move so far brie larson is just not a good superhero she is unlikable and always has this smug look on her face the best parts of the movie come from samuel l jackson and a cat definitely wait for this one to come out on video then rent it
Mar 13 2019,positive,it was captain marvelous donâtmt listen to previous haters most of them just didnâtmt like having a female led superhero film well if that was the case then may i remind you about wonder woman she too had previous haters before her premiere  had some after it but that film gained more love than hate  so will captain marvel it provided great performances especially the works of brie larson  samuel l jackson whoâtms chemistry was strong it also gave a surprisingly shocking plot twists in comic book adaptations but i wonâtmt spoil anything for those who didnâtmt see it yet  the story was well focused some of the visuals couldâtmve been better but most of it was more realistic than black panther no hate the action was intense the humor was hilarious the drama was well done overall itâtms a solid movie
Mar 13 2019,negative,not good  plot was disjointed  nothing about the movie was smooth  i spent the duration of the movie irritated
Mar 13 2019,positive,pretty good movie and interesting origin story good setup for more to come
Mar 13 2019,negative,main character was super bland  just nothing there but a script reading  ill be glad then ai gets good enough that we dont need real actors anymore  they just are not what they used to be
Mar 13 2019,positive,honestly this is my favorite superhero brie larson was phenomenal as was the rest of the cast plan on seeding it multiple times hilarious thrilling beautiful tribute to stan lee what more could anyone want
Mar 13 2019,negative,watched it cuz i love marvel movies but i really disliked it acts want convincing as tough not did i think she pulled off the humor avoid
Mar 13 2019,positive,really entertaining
Mar 13 2019,positive,went to see captain marvel and it was a kick ass thrill ride brie larson gave a phenomenal performance my only complaint was seeing a male character once again being gender switched thats not the first time this has happened it started with battlestar galactica and continued from there in other male projects some came and gone and others yet to be released thats not cool but i digress brie larson keep pn rocking lets hope captain america survives the next film
Mar 13 2019,positive,first marvel movie in a while that has enough querks about it to warrant multiple viewings thought it was a little slow in the first act but that was me processing an unfamiliar story 2nd and 3rd viewings werent stilted at all
Mar 13 2019,negative,disney continuing to ruin franchises pair that with an oscar winning actress giving you a performance so dry the sahara seemed wet and you have this mess
Mar 13 2019,positive,very good movie i liked it this movie is another puzzle to the mcu story
Mar 13 2019,positive,this is an origin story  great action and terrific story  i love the characters
Mar 13 2019,positive,that is how you do it  dfx atmos is a must see venue
Mar 13 2019,negative,cardboard characters stiff acting no onscreen chemistry forced quips for cheap laughs rewritten origin to fit overshadowing agenda the movie left much to be desired the only good thing was the stan lee cameo and the post credit scene where the viewer can be excited about a movie worth seeing avengers end game waiting for xmen to enter the mcu to have rogue shake hands with carol danvers and give the fans a character worth watching 
Mar 13 2019,positive,good but not great addition to the mcu canon with an antmanlike mix of action  comedy larson  jackson bring a playful energy to their roles and mendelsohn was on point eraappropriate pop songs were a little overdone
Mar 13 2019,negative,i like my superheros doing superhero stuff but some personality helps congratulations to thor darl world as it is no longer my least favorite marvel movie
Mar 13 2019,positive,loved the acting and the storyline although the end felt rushed
Mar 13 2019,negative,entertaining but forgettable after viewing i could have lived without the man bashing elements although admittedly funny on at least one occasion i like brie larson however her character was a bit arrogant and cold likely from directing not the acting fun great visuals worth renting
Mar 13 2019,negative,boring fell flat worst marvel movie to date   wasted my money by watching it in cinema shoulda waited till netflix or stan dont waste your money
Mar 13 2019,positive,my thoughts   awesome special effects  cgi no crappy rhino fight scenes   superb acting all around i especially liked the skroll characters   great although somewhat forced soundtrack   decent pacing compared to some other comic movies    unlike black panther which it has been linkened to because of the politics and butthurt surrounding it this movie is fantastic i didnt walk away wondering if i liked it  which had happened allot lately save for infinity war  put aside the politics and enjoy a great comic adaptation
Mar 13 2019,negative,bad writting nick fury is good best character is goose  everything else is boring and overglamourous cgi and oneliner that either work or not at all    and stan lee is stan lee for those who wondering
Mar 13 2019,positive,great fun movie   the backstory for carol danvers is told in flashbacks and the kree vs skrull war is explained  a little story to tide you ovee until endgame arrives  happy for the kids and action for the older kids only a couple of cuss words not sure why marveldisney allows the swearing in their family movies
Mar 13 2019,negative,this was a pretty ordinary movie  the plot and the story line are very boring at the beginning   all the regression she has through the movie are senseless pretty much like hotel artemis  samuel l jackson and the cat saved the movie if there is something left to be saved
Mar 13 2019,negative,worst marvel movie ever made what a waste
Mar 13 2019,negative,would be lower if not for fury not a fan of the actress who played marvel 
Mar 13 2019,positive,not bad just a little on the bland side
Mar 13 2019,negative,this movie is terrible worse than thor 2 and that is not saying much
Mar 13 2019,positive,great movie fun and entertaining
Mar 13 2019,negative,terrible the protagonist is just plain awful
Mar 13 2019,positive,omg seeing chewey renamed as goose on film plus captain marvel in all her glory whats not too love also hole garbage and no doubt were perfect choices for the soundtrack
Mar 13 2019,negative,spoliers on purposei only saw this film to figure out the point and make sure im ready to see the final avengers this movie could have been ten minutes long kid you not when i say there is an hour and a half of complete pointless boredom hats off the sam j and the cat for giving me some entertainment and a laugh captain marvel was a fighter jet pilot whom crashes trying to protect an alien disguised as a human the aliens trying to kill them show up at the crash an abduct her after she inherits her super powers by destroying the capsule that held it the aliens take her because has these powers and she forgets who she is only until later being abductee by other aliens to bring back her memory she then goes to earth and saves the aliens who helped her with her memory and at the same time defeats the other bad aliens now for the important stuff captain marvel knows how to use the powers in full force and helped creat the avengers in which she gives fury a pagerthis film was mostly set in the early 90sso he can contact her in case of an emergency while she is off protecting far off galaxies the endyes thats it not kiddingthats really itthe whole plot and ending it sucked bad and they chose the worst possible person to perform as captain marvel
Mar 13 2019,negative,this movie was so bland the real issue with this movie is the script theres just nothing special about it the twists they add in are just so bad its almost like they added them in just for the sake of it
Mar 13 2019,positive,i honestly have no clue what is going on in the minds of all you people giving it a low rating this movie has just the same high enjoyment as all the other marvel movies and while i canâtmt personally say anything about her being the first female lead in a marvel solo movie being a male but i agree itâtms pretty revolutionary all in all a better movie than the reviews say
Mar 13 2019,negative,man was that bad literally three different couples walked out at different times during movie super boring terrible acting i cant believe this was a marvel movie and now im not sure ill be able to watch the next avengers if shes the savior her acting was so stiff so bad almost like you could hear the director coaching her on each scene action ok now walk into this room with puzzled expression i love all the dc and marvel movies but this i would t even rent 
Mar 13 2019,negative,boring uninspired a real fumble right before endgame not the worst mcu film but close
Mar 13 2019,negative,dont waste your money to see this wait until it comes out on netflix redbox or on kodi for those so inclined bland stale acting from brie with little emotional connection to keep you interested when a cat is the best actor you know something is wrong with the movie
Mar 13 2019,positive,ok movie mainly just watched it for continuity purposes but liked a few things climax was solid 
Mar 13 2019,negative,the female equivalent of the green lantern the half star is for the only good thing in the movie the special effects total bust
Mar 13 2019,negative,medicore movie  main actress was robotic poor casting story was too fast paced didnt flow well
Mar 13 2019,negative,sadly they blew up a great marvel character the movie inst all bad but it has a tendency to be simplified and emotion less some escenes are way too cartoonish its in between thor 2 and green lantern
Mar 13 2019,negative,it does not have a rhythm it is lost among references the references to the 90s are poor and some wrong brie larson gives us a mary sue style character disappointing plot changes samuel l jackson steals the scene with goose the cat  but from the comedy wasted villans there is artificially reduced to others to make captain marvel shine the worst movie of the mcu
Mar 13 2019,positive,amazing dont listen to trolls took the kids ages 412 plus 3 adults we all loved it
Mar 13 2019,positive,loved it great origin story that fits nicely into the mcu 
Mar 13 2019,negative,ok so blaring logic  she is creating a faster than light drive with what ok she had to have a faster than light drive to get her secret invisible space station to earth  are we forgetting the tesserat was at the bottom of the sea with captain america so are we just going to toss out that time line  best part of the movie was the cat
Mar 13 2019,positive,great movie especially loved the after credit tease
Mar 13 2019,positive,my name is carol  really good addition to the marvel universe love the action and the 90s feel im all set up endgame now 
Mar 13 2019,positive,cant believe all the fragile egos out there  too much drama over a simple comment  the movie itself is pretty good   loved some things about it  disliked somethings   marvell was done in a weak way  jim stalin galactic magnum opus hero gets adapted into a 60 year old women  apart from that it was a very slick  smart production well written  great action scenes   i will see it again  it really is an amazing addition to an already brilliant marvel universe  the scope of these movies is just epic  well thought out like a chess game each movies is a single entity that fits beautifully into a bigger endgame 
Mar 13 2019,positive,easily worth the price of admission
Mar 13 2019,positive,captain marvel is a romp dont listen to the naysayers the action keeps moving the effects are superb and the 90s soundtrack is a series of guilty pleasures and there are countless nods to 90s culture throughout  is it a coincidence that veers blows arnold schwarzeneggers true lies cardboard head off in the section when the shapeshifting skrulls do their best imitation of t2000  could there have been more top gun iconography sure the film has its flaws   brie larsons portrayal is lively but to be honest i was expecting a little more depth from larson boden  fleck i kept getting distracted by samuel l jacksons skin so smooth for his 70yrs at some points i thought he was cgi the flerkin was probably over the top and laid the bathos on too thick its not gotg hell its not gotg2  but all in all it was a lot of fun and teases what will come in endgame
Mar 13 2019,negative,this probably could have been a decent movie if the writing wasnt so lazy the acting so poor and the story more focused  brie larsons acting is absolutely flat in this movie  i cant tell if she cant act or if this was what she was told to do but either way it didnt work  the relationship between marvel and fury is just weird she talks to him as a teacher to a child  like the last jedi the goal seems more to subvert audience expectations than to tell a good story and like the last jedi it is a terrible movie as a result  btw ive been trying for a week to get a review to stick but rt keeps removing
Mar 13 2019,negative,started off bad then was confusing and ended with its carol was a bad movie but was fun to make fun of the terrible lines in the movie
Mar 13 2019,positive,not sure what all the hoopla was about we saw this movie last night it was a good movie had a couple slow spots and was a little predictable but a good show
Mar 13 2019,negative,as far as marvel movies standards go it was pretty boring not much character development and a useless shallow moral
Mar 13 2019,positive,watch this movie for what it is a summer blockbuster with average acting and a mediocre storyline  i enjoyed it and the action but the character captain marvel felt rushed larson did great and so did jackson but i feel if they would have delayed it and added some better characters and a less predictable story it couldve been a home run
Mar 13 2019,negative,yawn same thing different characters from the marvel universe same as it ever was 
Mar 13 2019,negative,story was terribly put together and boring character is overpowered
Mar 13 2019,negative,sporadically entertaining it falls short with lackluster fight scenes fury and goose are great but they dont make up for the totally predictable storyline while the kree were portrayed somewhat accurately the skrulls being a downtrodden race suppressed by the white patriarchy of kree is just political fodder look throughout marvel history and you would see them as warmongering galactic conquerors who threatened earth with slavery and annihilation 
Mar 13 2019,positive,i loved the female representation in this movie i felt super empowered after watching this and i think this movie is a step in the right direction for the film industry
Mar 13 2019,positive,if you grew up in the 1990s this has a huge nostalgia factor it isnt mcus best but its a solid popcorn flick the visuals are great  its fast paced  and its a blast from start to finish stan lees legacy will last forever
Mar 13 2019,positive,excellent story line with great effects and an appropriate dose of marvel humor a few cheesy oneliners but overall it was a terrific addition to the mcu 
Mar 13 2019,negative,wonder woman was better theater was half empty when i watched it
Mar 13 2019,negative,clearly miscast captain marvel and relegating sam jackson as a side character comic relief was a huge mistake when are we going to see nick fury in action
Mar 13 2019,positive,overall excellent i had my doubts but she did an amazing job good script and directing was stellar 
Mar 13 2019,positive,another great movie from mcu 
Mar 13 2019,negative,as a generic marvel movie fan who is not well versed in the comic lore of the marvel universe i thought this movie was ok at best
Mar 13 2019,positive,this film was much better than i expected it to be im not a huge superhero movie fan but ive seen them all because i raised a son who is we both enjoyed the film and agreed that its a solid b picture the movie has a sense of humor and some of the special effects are very cool the acting is excellent including the supporting cast the story has a few holes but thats pretty typical of superhero movies anyway you really have to suspend  your sense of disbelief when you go to see any of them i have to confess that i was more excited than i expected to watch the spaceship chases when i realized that the pilots were women i didnt think it would be such an affecting moment but it was
Mar 13 2019,negative,look you can keep removing peoples reviews if you want  im not some crazy antifeminist i just didnt like the movie mostly because of its plot and script not being good
Mar 13 2019,positive,as far as disnyfied comic book movies go it was up there sad so many trump trolls attacked this movie trying to show support
Mar 13 2019,positive,i loved it i went not knowing what to expect because of all the trolly reviews but i was into it from the firts minute brie larson was great as was the whole cast
Mar 13 2019,positive,great movie sublte and powerful statements great for anyone who misses the 90s as well
Mar 13 2019,positive,saw it last night  it was a fun enjoyable movie  brie larson imbued a friendly amicable persona throughout the movie
Mar 13 2019,negative,by far the worse marvel movie yet
Mar 13 2019,positive,more or less i can see the great potential in this character moving forward in the mcu while not a perfect movie theres just something wholesome about captain marvel i see this character developing very well in future films and tha cat is adorable
Mar 13 2019,negative,the movie is visiually dull the story telling is nearly offensively formulaic the fight sequences are mostly lackluster larsons performance lacks the charisma and grandeur a character the importance of captain marvel must possess overall there is little to write home about other than the fact that this plot is a forceful absurd intrusion on the decadelong build up of the mcu collective story
Mar 13 2019,positive,this movie kicked ass brie larson kicked ass as soon as it was over i wanted to watch it again
Mar 13 2019,positive,solid marvel movie  not my favorite but still a lot of fun and well placed within the mcu
Mar 13 2019,positive,went in with low expectations because of all the drama surrounding it but honestly really liked it
Mar 13 2019,positive,hit all the feels for your typical super hero movie so i was happy at the end  there was a feeling something was missing from the typical marvel movie magical spell that just gave me a sense of disconnection throughout the movie  im not sure if its because i just didnt feel a connection with brie larsons captain marvel or what was it on purpose that she lacked that much emotion since she didnt know who she was  maybe but she did start to grow on me near the end when she began to find herself again  the music and its placement in the movie was spot on
Mar 13 2019,positive,one of my favorite marvel films by far
Mar 13 2019,negative,poor movie    the movie had okay fight scenes and had most of its strength early but deteriorated as it progressed    it ended up contradicting a lot of the mcu and the fight scenes were just okay it suffered from marvel humour as  well    the effects were also just okay the ones in space arent better than guardians of galaxy nor infinity war
Mar 13 2019,negative,opening was so confusing  my gf a major fan of the genre fell asleep and we both walked out
Mar 13 2019,positive,a great superhero movie great chemistry between brie larson and samuel l jackson fun to see the start of this new chapter of the mcu
Mar 13 2019,positive,the movie was not as exciting as i thought it will be  is like they played it safe with the story villain actress fights etc  the potential to have been an epic movie was there but failed miserably  perhaps all of marvels creativity is set on the coming avengers movie which the first turned out to be one of the best movies ive seen in a while
Mar 13 2019,positive,fun flick captain marvel lives up to the marvel standards captain marvel herself has a fun snarky personality great chemistry between brie and samuel l jackson good plot vfx and character development this movie has a fun charm to it watch it
Mar 13 2019,neutral,we 3 adults 2 children saw captain marvel 7pm thursday night for the first time  then 1015am friday for the second time 2 adults 2 children and sunday at 1015am 3 adults 2 children for the third time  we all have seen infinity war at least 10 or more times in the theater plus another 10 or more times at our homes after buying the bluray  this movie captain marvel is nowhere near as good as infinity war nor black panther to just name two recent ones  three generations watching this together and the only ones who loved it were the 4 and 6 year olds  the idea that captain marvel is paving new ground is absurd  read the comic books watch the marvel series of movies and tell me there are no strong female characters or superheroes  wonder woman must be a figment of my antique imagination  this movie was sooo disappointing  i went in with no expectations just wanting to be entertained  soooo disappointing im looking at the stack of blurays in my house  going back to buckaroo banzai  we have too many to list here  suffice it to say captain marvel wont be joining the scarlett witch wasp black widow etc etc etc
Mar 13 2019,positive,it was a good movie i dont know why everyone was freaking out i dont care about political crap or agendas and i didnt catch her interview i like superheroes and this looked cool her acting was fine she had an awkward moment or two but nothing major was it the best stand alone marvel film no but it was still a fun little flick and it closed the loop with infinity war got ne excited for end game 
Mar 13 2019,negative,mcu is really going downhill i wish theyd start putting more effort into these stories and direction watching each one recently always is the same boring narrative the scroll use was all out of whack the rhetoric was offensive pass get it together
Mar 13 2019,positive,really enjoyed the movie i was told lots of negative things about it and so i wasnt expecting much but in my opinion it was a great movie full of action and comedy the only thing i would say is it felt a bit rushed at the beginning
Mar 13 2019,negative,its sad because this movie could have been better the story is not that bad they just focus it badly though
Mar 13 2019,negative,the movie was boring the action scenes were not good and they went against the comics and continuity in the mcu this one aint it black widow to the rescue
Mar 13 2019,negative,i rate this movie one point five smollets  it really was a two smollets movie but the main captain character is too smug and obnoxious to really be enjoyable
Mar 13 2019,positive,i loved this movie it was fun and enjoyable from start to finish great characters great acting and great script
Mar 13 2019,positive,not marvels best work certainly not black panther but still a very nice movie 
Mar 13 2019,positive,i just watched the movie and loved it so much its a fantastic movie with lost of laughter action and so many game changers at first i wasnt sure about the movie because i havent watched a lot of marvel movies non of the avangers xman or older marvel movies just the new movies like spiderman guardians of the galaxy and the avangers invinity war but i still got almost all of the references im always in awe at how seamlessly the movies continue without lossing the older fans while stil getting new once after all captain marvel is a strong heroic and flawed human that overcomes the demonic and toxic people around her great superhero movie definitly going to buy it
Mar 13 2019,positive,amazing movie great action funny jokes and super good plot brie larson is also amazing in her role of captain marvel so bad that this movie had so many haters even before it was released 
Mar 13 2019,negative,not nearly as good as some say it is but its not as bad either
Mar 13 2019,negative,i was hoping this would be an awesome movie but sadly i was disappointed good things about this movie are the skrulls and nick fury bri larson also does a good job with what she is given however that leads into the main problem of the movie sheâtms hardly given anything other than likable character traits i never once felt like i knew her as character this is mainly do to the sloppy script of this movie since everything we know about her is told in flashbacks and even then they are brief clips of her past nothing is ever fleshed out we never get to feel her struggle with anything or overcome obstacles we only observe it happening in brief scenes her relationship with certain which are supposed to be some of the strongest moments in the film feel like the weakest since we never witness what her relationship is with them only weâtmre told what it is even then we have no idea who these other people are as characters either this movie has a terrible time explaining itself when it comes to who the main character is but also the world building it begins with her being some type of soldier for a race known as kree even then we no nothing about this world we know nothing about her teammates we know nothing about the politics of her world other than skrulls are bad and we need to kill them the lightning is terrible there are multiple shots where i had a difficult time telling what was happening and well as the cinematography with is flat and dull ironically the cinematography of this movie could be compared to that of a 90âtms sitcom one nit pick i have is the over abundance of 90âtms references every now and then it can be funny and cute but the film for some reason needs to constantly remind me that it takes place in the 90âtms overall i came out of this movie disappointed because i felt as if there was so much potential for an awesome superhero movie like nothing weâtmve ever seen before from marvel but instead i got a rushed out heartless movie that only exists so it can explain why a character shows up in avengers endgame if you want a popcorn movie with no substance other a few fun high jinx go see it if not spend your money on something else
Mar 13 2019,positive,the best mcu movie iâtmve ever seen âïâïâï thanks to brir larson for such an incredibly job i loved it  iâtmm now in love eith my captain marvel tmtmª
Mar 13 2019,positive,really good movie stop the hating just because its a girl role
Mar 13 2019,positive,loved it another marvel gem that entertains way better than the critically acclaimed movies look forward to seeing it again and seeing how capt marvel and thanos interact 
Mar 13 2019,negative,im a major marvel fan and 20mins into this movie i was somewhat ready to leave brie larson is a great actor but i dont think she portrayed the character right her acting was very bland and emotionless storyline was easy to follow but patchy at times overall im glad i saw it to keep up with the storyline 
Mar 13 2019,neutral,i went to see it knowing that many people said that it was awful but i dont agree completely   the movie is slow at some moments but the action scenes compesate those moments sometimes the dialogue is kind of cheesy and most jokes pretty unfunny but overall the movie is ok and not worst than the usual movies marvel makes every year     at least its better than venom
Mar 13 2019,positive,it was ok itâtms a great movie the story line is creative but predictable i liked it because it was the first marvel movie with a female lead and it gave a bit of insight for end game
Mar 13 2019,neutral,captain marvel features a loving stan lee intro incredible visual effects and some charming side performances but suffers from underdeveloped characters snail pace pacing and passionless direction making what could have been an entertaining powerful film a forgettable entry in the marvel universe
Mar 13 2019,negative,this was one of the worst movies marvel has ever made the acting is mediocre at best and brie larson is far too serious to be part of marvel which makes relatively funny movies it had way too much cgi fight sequences which were just repetitive after a while not only that although captain marvel is strong she is not that strong pretty much any superhero in marvel would have trouble beating a whole spaceship or a bunch of highly trained warriors aliens it is not faithful to the original storyline of the comics
Mar 13 2019,negative,the film was boring and had nothing new or intresting to it
Mar 13 2019,negative,captain marvel simply wasnâtmt interesting or entertainingheavily considered asking for a refundthe only marveldisney movie worse than this one is thor the dark world and thatâtms not saying much
Mar 13 2019,positive,funny and action packed serious when need be great soundtrack
Mar 13 2019,positive,in top three of marvel movies for me i thank the marvel gods that they didnt just repeat the epic flashiness of black panther and ragnarok and made this movie its own the actors were convincing and the constant questioning as to whatâtms real and whatâtms not helped peek interest even in the less beautifully action packed moments ive also notices a gross lack of comment in mainstream media on how beautifully artistic some parts of the movie are i suppose people are more worried about the politics and the franchise than they care about the art
Mar 13 2019,positive,awesomeness as good as any of the marvel movies 
Mar 13 2019,positive,great movie larson does a fabulous job of showing captain marvel as a complex character even while character arc is typical for a superhero movie the twists of the movie were well played and the history of nick fury and other characters was great to see    the only real flaw was that this movie should have been released in the 1990s its taken this long to start getting female super hero stories    my teenage daughter is now a convert to the marvel universe and is now excited to see avengers end game
Mar 13 2019,positive,great family movie
Mar 13 2019,negative,it pains me that rottentomatoes is forcing me to even rate this movie half a star because of truly how atrocious this film was at no point in the duration of this movie did i have the slightest clue of what was going in terms of the storyline because it was all over the place additionally this movies attempt in humor was disastrous and quite frankly embarrassing the plot was extremely predictable and the actionpacked scenes were dull and snoozeinducing brie larson may have been hot enough to lull me into this pathetic attempt of a movie but i will not fall for her ruse any longer 
Mar 13 2019,neutral,very unlikable they really focused on making it an icon for women that they made the film worst for all and the way she suddenly went from not being able to use full power because of the device on her neck to learning to fully utilising her power in like 5 minutes and blowing up an army and flying into space
Mar 13 2019,negative,larson is miscast  the story is ok but she detracts from it
Mar 13 2019,negative,it was bland and was kinda overhyped  the interesting part was the end credit scene
Mar 13 2019,positive,loved it  a great superhero film  goose the cat is going to be a superstar
Mar 13 2019,positive,incredibly entertaining and just the perfect amount of top gun nostalgia
Mar 13 2019,neutral,this was not an epic film as advertised it was mediocre and reminded me of the second antman movie it kept me entertained and i knew i had to watch it for the next avengers there were a lot of missed opportunities and too much was wasted on trying to prove the lead character was a strong female superhero that didnt need to be proved it was a given the main character felt phony and didnt seem like a strong woman superhero but more of a wannabe guy superhero maybe it was just her acting which was less than believable overall i think this will drop to the middle or bottom of the marvel stack of films for me im sad that this was the introduction to a character that the future of this franchise is so heavily invested in maybe she finds her place amongst the avengers
Mar 13 2019,negative,very underwhelming expected more from a marvel movie character development was below par the story was not engaging enough the relationships between the characters was not very believable the problem was not necessarily the feminist message of the movie but the fact that it seemed to provide nothing else but this feminist messageâgive us more
Mar 13 2019,negative,two thumbs way the heck down
Mar 13 2019,negative,when the namesake of the movie isnt even the best character its not a good movie it could have had an awesome story been empowering for women and had appeal to both genders by simply having a good story that added to the universe that has long since been established but i dont see how it did any of those
Mar 13 2019,negative,there is no comment for how disappointed i am 
Mar 13 2019,negative,this is the worst comic movie by far  there is not a single thing in this movie that makes it worth seeing  do not waste your time and money on this one
Mar 13 2019,positive,timeline issues aside the movie had slow pacing until the third act and the acting by everyone other than samuel l jackson jude law and the actor who plays korag all felt very forced and uncomfortable the plot twist didnt feel fresh when we have already had that knowledge from other films within the mcu cgi and third act of the movie were great but borrowed to many elements from star wars especially the soundtrack of the 3rd act so it felt like a different better movie timeline does not match up with events that happen in captain america the first avenger and the first iron man movie coulson also had only 3 scenes which is disappointing overall i would rate this movie 17th out of the 21 movies in the mcu
Mar 13 2019,positive,masterpiece some of you are just hating bc its a movie with a female lead role guys and a few girls we live in 2019 what the hell is going on
Mar 13 2019,positive,honestly a good origin story doesnt top black panther but that is kinda a bridge too far civil war and not as funny as ragnarok but a good effort nonetheless  good to see a different side of fury and coulson though i expected a little more from larson  great showing from benning mendelsohn and lynch    also jude law has guns    cant stop trolls but i can vote with my money
Mar 13 2019,positive,could work on character development you donâtmt really get to know captain marvel besides the things they flat out tell you cat was greatcould work on cgi but if you take in to the account the deaging itâtms fine the movie is entertaining but seems more like a step stone i do want to see more of captain marvel the character has potential but it would need some improvement
Mar 13 2019,negative,disjointed mildly amusing at best
Mar 13 2019,positive,very enjoyable movie good origin story and well acted
Mar 13 2019,negative,this movie was absolutely  horrendous i cannot believe the deleted reviews the only good performance was nick fury and coulson very dissapointed
Mar 13 2019,negative,the first half of this movie is really hard to follow   gets better in the middle finishes ok  mostly about showing off great special effects at the cost of the story line  the whole thing seemed like it was made to introduce another character to the avengers storyline as if there arent enough already  didnt love it
Mar 13 2019,positive,far better than the angry trolls making things up would have you believe
Mar 13 2019,positive,i thought brie larson did a great job as captain marvel her personality shines through the character and gave the right about wit and spunk that made the character shine the storyline was great and i enjoyed her back story leading up to who she became i wouldve liked some more fight or action scenes but i am probably used to infinity war and all the combat all in all great movie 
Mar 13 2019,negative,movie is just terribly dull carol is never really developed as a character you see her switch between being experienced and inexperienced frequently with no real reasoning behind it the quips which marvel movies are so well known for constantly fall flat the only saving grace of the movie is samuel jackson and goose but theyre always shoved aside to show more of captain marvel the main villain being revealed isnt a good twist because you never get the feeling you can trust them this movie just has no real saving grace
Mar 13 2019,positive,great movie very fun looking forward to a sequel
Mar 13 2019,negative,really nothing to write about boring was this really an mcu film
Mar 13 2019,negative,first half off the movie was boring and predictable the ending was not bad nothing compared to the other marvel movies though
Mar 13 2019,positive,absolutely loved it brie kicked ass
Mar 13 2019,negative,movie was below average even for a marvel film deeply  disappointed
Mar 13 2019,positive,i thought it was pretty good
Mar 13 2019,negative,prbly the worst mcu movie so far and im a huge fan wonder woman was a waaaay better female led comic movie pretty much made not ck fury a comedic side kick this one ranks somewhere above ff4 reboot and below ed norton hulk
Mar 13 2019,negative,not as bad as people say but its nothing special ill never watch it again but its not that bad
Mar 13 2019,negative,dry story one of the worst super hero movies that ive ever seen very disappointed 
Mar 13 2019,negative,sadly i cannot give zero stars
Mar 13 2019,positive,while its action scenes are mostly a bit bland the rest of this film manages to check all the boxes and be entertaining and complex the heroes and villains are all multifaceted there are some great moments of visual ingenuity and it fits perfectly into the mcu style without completely fading into the background it is more than a message film not relying on its context to elevate it but instead providing an entertaining fun film everyone can enjoy and some people can relate to
Mar 13 2019,negative,not the best superhero movie iâtmve seen  brie larson was terrible in it
Mar 13 2019,positive,was an awesome movie i loved the storyline and how they  built up her character
Mar 13 2019,positive,one of the greatest mcu movies
Mar 13 2019,positive,really good movie they family loved it
Mar 13 2019,positive,super fun definitely worth a watch
Mar 13 2019,positive,brie larson is a welcome and a formidable addition to the mcu  although the story was not as strong as i would have hoped the acting was strong and the way the story wove into other mcu stories was seamless
Mar 13 2019,negative,i am deeply offended as a big time mcu fan where does this even go cgi cant save this
Mar 13 2019,positive,pretty solid addition to the mcu  lots of plot hooks for future movies also  the scene with stan lee was so touching
Mar 13 2019,positive,a very enjoyable film with the politics and agendas surrounding this movie i went in with tempered expectations and left the cinema entertained
Mar 13 2019,negative,timeline doesnt line up with the rest of the mcu  hard to follow with all the time jumps in movie  humor felt forced
Mar 13 2019,negative,i came looking for an action movie of superheroes ended up lectured like a child of slow development simply awful
Mar 13 2019,positive,this may be the best mcu movie yet
Mar 13 2019,positive,solid enjoyed it first action movie ive seen in a while where i thought wow slow down but the pace was fun and my kids loved it
Mar 13 2019,positive,would definitely watch it again the end was crazy
Mar 13 2019,positive,excellent incredible loved from start to finish
Mar 13 2019,positive,the marvel cinematic universe goes 2121 they play with the conventional origin story and it works great instead of simply going from point abc etc a welcome addition to the marvel universe
Mar 13 2019,positive,what a fantastic super hero movie with a leading female hero to boot a must see
Mar 13 2019,negative,created an account just to state my opinions on the film although not a terrible movie it is watchable that being said the movie was very lackluster and quite honestly boring for the most part the action scenes were sloppy and not very exciting the story was alright but nothing new the politics behind this movie made it a very unpleasant watch and quite honestly i regret wasting my 10 on this film its funny that i purchased my ticket and the cashier told me she would not recommend another told me that it is not as good as the other marvel films but itâtms nice because itâtms the first female led marve movie from that moment i knew it was not going to be great and the focus on the cat was quite honestly tacky wonder woman was great alita was great this movie was not dont waste your money
Mar 13 2019,negative,boring movie bad acting no charisma marvel b movie
Mar 13 2019,negative,the pacing was a bit off for me at some points i liked everyoneâtms character and personality except for the main characterâtms captain marvel she didnâtmt have enough layers or depth for me but i loved her powers and when she went binary that was the cool part for me
Mar 13 2019,negative,this was not as good as i was hoping felt it never really went anywhereif captain marvel is the savior that the avengers needim afraid theyre screwed
Mar 13 2019,negative,it was a fun movie all in all but the action scenes were hard to watch with the camera blurring across the room as often as anything happened carol doesnt have much of a personality beyond sarcastic and witty the story with the skrulls was a welcome surprise if you can get a cheap ticket to see the movie its worth it
Mar 13 2019,positive,marvel nails it again fun action packed and at times funny brie larson rocks in the traditionally male role of captain marvel the most powerful hero in the marvel universe our local theater is running it in 3 auditoriums an all three are packed on the weekend so im not alone in my happiness with the film
Mar 13 2019,negative,its sad how this film failed to deliver in so many ways the protagonist had a weak character arc unlike the other mcu characters that came before her  not to mention her overwhelming powers that just left her totally unrelatable  uninteresting but whats really unsettling is for marvel studios to put the spotlight on her in defeating thanos in avengers end game  something which she never deserved this could be the end of the mcu for die hard marvel fans
Mar 13 2019,positive,this movie was awesome  would see it again 
Mar 13 2019,positive,lots of fun and zips along a a nice pace  sets up endgame nicely and i look forward to seeing more of captain marvel in phase 4
Mar 13 2019,negative,funny ive reviewed a lot of movies on this site but never had so many problems getting a review posted they had 3 errors two confirmation and logged me out twice before letting me get to this screen this movie wasnt very good the lead had nothign at stake and didnt seem to care about what was going on if she didnt care and had no sense of urgency so i found myself not really caring what happened int he movie either
Mar 13 2019,positive,i dont often go to movies more than once while theyre in theater but im goin back to see this one again its a good time
Mar 13 2019,neutral,compare to other stuff marvel making this is average
Mar 13 2019,neutral,boring with a messy plot
Mar 13 2019,positive,good but not great theres plenty of room for improvement
Mar 13 2019,positive,great moviesaw it twice and will see it again
Mar 13 2019,positive,this was a very average marvel film i did enjoy many aspects of captain marvel but it my biggest problem with it is the lack of personality and arch of that the character of carol danvers has there is also one very dumb part of this film that changes how see a very important character in the mcu
Mar 13 2019,neutral,basically a meh movie with a lot of needless pandering and jousting at windmills i think some man was condescending to wonder woman like once in the whole movie in captain marvel it had to be five or six times very tiresome additional to a bland movie would not recommend
Mar 13 2019,positive,great movie cant wait to go see it again
Mar 13 2019,neutral,to be honest i expected more then this although the acting was great the story was meh 
Mar 13 2019,negative,below average  very disappointing
Mar 13 2019,negative,middle of the road movie
Mar 13 2019,negative,boring awful typical
Mar 13 2019,negative,a huge disappointment considering this carries the name of the comics and studio should be marvels best superhero film but falls vastly short bad choreography bland lines and copy paste plots
Mar 13 2019,positive,good movie brie larson i love you
Mar 13 2019,positive,delightfully fun  ties in with the rest of the mcu seamlessly lots of cool easter eggs if you pay attention  brie was great  cant wait to see her in endgame
Mar 13 2019,positive,brie larson was a great casting choice the storytelling was captivating and the special effects were as breathtakingly awesome as youd expect the audience score being lower than the critic score for an action movie suggests the rumors are true nutjob white dudes scared of feminism downvoted this movie before it even hit theaters sad
Mar 13 2019,negative,honestly one of the worse mcu movies so far a big step back in the quality
Mar 13 2019,positive,excellent movie  even went out of my way to see it in a dolby cinema and was not disappointed  the quality of this film inline with thor raganarock and guardians of the galaxy  stan lee tribute made me tear up  go see it
Mar 13 2019,negative,i was disappoint with the film  seemed low budget and poor writing  jokes were not very funny and fights scenes seemed very amateur
Mar 13 2019,positive,im not sure what some people dont like about this film but whatever it is i most certainly wasnt bothered by it what so ever maybe it was because i love watching movies where the stakes are lower than most marvel films and where the interest lays less on the how are they going to win the fight question and more on the whos behind the curtain question i dont know i just really loved this movie and i refuse to be convinced otherwise
Mar 13 2019,positive,was it perfect no was it fun absolutely to all the haters hey theres no accounting for taste lets face it look at how messed up our government is however the over 160mil domestic and 340 overseas is a huge vindication for the studio now lets bring  on endgame
Mar 13 2019,positive,not a bad movie overall but far from great      though i have not followed the original marvel captain marvel comics not shazam post marvel vs dc lawsuits my understanding is that the origin story for marvels captain marvel changed quite a bit to accommodate this movieorigin story  this by itself is fine it happens all the time with these reboots of super hero movies however my biggest complaint of the movie is that it felt like it was shoehorned into the avengers line of movies rather than being something to stand on its own  it felt more like a hey here is a movie that you need to see because its part of avengers end game rather than here is this new movie we made with this new character that you might enjoy  maybe im being too knit picky but that is how it felt to me    brie larson did a fine job though not what i would describe as great  i do wish that the story would have progressed in a more linear fashion rather than doing the amnesia thing i think it could have flowed better while still relaying the same story  overall this isnt a movie i would tell people they have to see but rather something they should watch if they are bored and want to see a decent scifisuper hero flick
Mar 13 2019,positive,right wing trolls trying to sink this film   it was great  mustsee
Mar 13 2019,negative,its fine sorta funny at times  if youre not a comic book fan its might even qualify as good  if you are a comic fan its a bland lazy rehash with terrible retconning helmed by a character that has nothing to overcome and zero weaknesses  you cant invest much when it is impossible for the title character to be in real danger  its not much different than superman showing up at the end of jla it has no value because there are no stakes captain marvel is simply a boring character played by a great actress who phones her performance a more charismatic casting choice could have improved the film or you know just making giving a solo film to one of the already established wonderful mcu female heroes save your money shell be in endgame anyway
Mar 13 2019,negative,cringe and lazy made
Mar 13 2019,positive,people sometimes are way to critical the move is good could it be better sure most movies can improve they filled in holes and showed why slj is a great actor
Mar 13 2019,positive,from the opening bars of the marvel theme song when you hear it you just know youre going to see something great to the final postcredit scene it was one entertaining ride i am amazed at how marvel is able to consistently put out high quality entertainment well done once again
Mar 13 2019,positive,its interesting that the app limits my review to only 4 and 12 stars definitely a 5 star movie  best marvel film yet 
Mar 13 2019,positive,fun and great visuals great story i will see again in 3d next time
Mar 13 2019,neutral,its captain mehvel i want to say i went to this movie with an open mind but i could not believe this is a mcu movie     to start i like the 90s setting sam l jackson as nick fury ben mendelsohn as talos the skrull and goose the cat     i found this movie boring on all fronts the script is bad jokes fall flat brie larson is stone cold it feels like a bad 90s superhero movie i would call this the worst mcu movie     this movie can hurt the mcu it made captain marvel so powerful that everyone before is useless i hope that there is some type of damage control to save it but here hoping it has also left a  bad taste which could affect endgame     i would not suggest going to this movie wait till it comes out on a streaming service
Mar 13 2019,positive,captain marvel is a fabulous addition to the marvel universe  sheâtms a strong and likable character  we also see young nick fury and the cat is the best the story perfectly sets up end game and it will  be interesting to see how she fits in with the team  itâtms a little slower moving than some of the more recent marvel universe movies pacing is more like the first captain america will see a second time  iâtmm disgusted by the people who bad mouth this movie simply because it has a female lead get over yourselves losers no wonder you donâtmt have a girlfriend
Mar 13 2019,positive,this movie was a blast and the raw power behind larsen was a sight to see the real strength of the movie comes from the supporting cast especially lashana lynch who had me truly believing the friendship between carol and maria the film is fun and campy and wellpaced
Mar 13 2019,positive,this movie actually turned out to be pretty good going in i thought it was going to be a repeat of thor the dark world but it ended up being more like iron man 3 my only real complaint is that the dialogue felt a bit forced at times but those instances were distant enough to go unnoticed most of the time overall itâtms a solid movie and itâtms made me even more hyped for avengers endgame
Mar 13 2019,positive,overall decent movie not horrible but not a masterpiece by any means  some of the 90s stuff is cringe no doubt song playing when it did the nirvana song being there at all because kurt cobain wouldve never wanted that if he were alive today       some of bries lines feel odd and her character in the movie has no growth arc  the subtlebutnumerous feminist messages and nods throughout the movie either dont make any sense or play off poorly and some of the retcons make absolutely zero sense  carols powers dont have any intricacy to them and she just seems allpowerful because she just is which is kinda boring  there is no villain in the movie who actually poses a challenge to her so it makes the fights weightless      id say the real stars here were samuel jackson and lashana lynch with honorary credits to goose the cat and ben mendelshon as talos  it really felt more like their movie with carol danvers acting as a plot device and not much else      still though its a decent watch  not something youll want to see multiple times but you can do worst with 1020 at a theater on a weekend
Mar 13 2019,negative,the humor was corny the story was boring almost fell asleep during the movie only upside of the movie was the cute cat
Mar 13 2019,positive,this was a really good movie  anyone who is so sensitive to women being represented that they automatically hate it should be ignored
Mar 13 2019,positive,this is a great movie brie larson is perfect in it best marvel movie yet
Mar 13 2019,positive,i absolutly loved the film best 2019 film so far
Mar 13 2019,positive,not the best movie marvel has put out but it was still a blast from start to finish
Mar 13 2019,negative,such a let down for a marvel film too much political propaganda
Mar 13 2019,positive,this movie was fun and felt shorter than 2 hours  the moment where carol stands up to the person who held her back and refused to play by their rules felt 1000 times more satisfying than anything she destroyed with her superpower thanks marvel for this great metaphor of standing up to the gatekeepers of fandom  i dont think everyone understood that scene but i will most defiantly be seeing this film again with my mom who always wanted to be spiderman but was told she couldnt because she was a girl
Mar 13 2019,neutral,thorougly dissapointing as a mcu fan carol danvers is badly written its not even larsons fault danvers has a character line not an arc she found out who she is and thats it no character flaws fears or weaknesses like superman without kryptonite on that note once she reaches her full powers its like when superman shows up in the justice league the movie is basically over she breezes through any and all opposition and adversity i wish it was a better movie
Mar 13 2019,positive,funny with a strong protagonist great message for kids boys and girls excelent effects cast everything a must watch movie for this generation
Mar 13 2019,positive,i enjoyed watching this movie even with the couple of plot twists that came with it
Mar 13 2019,neutral,this movie is all over the place brie larsons performance is inconsistent and carol danvers is unfortunately one of the least interesting characters in her own movie i feel like we never really got to know carol and we had to told what she was like instead of seeing it for ourselves thats a major problem this movie tells instead of shows were told carol has trouble controlling her emotions but we never see that were told by other characters that carol is a good person but we never see these traits ourselves the first act is bad boring visually uninteresting full of exposition poor characterization setting up stuff that never gets a payoff thankfully the movie gets better once carol arrives on earth at least until the kree show up again during the climax there is very little character development here nothing is fleshed out enough and certain moments dont feel like they were earned the action is unmemorable carol is so powerful that she outclasses everyone else and its just not interesting to watch the movie feels like its being told out of order and it comes off as confusing there are two different stories here the kree stuff and the earth stuff as a result the movie feels crammed and unfinished its a mess there is good stuff in the movie but the audience will know the twists long before the characters do and its not fun waiting for them to catch up this movie is ultimately middle of the road but weve come to expect better from marvel this is no wonder woman and while there is potential none of it is utilized as much as it should be
Mar 13 2019,negative,flat uninspiring a lot of hype for an average film
Mar 13 2019,negative,i went into this film with good faith but was terribly let down as a lover of the mcu i ignored all the drama on either side but couldnâtmt get over the fact that brie larson was just very boring as captain marvel maybe they will find a way to fix this character but this wasnâtmt it
Mar 13 2019,positive,great cast and soundtrack looking forward to seeing captain marvel again
Mar 13 2019,negative,uninteresting in plot and characters it wasnt even funny to make up for it i never once felt invested in or afraid for the characters    this was the worst marvel movie in a long time    i know some people love or hate it based solely upon the fact that brie larson leads but i care about plots and characters not the sex of the main character
Mar 13 2019,positive,lacking a main villain but a great show of power by the main character of captain marvel
Mar 13 2019,negative,why does a mcu movie have to have a feminist agenda all comic book     why did the mcu have to have an feminist agenda in this movie brie larson lost me with her portrayal of this capt marvel and i love women super heroes    nerds love their women super heroes
Mar 13 2019,neutral,the beginning had me tapping the seat out of boredom but the movie eventually got on its feet it was fun if something not super unique when compared to other marvel origin stories
Mar 13 2019,positive,loved it great origins story and looking forward to seeing capitan marvel in endgame
Mar 13 2019,positive,loved the movie  great performances by all involved great sound design and visuals  loved the characters and how it ties in with the rest of the marvel universe
Mar 13 2019,positive,easily one of marvel studios best origin stories carol danvers has been my favorite marvel character for 30 years and this film did not disappoint i love the new take on her supercomplicated origin and thought brie larson absolutely smashed it canï 12tmt wait to see what endgame has in store for carol and hope that she has a sequel announced soon
Mar 13 2019,positive,awesome dont believe the fools talking bad about this film
Mar 13 2019,positive,a great mcu addition i look forward to seeing more of this characters contribution in the future
Mar 13 2019,negative,this film is simply put dry it was poorly written and a waste of a talented actress brie larson there is no arch for the character no tension and no clear resolution for the film lesswell shes out there somewhere also retcons made to previously established lore have now lessoned other characters in the mcu if not the entirety of the avengers in a sorry attempt to give captain marvel some skin in this decade plus long saga adding awkward callbacks to the 90s underutilized support characters and unnecessary injections of forced agenda politics the film simply doesnt deliver stilli was able to stay awake
Mar 13 2019,positive,great movie brought me to tears near the end
Mar 13 2019,positive,great action sequences and original storytelling
Mar 13 2019,negative,all the criticism over excess feminism was a bit overblown  the main problem with the movie was that brie larson is not really suited for a superhero roll  she lacks the fundamental charisma that is needed in a superhero lead  her timing seemed off on her one liners and just didnt have that presence of a great superhero  with characters in the mcu like scarlet witch you can feel her pain in her acting and motives with captain marvel its just kind of bland and without passion
Mar 13 2019,negative,movie was ok did not care for the  director or the main  character fight scenes not  rememberable my advice is wait till it comes out on dvd
Mar 13 2019,neutral,its about on par with the first captain america in terms of entertainment value brie larson was emotionless uninteresting and didnt fulfill the role well slj was great as always as were the other actors the plot was meh the writing was meh and the directing was middle of the road all in all not marvelous save your  and wait to rent it
Mar 13 2019,positive,as a conservative i can say that this movie was absolutely amazing all the crazy drama going around is completely unfounded i get that these days itâtms kind of hard to tell whatâtms meant to be a political jab and whatâtms meant in good will just to be an awesome story this falls into the awesome story category remember guys just because sheâtms a girl hero doesnâtmt mean itâtms politcal or sjw also not all diversity decisions are bad remember fury was originally white but now we get samual l jackson and i couldnâtmt imagine someone else nailing the role like he does definitely a must watch before avengers end gametm     bri larson nails the role and marvel made another incredible movie thatâtms up there with the best³
Mar 13 2019,negative,the plot is weak bad acting in general and is not even comparable to other marvel movies
Mar 13 2019,neutral,not great  not terrible  probably one of the weaker mcu movies  but still okay
Mar 13 2019,negative,the action is topnotch stuff as you would expect from a marvel movie and the story whilst poor in the first half has a decent twist in the second half    where this movie falls apart is with the main character captain marvel as a character is so dull she has no defining personality traits pretty weak motives and i just couldnt bring myself to care about her at all    im no critic but it seemed like a combination of no effort to develop the character in the writing and some very bland stoic acting from the lead    overall it wasnt a complete waste of time but i would say its a wait for it to appear on netflix kind of title
Mar 13 2019,positive,the real beginning starts a bit late but after that you are hooked with some funny moments
Mar 13 2019,neutral,itâtms an okay movie not great not terrible just okay itâtms shot okay itâtms directed okay itâtms acted okay itâtms written okay everything about it just okay i wouldnâtmt recommend paying full night time prices for it go see it as a matinee or wait for it to come out on netflix
Mar 13 2019,positive,rather slow start then nonstop fun after the initial scene setting was done loved every second from that point on terrific performances great soundtrack hilarious script another job well done from the marvel franchise
Mar 13 2019,negative,didnt care for it probably my least favorite marvel movie
Mar 13 2019,positive,what a greatsolid origin story went back to marvels roots of a slow start but then laid one hit after another on clues for upcoming and past films a must see
Mar 13 2019,negative,it is hard to compare but it falls short of the woman woman movie and even black panther i felt it was trying to hard trying to fit a round hole into a square peg
Mar 13 2019,negative,boring very boring
Mar 13 2019,neutral,very disappointing disney and marvel dropped the ball on this one felt like i was watch a tv movie of the week no effort from the studio
Mar 13 2019,negative,boring script forced humor larson could be a good drama actress but humor is not for her and forced feminism just see what happened to marvell nick fury lost all his badassness skrullsreally  after all the only good  thing about the movie was the cat
Mar 13 2019,negative,i think this is the worst marvel movie
Mar 13 2019,negative,this movie is a good film all in all and can be pretty enjoyable the politics that are surrounding this film are a pain i personally watch movies to enjoy a different worldplace and see what creative minds have to offer not for some political agenda whether its on my side or not i watch movies for the movie and i wish that was the case for this this movie has a ton of potential but was drenched in some pretty nasty stuff the movie itself however is very enjoyable and if you like marvel do watch this film i found it to actually be pretty funny and was laughing a good amount captain marvel brie larson doesnt seem to show much emotion nor can she un clinch her fists she is a strong character but not one i feel like i can relate too although she is a human from earth i feel as though i am more connected to the other avengers who are from other worlds all in all it is a good movie but not a must see
Mar 13 2019,negative,movie was bellow average and keeps ok only because itâtms heavily depend on already established marvel universe
Mar 13 2019,positive,great movie overall not my favorite marvel movie but its up there brie larson kicks ass and has great chemistry with samuel jackson also im a cat dad so i was of course entranced by goose the best character in the mcu definitely recommend
Mar 13 2019,positive,the movie is good but not wonderful i felt the film very forced to present to captain marvel in the marvel cinematographic universe the scenes sometimes feel the cgi and the villains very wasted maybe because we have seen very good marvel movies and these low performance
Mar 13 2019,negative,extremely dry storyline captain marvel has zero personality and brie larson just kind of ruined the character for me by trying to force her politics in a superhero movie who does that the only reason this movie is worth seeing is the action scene towards the end is pretty cool and the end credit scene for avengers endgame
Mar 13 2019,positive,excited for the next one
Mar 13 2019,neutral,painfully average in every possible way with the most unlikeable mcu main character at least it has a lot of nick fury in it
Mar 13 2019,negative,good popcorn movie i liked it
Mar 13 2019,neutral,this movie is fun to watch but it adds little to the universe and trades drama and mystery for humour and cosmic rainbows
Mar 13 2019,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed it not the best of marvels many offerings but certainly not the worst either fit right in with most of the recent marvel films
Mar 13 2019,positive,wish it would spend more time showing not telling but still really enjoyable brie larson is very likeable in this role
Mar 13 2019,positive,incredible my favorite marvel movie
Mar 13 2019,positive,great cgi on slj and great set up to avengers endgame brie plays the part well and it sets up future heroes go see it 
Mar 13 2019,negative,i worked for marvel as a toy designer back in the day i have read thousands of marvel comics for nearly 35 years i wanted to love this film but it was hyper political flat emotionless and forgettable its also obvious rotten tomatoes is purging negative reviews so i no longer trust this platform i have yet to meet a single human in person who like this film 
Mar 13 2019,positive,loved it goose is soooo cute
Mar 13 2019,neutral,this film was something i really wanted to love going into seeing it but ultimately for me it fell short  when you go to see any film but super hero films specifically you meet the character and see their flaws and insecurities  throughout the film you go on a journey with them and by the end you can sit and say yeah i really understand who this person is and the motives for everything theyre doing  this film didnt do that for me  thinking about it i really feel that it was the way the whole thing was presented  the content itself didnt really bother me it was more the way in which the story was organized  i feel that having her begin captain marvel at the beginning and flashing back to her life before which she doesnt necessarily remember really took away from the character depth  aside from some major issues that i had with the films organization brie larson posed some issues for me as well  although shes a fantastic actress deserving of all the accolades that shes received from a comedy standpoint i just dont think she does as well  personally i just feel that shes not great at delivering punchlines so for me all of the normal campy stuff that works in marvel films fell really flat for me this time around  the final thing that i think really bothered me with the film was the lack of challenge for the character even before she had her full powers  this was honestly the first marvel film i walked out of thinking i probably didnt need to see this nor would i pay to see it again  all that being said i do think it did a nice job setting up for end game but thats all the movie really feels like a fillerset up for something way bigger
Mar 13 2019,positive,one of my favorite marvel movies to date ms larson plays a kick ass heroine who tells it like it is she is sarcastic kind and extremely relatable she is who many people should strive to be more like her character carol is now my favorite superhero and hopefully will be many others this is a must see
Mar 13 2019,positive,i thought the movie was fun  it had a few twists and i think brie larson did a good job  i thought it was every bit as good as wonder woman  i think the expectations for this movie were very high which may be why some didnt like it that much  i tend to agree with the overall rating of the critics on this one
Mar 13 2019,negative,this film sets itself apart from all other movies in the franchise in a sense that for the first time i left the theater feeling let down and a bit cheated as an audience member there are lots of plot holes that didnâtmt make sense that they never explain and there are no real obstacle for the films protagonist to overcome once she gains her full power she is basically invincible there is never a sense of urgency or danger because the protagonist is so powerful their is no conflict the special effects and space scenes which i was really excited for were completely dismal and seemed to be recycled from previous films
Mar 13 2019,neutral,captain marvel was an entertaining addition to the mcu however although fun at certain points it never got me to fully invest in or be inspired by the main character carol with that there were various things that were inconsistent with the continuity in the mcu particularly stemming from various things said leading up to and within the first avengers film now i understand that the mcu is massive and can be confusing all in one bite however its not to the point where ignorance of continuity is excusable especially from one of their most popular installments aside from that however the movie itself fails to find a pace or style that really captivates you and stand out from the rest also as talented as some of these actorsactresses are none of them do an outstanding job at their role which is disappointing because some of these individuals have very good track records particularly brie larson who never really seemed to lockin the captain marvel character well probably due to direction mishaps but i digress    overall as much fun as this movie can be its not traditional mcu quality and i feel that it did more of a disservice to the universe more than anything however i am excited to see this character in endgame and the stan lee cameo was incredible so it at least gets a passing grade but i will certainly not be paying to see it again
Mar 13 2019,positive,i loved this movie so many things were carefully orchestrated fun and thoughtful and i cant wait for end game
Mar 13 2019,negative,larson has all the screen presence of a door knob and to call the krill refugees takes creative license to a new level total stinker so save your money and just guess why private marvel is in end game
Mar 13 2019,negative,there was a lot of hype surrounding this movie so i went to see it in the theater i thought it was better than aquaman batman vs superman justice league and suicide girls but not as entertaining as most mcu movie or wonder woman marvel and fury had good energy but the production shortcutsbudget was telling throughout the movie theres a lot of telling vs showing an ok popcorn movie but if theres ever a sequel ill wait for the netflix release
Mar 13 2019,negative,captain marvel is not likable or funny  origin story is uninspired  villains are weak or just completely absent
Mar 13 2019,positive,fresh and powerful great addition to the contemporary movieâtms scenario
Mar 13 2019,negative,after spending twenty minutes having no idea what was going on i left no character building no story buildingjust ott action like a poor early 90s action flick i thought this was supposed to be a film for women dont they know we like that stuff i had no idea who the blue people or the green people weredid i have homework to do before watching in which case i did not get the memo boring
Mar 13 2019,positive,wonderful woman this film is the different from any other marvel movie from the first act where we enter into this extremely cool special ops field carol danvers is the most believable that weâtmve seen her as she trains with her teacher jude law carol danvers crash lands on planet 52 earth where she runs into nick fury played by samuel l jackson from there  we see a joining of a really cool buddyâtms cop flick nick fury and brie larson are joined together in defeating the skrulls or so we thought it turns out there is  a plot twist and as carol danvers discovers her true identity she recognizes that she has been lied to the entire time ok so the cast is phenomenal outside of the few awkward lines that are given to brie larson every scene is breathtaking and fresh you can not go wrong with a younger nick fury and of course the cat is wonderfully adorable this film overall good movie
Mar 13 2019,negative,dont waste your time on this film poorly directed so many questions and character development has none whats up with all the posing in just about every scene
Mar 13 2019,positive,entertained the entire time  loved it   brie larson nailed it
Mar 13 2019,positive,solid marvel movie thats entertaining 
Mar 13 2019,negative,marvel fell off with this one i say in the movie and wanted to go to sleep
Mar 13 2019,positive,thoroughly enjoyed it and my kids loved it they enjoyed the new addition to the mcu and i enjoyed the 90âtms soundtrack lol
Mar 13 2019,positive,captain marvel was hardly a groundbreaking movie wonder woman was recently a huge success for a female superhero movie but it was fun nonetheless brie larson and samuel l jackson put on great performances which we have come to expect the movie also answered many questions from the mcu franchise although many of them were trivial it also sets up infinity war endgame nicely despite the goods however there were still many problems with the movie captain marvel was very inconsistent tonally it almost felt like marvel wanted to make a guardiansesque lighthearted movie then remembered brie larson is an oscarwinning actress and wrote in emotional scenes for her to act the movie would also make little sense to anyone who is not already familiar with the mcu but again whos watching this movie without any knowledge of the mcu bottom line is if you are an mcu fan youre going to see this movie and you will probably have fun watching it
Mar 13 2019,negative,really not that good suffers from a boring plot and a miscast actress although she might be great in other roles marvelâs first real dud how anyone can give this movie 4 or 5 stars is beyond me 
Mar 13 2019,negative,what do you expect if you have all necessary ingredients but terrible at cookingsame thing with this movie i blame on the directionscreen play and actors are like reading scripts
Mar 13 2019,positive,really solid marvel movie would recommend seeing in theaters i had a lot of fun watching this  the onscreen chemistry of brie larson and samuel l jackson is great
Mar 13 2019,negative,cannot recommend this movie
Mar 13 2019,positive,this movie was outstanding as a marvel fan and comic book nerd i was thoroughly impressed by this adaptation im a white male and at no time did i feel marginalized threatened or offended by this film     would i see this again yes yes and yes
Mar 13 2019,negative,was excited to see it but disappointed when i did was overall a lackluster movie larson didnt give the character much of anything i wanted to like it but just couldnt not sure why it is doing so well with all the reviews stating how bad it was my guess is people are going to see it just to get a glimpse of avengers  end game sneak other than that the movie was not worth it glad i didnt pay full price for it
Mar 13 2019,positive,great marvel movie it added to the marvel universe and set up for the next movie
Mar 13 2019,negative,nah man i didnt like it at all it wasnt as good as other mcu movies
Mar 13 2019,positive,captain marvel may be predictable and formulaic to those familiar with how mcu films are plotted but it is still a thrilling funny and visually stunning superhero film where brie larson successfully portrays the essence strength and charm of the title character
Mar 13 2019,negative,no plot terrible acting characters were boring and the feel was more like guardians of the galaxy at times but without the humor it was terrible on a good note i did like the cat and sam jackson
Mar 13 2019,positive,very enjoyable overall though seems to be trying to pack too many things into it at some points
Mar 13 2019,positive,captain marvel has an original origin story for sure the action is great and same for the cast i liked the character of carol and the fact she doesnt give up while being emotionaly weak sometimes the skrulls are great so is the cat and nick fury i wish we had learn more about carol her friends etc theres also a few problems of pacing but overall i think the good far outweights the bad by the way the last 30 minutes and the first post credit scene are absolute fire and the humour was on point for me
Mar 13 2019,positive,it wasnt my favorite mcu film but still pretty enjoyable the storyline was great and had good themes of identity and perseverance however i feel the dialogue could have been better written there were lots of moments where it felt flat a little bit of a missed opportunity considering the unique plot and acting power in this movie overall worth watching but does not live up to iron man black panther gotg
Mar 13 2019,negative,the movie had a very strong opening a lot of interesting characters on an interesting planet it was all downhill from there the plot had very little to do with captain marvel herself overall she felt like a supporting role in a plotless movie instead of having to overcome a weakness or discover a secret about her past she simply wills herself to become stronger and harness her powers literally all that she had to do was think oh i can do this and she did what took her so long
Mar 13 2019,positive,captain marvel was an average movie the movie started off very weak but later became more enjoyable samuel l jackson and brie larsons chemistry was very good through out the movie my only problem with the movie was the the fact that we had this big buildup to a huge fight and itâtms just a few minutes and the beginning was very weak the best part of the movie is that itâtms different than all of the other marvel hero origins    i am looking at this movie as if there were no politics involved
Mar 13 2019,negative,es un asco esta mejor wonder woman
Mar 13 2019,negative,the visual effects are great as always specially with young fury the rest of the movie its just bad the story is too simple the lead acctress has no real personallity and the support characters are there just to remind you how cool she is
Mar 13 2019,negative,cons  âmovie couldnâtmt find its tone  âmovie had poor song choices for action scenes  âmain actress felt blend and didnâtmt leave an impact like other mcu characters did i basically can see anyone else play captain marvel  âlazy writing from the writers      pros  ânick fury and talos did an amazing job and definitely made the movie more likable   âaction scenes were good not perfect but good  âthe aliens and the environment was really well made
Mar 13 2019,positive,maybe the best in a long line of great marvel movies
Mar 13 2019,positive,nice movie tho simple story
Mar 13 2019,positive,really surprisingly good i went into this fully expecting it to be boring and cliche based on the trailers but this movie was honestly good i liked it dare i say loved it yes theres a female lead no they dont shove it down your throat that shes a female superhero the fact that she is female affects the plot in several subtle ways but overall its a story and shes a character that could be relatable or inspiring to anyone  its not perfect and in my opinion wonder woman was a better femaleled superhero film but if youre saying that this movie is trash then 90 of the mcu films are also trash its a perfectly good movie better than most character introduction marvel films if you actually go and see it i think youll be pleasantly surprised
Mar 13 2019,positive,captain marvel is not the best mcu movies but is definitely one of the best the comedy part of it is on point and the action scenes are great and well done brie could portray carol danvers wonderfully with this i must say that i cant wait to see her destroy thanos
Mar 13 2019,negative,the plot was ordinary the special effects nothing much and the acting left a lot to be desired i hope captain marvel doesnt play a big part in future movies i like most marvel films but this one sucked
Mar 13 2019,negative,cinematically garbage drab and boring   if you want a funny review that sort of culminates this entire fiasco cbc interviewed this critic who said we should support female representation in film so he wants to give a good review but the movie is so bad he cant basically everyone right now
Mar 13 2019,positive,great film with a nice twist and a lot of power
Mar 13 2019,positive,i came into the movie skeptical because of the politics and youtube drama but i really liked the film of course it is not ironman or winter soldier level but it is a good first film for the character i think it is sad though that the movie has received unwarranted criticism because sjw and manbaby wars i look forward to a sequel
Mar 13 2019,negative,boring bad and the most unlikeable lead actor in recent memory your lying if you liked it
Mar 13 2019,positive,the movie is a fun and enjoyable ride i loved the supporting cast such as samuel l jackson  jude law etc in terms of brie larson as captain marvel carol danvers i thought she was pretty good for the most part and that i believe overtime throughout the mcu her character will evolve into a much more likable character the movie does suffer with some pacing issues and it is all over the place this movie feels more like a phase 1 marvel movie and i think that was the main problem people just arent used to having movies like that anymore not only that but i personally believe that the timing for this movie isnt the greatest this movie is sandwhiched between two of the most anticipated comic book films avengers infinity war and avengers endgame i think she should have been introduced prior to these movies it would have had less weight to be carried on the movies shoulders overall i believe that this movie is a fun ride not the best marvel film by far however it is definitely not the worst marvel has put out i am excited to the future for this franchise and i believe that if time is given to brie larson and her performance she will be a much more loved character throughout the mcu
Mar 13 2019,positive,captain marvel is a fun and exciting ride with pretty visuals and excellent performances and despite its flaws managed to be a pretty good movie warning for all who havent seen it minor spoilers ahead anything spoilery will be marked   one of this films biggest strengths was the talent in front of the screen the amount of star studded actors giving this film their all is really what made it as good as it is samuel l jackson reprising his role as nick fury as he makes it very clear in the film everyone just calls him fury despite being called nick several times by maria hill in previous films is excellent as always jude law brings his talent to the table although what less could be expected of him and of course ben mendelsohn brings that villainous charm that weve come to expect from him brie larson whom i had very low expectations of after seeing the trailers as well as one of her previous movies actually pleasantly surprised me bringing life to the character clark gregg reprises his role as fan favorite phil coulson good as usual and of course lashana lynch provides one of the most charismatic characters to the film in marie rambeau out of no where  as usual marvel spares no expense on the visual effects topping each and every spectacle in the film with an even bigger spectacle in the next scene at times you dont even notice the cgi as it blends so well into the background most notably the deaging cgi theyve used on fury and coulson works so well that eventually you dont even notice its there it just looks that natural  the story is while not horrible its not fantastic either it reuses one of the biggest cliches in hollywood which i cant speak for everyone but it defintely took me out of the film little continuity errors were scattered without such as what i mentioned earlier about fury and maria hill that were rather frustrating but not enough to seriously detract from the experience the major twist of the film is actually rather large almost as surprising as the plot twist in spiderman homecoming but heres the thing while it was surprising it didnt have that shock value that stuck with me i didnt walk out of the film still contemplating what id just seen like i had with previous marvel movies that had major plot twists in them like guardians of the galaxy 2 and spiderman homecoming im not saying i wasnt surprised im saying that it just didnt seem like a big deal after the fact   another issue i have with the film was the cinematography and choreagraphy most marvel films have a certain style to them when it comes to the directing its not always easy to pin down i probably couldnt explain them to you if i tried but they are undoubtedly there and for some reason this movie just didnt seem to have any specific style as a matter of fact the cinematography actually was nearly absent making the movie feel very basic thats not to say it didnt have its moments the scene early on when the skrulls are looking through her memories is very well done and one of my favorites in the movie but for the most part it was just disappointing in the same way most of the fight scenes in the movie were very poor primarily the climax it was so dark in the room where they were fighting and again the cinematography made it very difficult to see what was happening again thats not to say it didnt have its moments the scene at the beginning when carol is trying to escape the skrull ship with the cuffs on her hands is particularly fun but for the most part it is very disappointing  despite all this it managed to maintain to hold my attention throughout and to have a comprehensible plot that flowed quite nicely while i wouldnt give it a top spot amongst the big contenders of the mcu i do think its earned its place as one of the better films in the now 21 film franchise
Mar 13 2019,positive,goose the cat flerken awesome
Mar 13 2019,positive,good origin story but why has it took her so long to show up where the heck has she been for all these other big battles like new york and the rest fury didnt think she would be needed when an alien ambush came to new york through a worm hole hmm only questions 
Mar 13 2019,negative,worst marvel movie ever worse then the original hulk
Mar 13 2019,positive,captain marvel was an ok entry in the mcu brie larson wasnt given the best script she could have cinematography was poor at points but an overall fun time
Mar 13 2019,positive,i believe this was a marvellous movie for many reasons associated with identifying the origin of captain marvel in an amusing and inspiring fashion followed by giving the audience something to look forward to seeing within the future of the cinematic universe
Mar 13 2019,positive,captain marvel is a good movie  not great but good  where it stumbles is in the lack story development to the overall mcu arch we know how this one is going to begin and we know how it endswhich is how its presented to the audience it also suffers from the movie faux pas of undercutting its own characters eg nick fury and ronan the accuser in order to accomodate newer more meaningful characters but at the expense of things previously established  where the movie does well is in the actors  brie larson is good samuel ljackson is very good and lashana lynch is incredible  so there you have it its on the lower end of marvel movies but id still watch this over several of the other offerings out there in movie land
Mar 13 2019,positive,was a great movie enjoyed the sound track i personally liked the fight scenes and had a really good plot im really looking forward to seeing captain marvel in future movies and enjoyed learning the origins of marvel my favorite part of the whole movie though was the witty humor from captain marvel made me laugh
Mar 13 2019,neutral,it had its moments but ultimately left us slightly disappointed worth seeing if you are invested into the marvel films but it is one of the weaker films i was unaware of captain marvel before they started making the movie so i had no preconceived notions of what it should be they did a decent job of developing the character and it was played pretty well however for some reason it just didnâtmt work great not one of the movies i will watch more than once
Mar 13 2019,positive,captain marvel was a brilliant excellent movie the cast is perfectly fit their role the movie put such a great plot and the mid credit scene is a fantastic scene where they bring more hype to us in another big game overall is 8710 for me
Mar 13 2019,positive,best stan lee cameo
Mar 13 2019,positive,really enjoyed it the flaws are very minimal overall its wellmade and the cast is great brie larson is amazing as captain marvel and i love her chemistry with slj love goose
Mar 13 2019,positive,decent movie but didnt like some of the character changes from the comics
Mar 13 2019,negative,very poor film acting was just sad was expecting more from this
Mar 13 2019,negative,bland story no real character devolopment
Mar 13 2019,positive,excellent move great character back story and development exciting action scenes looking forward to this new addition to the avengers
Mar 13 2019,negative,the supporting cast carried this movie brie larson as captain marvel was not very relatable in my opinion but it might have to do with dealing with a very boring scripti wouldnâtmt see this again
Mar 13 2019,negative,this movie is boring
Mar 13 2019,positive,really enjoyed the movie while its definitely not my favorite marvel film i think they did a great job of introducing carol danvers to the mcu presenting a fun and actionpacked take on the traditional origin story and bringing in the skrulls in a unique way that i surely wasnt expecting i think brie larson did great though the script and story often didnt give her enough space to stand on her own as the lead and i think ben mendelssohn was just unbelievably good as talos it also sets the groundwork for more premcu storytelling thatll allow for some epic space battles and exploration
Mar 13 2019,negative,flat plot do no expect a good storyline
Mar 13 2019,positive,it was another great marvel movie if you were a teenager during the 90s the music will bring back memories the flash back scenes worked well in telling her back story i enjoyed it all and though it was funny as well certified fresh
Mar 13 2019,positive,robert downey jr fits into iron mans suit like it was made for him i cant say the same about brie larson as captain marvel some of the humor and acting didnt feel right but there was enough humor that did land  along with great acting twists and a climactic ending  that made the movie great
Mar 13 2019,negative,i found brie larsons acting bland i had problems with continuity issues and although the post credit scenes hinted at endgame i could have passed and still been ok when endgame comes out this is a waituntildvd movie for me i did not like this movie at all compared to the other marvel movies
Mar 13 2019,positive,its actually pretty funny
Mar 13 2019,positive,enter the cinema smiling from start to finish i love everything about this movie one of my favorite marvel movies i love the soundtrack and original score the fight scenes also love brie and samuel and also the plot twist in the story  would definitely watch this again in the cinema
Mar 13 2019,positive,this was a great movie perfect balance of funny and serious well written acted and directed kid friendly and its super nice to see a strong female lead 
Mar 13 2019,negative,lead actor doesnt have any endearing qualities in the film
Mar 13 2019,negative,wife fell asleep about halfway and i couldnt wait for it to be over felt we needed to see it before endgame my wife said captain america she had never heard of captain marvel before was bland and the beginning was too confusing  i agree
Mar 13 2019,positive,i wouldnt say i am a super fan or obsessed with comics like some other people i know but i do believe i would know more then most i was super stoked see captain marvel i enjoyed the extra clip in avengers and the trailer there was a huge controversy around this movie over the last few weeks about a statment that was made and divided the fanbase i didnt care i love the mcu and needed to see this movie this movie in my opinion isnt that great the first part of the movie is great but i caught bad cgi which seems to be a disney thing black panther but i shurged it off people have mentioned before this movie was even an idea that brie larson was very emotionless and stonefaced i never understood until now i found brie larsons acting really subpar i want to see a super hero she wasnt one slj was ok really nothing ground breaking same old slj lossing his eye was more of a bad joke than a cool story the music in the movie was great i didnt think some of it worked at certain times but it was still good i didnt really enjoy the nostalgia forced into the movie but it wasnt a killer cgi in this movie was bad the cat was bad the mask and helemt were bad the skrulls meh weak rohan weak thought he would of been a bigger role coulson saddly pretty weak 1st act great 2nd act boring 3rd act boring 4th act good at no point in this movie was i blown away maybe because its an origin story but i asked myself what was my favorite part stan lees cameo i rate this 35 i dont think its a terrible movie but it is just not that great
Mar 13 2019,negative,awful film dont waste your money
Mar 13 2019,positive,awesome movie itâtms better than the average marvel movie
Mar 13 2019,positive,an average origin story movie with a touch of mass effect vibe captain marvel herself is not that interesting but the side characters and villains are making up for it it doesnt really feel like a marvel movie if you blend out nick fury his young self looks pretty good though and he makes up for some good comedy moments its a decent popcorn movie but with very little momerable moments and rewatch value might add its not necessary to watch as a set up for avengers endgame
Mar 13 2019,positive,captain marvel was a genuine superhero action movie thorough but rough choreography a bit cliche storyline but overall actionpacked and humorous but the only problem is because its a marvel movie people had their expectations high up the mcu had set their bars so sky high from their previous movies that captain marvel could not live up to it it was hard or even almost impossible for another solo movie especially a prequel to satisfy the viewers what could have been it was mandatory for marvel to have this slight downfall to create a massive influence on infinity war endgame in conclusion decent movie but unavoidably underwhelming
Mar 13 2019,positive,great origins story  ignore the antifemale fan boy haters
Mar 13 2019,negative,i went into this movie with an open mind only to be presented a bland story with very little to no character development the main character had absolutely no emotion no real character development force feed comedic moments that occur at all the wrong times
Mar 13 2019,neutral,typical mcu film but with mediocre dialogue narrative and direction expository dialogue is overwhelming from the beginning starting with yonroggs conversation with captain marvel on the kree subway dialogue can be painful at times such as agent coulsons theyre heading into a tunnel five seconds before we actually see them head into a tunnel or marias explanation its the only thing that was left of the crash as carol is holding her old burnt dog tags leave out the line focus on the dogtags and cutthe audience will read between the lines    the tell dont show philosophy continues right to the emotional payoff of the movie wherein we get an information dump about all the times carol stood up after falling down rather than actually letting us experience those events with her i understand that origin stories tend to follow a specific formula and captain marvel attempted to put a spin on that but i actually would have preferred to have this characterization of our hero develop from the beginning rather than having it shoved into a montage at the climax of the film     plenty of middling superhero action but also plenty of glaring flaws that place it in the bottom half of my mcu rankings
Mar 13 2019,positive,flawed comedy style action scenes very predictible strong on secondary characters rather than lead overhyped hopefully something good will be done with her in endgame
Mar 13 2019,positive,loved this cant wait to see her throw down with thanks     i personally loved the momentomarvel mashup intro they did here they took some liberties from the comics but it just works  bravo guys cant wait to see aeg
Mar 13 2019,neutral,it was certainly full of action and special effects but not much else probably the  only marvel movie i wont be seeing again even once it is free on netflix
Mar 13 2019,positive,thoroughly enjoyable blends genres with ease and makes fun fantastic references to its era and wider comic universe another fantastic marvel entry providing one of the stronger solo character pieces
Mar 13 2019,positive,great movie people just get upset because marvel have been setting the bar too high through out the years with all those awesome movies you cant expect every movie is gonna be better than the last one
Mar 13 2019,positive,this as a really good movie it is getting a lot of undeserved hate but i guess thats what haters do i gave it four stars for begin a really good movie and one to counter the obvious and unwarranted hate campaign levied against it i liked it because there was cosmic and superhero action and a really unexpected twist i loved that i got to see more of marvel in space i loved seeing nick fury and coulson in their younger days i love the cat and the little girl i loved that fact that the main character was so cocky this movie fits in so well with avengers the end credit scenes there are two were pretty good too and the tribute to stan lee was heartwarming both the tribute and his cameo cant wait to see cm again in endgame 
Mar 13 2019,negative,dull characterization creates so many continuity errors in the mcu takes a tense moment and basis of the winter soldier and turns it into an absolute joke  carol has no depth of character isnt shown to care and be selfless  skrulls are relegated to being an allegory  bland fight directing and choreography
Mar 13 2019,negative,lackluster acting and fight scenes it was disrespectful to turn one of the most serious and respected people into a 5 year old at the sight of a cat
Mar 13 2019,positive,absolutely fantastic movie i loved it
Mar 13 2019,positive,not great not terrible somewhere in between story is a little confusing but still interesting great special effects funny in spots not one of the better marvel movies
Mar 13 2019,negative,poor script i personally didnt like de plot twist with the skrulls great acting performance by sam jackson besides fury is a joke character on this movie the way he lost his eye is disrespectful to marvel fans very good special effects
Mar 13 2019,positive,it was a great movie very solid movie even with those handful of inconsistencies 
Mar 13 2019,negative,simply a dud of a movie nothing amazing and just might be the worse mcu movie brie is forgettable and is boring to watch disappointed to say the least 
Mar 13 2019,negative,movie was not very exiting
Mar 13 2019,negative,i know 2019 hasnt been going for that long but this is by far the most underwhelming movie of this year it looked really promising at first though
Mar 13 2019,positive,the comedy saves the weak storyline the chemistry between brie larsen and samuel jackson and his cat works too
Mar 13 2019,negative,no depth in character doesnâtmt stick to canon totally destroys the epic mystery of how nick fury lost his eye
Mar 13 2019,positive,watch it for 2nd time love it better than the first viewing  in memory of stan lee cant wait to see how captain marvel to end the game endgame this april
Mar 13 2019,positive,very good movie  not marvels best but still very good
Mar 13 2019,negative,terrible lead performance and shallow plot
Mar 13 2019,positive,starts off slow but finishes off strong give goose a movie already
Mar 13 2019,negative,maybe this and iron man 2 are the worst marvel movie not too bad but it isnt too good
Mar 13 2019,positive,captain marvel not only delivers a fast paced action superhero film but it does a fantastic job adding an addition to the mcu world the story was so well written and did an excellence job at tying in characters and secrets while keeping the story consistent to future events that took place during the other films all in all captain marvel is a huge success and did a fantastic job at giving this superhero a standalone story while still getting fans even more excited for the next avengers film with the inclusion of carol danvers definitely one of the best marvel films
Mar 13 2019,positive,nick fury is awesome nick takes the spot light from captain marvel captain marvel doesnt have any good movements where she shines i personally think the movie is watchable and every mcu fans should see it others can wait for bluray
Mar 13 2019,positive,good movie not a great one i deducted points for storyline choices directorial choices and fight choreography choices overall the acting was great its biggest draw back is it is trying too hard sometimes less is more
Mar 13 2019,positive,its funny and thiss began the marvel universe
Mar 13 2019,negative,it was an all around below average movie for a marvel movie it clearly destroyed fury and made winter soldier an amazing movie look dumb this is also the first marvel movie i have only watched once bcz by the end of the movie all i was left saying was wtf was that the cgi was the only good thing about the movie and clark gregg coming back fury was also good except for the end brie larson although a great actress her humour felt forced and it was sarcastic all the time with no emotion she is no tony stark and i cannot see her leading the avengers i only wish she doesnt have much role in end game or even she does i hope they make her better than she was in this
Mar 13 2019,negative,spolier alert virtually no character development of the main character carol danvers and really lacked any emotional punch this movie should have been called âyoung nick furyâ because samuel jackson seemed like he was the main focus for much of the film    the relationship between carol danversvers and jude laws character whoâtms name i never caught was threadbare but you were expected to think she considered him her mentor and someone she respected who turns out to be the bad guy when it was finally revealed i didnâtmt care because she didnâtmt seem to care the character of mar vell also seemed to be someone she should have had an emotional reaction to the death of but the moment lacked any gravitas i think the directionwriting of the film is where this failed    the worst marvel movie iâtmve seen but still watchable just not memorable
Mar 13 2019,negative,horrific script writing and story line it wouldnt have mattered who played carol cringefest through and through
Mar 13 2019,positive,it was a great movie you can definitely tell that it was directed with the female audience in mind because a lot of the humor that comes from captain marvel is subtle and revolves around the sexism women face every day it might be more difficult for men to pick up on the nuances unless they are knowledgeable of the issues women deal with this may explain why some people think the first half of the movie is dry the second half of the movie contains more action and a hilarious nick fury i absolutely adored this film and i hope the guys out there who didnt like the movie understand that how they feel is exactly how a lot of women feel when they watch the dozens of superhero movies created with a male audience in mind just because it wasnt geared towards your tastes doesnt automatically make it bad
Mar 13 2019,positive,great movie very well done the deaging cgi wasnt creepy the story was solid and it tied in nicely with infinity warend game if folks hadnt lost their collective minds this would be high 90s but you know trolls  if youre a fan of the mcu this is a cant miss and youll be psyched you didnt
Mar 13 2019,positive,not the best marvel movie but still seems a critical story to be told in the mcu before end game
Mar 13 2019,positive,solid see if you like cats
Mar 13 2019,positive,honestly one of the best movies marvel has churned out in a long while i went in unsure of what to expect and had an amazing time it wassimple simply wonderful brie larson did a great job and i definitely had my doubts going in since she normally does drama and other genres not marvel action but she was great loved the story pacing special effects costumes stunts and most of the humor feel good movie that feels how super hero movies should 
Mar 13 2019,negative,it so funny movie it ready to avenger endgame
Mar 13 2019,negative,a very flat film and on a par with iron man 2 and thor 2     its extremely forgettable with no real memorable scene or action sequence     also for once in a marvel film the humour misses 90 of the time     not a great film at all disappointing after all the hype
Mar 13 2019,positive,slow start but one of the better developments and openers for a marvel character a lot of great messages as well 
Mar 13 2019,negative,it was just worse than any other marvel movie i was very angry and disappointed
Mar 13 2019,negative,in two words skip it    the best way to describe this movie is as a failure in filmmaking every aspect of it and everything it attempted all fall flat on their face    from a technical standpoint the editing is rushed and poorly paced especially in action scenes where theyâtmre nonsensically shot and cobbled together from angles that donâtmt match the flow of events from cause to effect is nonexistent    the effects look convincing enough but are also very dull and derivative in terms of design for both creatures powers and vehicles    the acting is flat across the board there is rarely a line that isnâtmt off unconvincing or downright wrong in its delivery and this applies to all actors in the film even actors who are great in other films    the worst part by far is the script though which is the latest in a long line of films i refer to as firstfinal drafts movies that feel like they started shooting on a first draft and thus feel unbaked    there are more plotholes than i can count some just nitpicks but most are huge inconsistencies and major illogical events which drive the plot forward    probably the biggest one is the unclear power levels of the different races and characters in the film which are inconsistent and change based on whatever the current scene requires this completely kills all stakes in the action where you canâtmt tell what your characters are capable of and what theyâtmre dealing with    the emotional and dramatic payoffs exist sporadically without proper buildup for them while many build ups that did exist though arenâtmt any good get abandoned after a weak climax iâtmm talking large chunks of development simply tossed aside for a good half of the film or even more  this applies to all arcs in the film every relationship every character arc including captain marvelâtms and the main plot itself    this script was not ready for the big screen not even close somebody needed to take the best ideas from the movie and refocus them expanding where itâtms needed and cutting everything that didnâtmt need to be there and most of all streamlining the events and arcs of the film so they make sense and arenâtmt a poorlypaced plothole riddled mess    in conclusion donâtmt see the movie donâtmt waste your money and time on it  if you care about the plot and the effect it has on the mcu as a whole just read the spoilers online though youâtmll probably be disappointed by that too
Mar 13 2019,negative,poor plot development many of the characters did not have depth to them the worst marvel movie iâtmve ever seen
Mar 13 2019,negative,so bland and predictable the only saving grace was how short the credits were
Mar 13 2019,neutral,i went to see this film in spite of the agenda marketing which was in my opinion very counter productive this film was probably the worst character intro film marvel has released since establishing the mcu but probably on par with thor 2 or iron man 23 its not terrible it is still better than most of the dceu films except wonder woman a film that did just about everything right my main issue is that the characters journey is a little weak she is a badass superhero rediscovering who she used to be which was a badass fighter pilot there isnt a lot of character growth for carol we dont really see her as anything other than awesome even in her previous life it really wasnt quite as exciting or compelling as other marvel character debuts i think much of that falls to the character she is overpowered like superman in some ways but without much of the charm overall an ok film that wasnt as bad as i expecting there were some agenda moments that felt a little forced and at least one major nick fury character moment that was turned into a bit of a joke which seemed like a waste but i didnt hate it 
Mar 13 2019,positive,i was so excited for this movie  a female superhero with superman like powers then actors got on their soap boxes spoiler alert ï 12 ronans entire group fleeing her awesomeness was overdone get real
Mar 13 2019,negative,first marvel film ive seen in a long time that didnt get me excited to watch again or care what happens next captain marvel felt like some of the studios earlier entries that werent bad but not up to the level fans have come to expect today the writing was really weak and as a viewer i always felt one step ahead of what was going to happen which was really disappointing and boring i loved brie larson in room but i guess she just showed up for the paycheck which is disappointing because shes proven herself to be more interesting than her bland portrayal here sam jackson was the highlight of this movie and the only one who kept me engaged until lashana lynch playing the only scene with a true emotional beat in the movie id rather of seen more with her character and that dynamic lastly the action was so mediocre bc it lacked any tension or stakes if it wasnt at least necessary to see captain marvel on the screen before endgame id say wait to stream this one
Mar 13 2019,positive,absolutely incredible 
Mar 13 2019,positive,this is a great movie dont believe the negative comments there is everything weve come to expect from a great marvel origins story and she is going to be an amazing addition to the universe
Mar 13 2019,positive,fun marvel film that brings something different to an origin story exactly what i expected however the ben mendelsohn acting was surprisingly below par maybe this was due to his makeup but overall great fun film brie larson was incredible as captain marvel jude law was good sam jackson was incredible and goose the cat offered great entertainment
Mar 13 2019,positive,completely entertaining her affect is one of such complely confidence that interaction with others are similar to a parent dealing with a very cute toddler accepting of bad behaviou but nonjudgmental
Mar 13 2019,negative,the movie was boring the story lame i really didnt like it waiting for endgame
Mar 13 2019,negative,strong female presence 
Mar 13 2019,positive,cool film can wait see her kick thanos ass at avengers endgame 
Mar 13 2019,negative,if this was the movie to introduce the caracther that will end up eventually replacing captain america i feel it was overhyped for such a boring premise
Mar 13 2019,positive,go see this movie i was expecting movie that was okay but still wanted to see it the movie was great we were so excited at the very end of the movie my whole family enjoyed it and i cant wait until end game comes out 
Mar 13 2019,positive,visuals are great the score is unique and not what youd typically find in a marvel film marvel needs to stick with these teamup movies it worked well with the winter soldier thor ragnarok and here
Mar 13 2019,negative,not good enough as a marvel movie
Mar 13 2019,neutral,it was meh not bad not great jokes fell flats no real character development and retconnning the mcu skrull invasion story ruined and stupid way for fury to lose an eye
Mar 13 2019,negative,terrible film and very worried this character will ruin end game
Mar 13 2019,negative,this movie was just rushed out there to go up against dcs ww i like marvel movies but this was botched
Mar 13 2019,negative,did not enjoy this film
Mar 13 2019,positive,it was good no comment 
Mar 13 2019,positive,i liked it it was an exciting movie good effects good soundtrack nice fight scenes good for kids too just a little swearing looking forward to the next one
Mar 13 2019,negative,it was twice as good as i thought it would be i expected all the characters to be as bad as brie was but honestly captain marvel was the only horrible character seeing as shes the main character that created an extremely large issue 
Mar 13 2019,positive,the script is ridiculous but the cast is great and the movie is made with love a must see for lovers of the 90s brie is stunning 
Mar 13 2019,negative,ok film best part were the female leads still surprises me that with all the high techwarriors are still bad shots
Mar 13 2019,neutral,not as good as the others
Mar 13 2019,positive,an enjoyable film despite its flaws
Mar 13 2019,positive,wow such an awesome funny and action packed movie i lovem it cant wait for the next one  
Mar 13 2019,negative,its just dumb makes no sense and the characters are off and dumb just a bad bad movie
Mar 13 2019,positive,personally really enjoyed this movie    many other reviews on here are reviewing the film based around other marvel films yet they fail to see this is like all other marvel movies its own standalone film  story    while its not the best marvel movie it still strongly deserves 5 stars due to the story visual effects soundtrack and the subtle tieins to the other films within the mcu    it gives a strong and positive message to females and im proud to be taking my daughter to go see it for the second time this week
Mar 13 2019,positive,in a world being violated abused and  ravished by men for their own greedy financial gain a movie such as this is a refreshing breath of fresh air in the current climate and state of our planet a hero such as this is just what i need also love the cat goose
Mar 13 2019,positive,excellent addition to the mcu a very good origin movie i loved brie larson as carol danvers as a long time comic reader i was particularly pleased with the twists to the story involving the kree  skrulls the story went differently to my anticipations i am really looking forward to captain marvel sequels based on the storylines left running at the end of the movie in sort if you like the mcu see this excellent film
Mar 13 2019,positive,i was turned off by the initial audience reviews but saw the movie anyway i am happy to say that it is a solid entry in the marvel franchise 
Mar 13 2019,positive,loved it perfect uplifting respite from the bleakness of infinity war totally pumped for endgame immediately made me want to go through the whole mcu canon again
Mar 13 2019,positive,as a stand alone film its not too bad the first 10 minutes or so are a bit of mess the middle has some good moments followed by a way over the top final act with unnecessary music more could have and should have been done to make this a more balanced film all the ingredients were there yes there was a certain element of over the top feminist tones and i hope that is pulled back in future im surprise that destinys child  survivor didnt get a song play but in terms of the future mcu lets not forget that thor 1 and 2 were pretty lame and arguably iron man 2 but those characters have still shone through over the general course of things thinking again a lot of the origin stories barring the odd one havent been amazing id say there is a decent foundation here to evolve the character to fit well into things providing marvel can take note
Mar 13 2019,negative,i was under the impression this movie would lead into avengers endgame there were good parts to this movie like the scroll and samuel l jackson i thought they tried to explain things about existing characters that were more interesting as mysteries i did find the main character a bit bland but didnt ruin the movie but it was disengaging in all fight scenes as there was never any doubt she would win no suspense this made all the fight scenes uninteresting to me marvel cgi was again on point
Mar 13 2019,negative,overthetop feminism  writers more interested in making a statement than a good movie  the female characters drip with girlpower themes  the male characters are generally evil or a bit submissive  even samuel jacksons nick fury is muted compared with other appearances  i have no problem with girlpower movies eg wonder woman but this forces viewpoints unnaturally into the script
Mar 13 2019,positive,feels like a transformer movie full of action and pretty people however in the end you just dont connect with the main character
Mar 13 2019,positive,one of the best marvel solo movies is it as good as gotg or iron man no but as a die hard fan this is a very good movie i laughed cried but most importantly felt for the characters ive read criticisms some say the character development was bad and others seem the work of trolls giving vague one lined opinions one said the found the movie decent but gave the movie a 1 star rating i thought the character development overall was well placedit was slow to begin with but it definitely makes up for it when it gets going the comedy was funny and well timed the vfx was stunning the story telling and action had my mouth visibly opened it was amazing if you are like me you love superhero movies but are off put by all the negative reviews imo its worth you money and time as it is another great addition into the mcu higherfurtherfaster
Mar 13 2019,neutral,acting wasnt too bad liked the casting script and effects felt weak either series fatigue or just really meh execution
Mar 13 2019,positive,went to see this movie as a huge fan of marvel movies but still didnt expect this one to be very good however i was extremely surprised definitely a must see i really enjoyed this film and i will definitely be seeing it again soon
Mar 13 2019,negative,disappointing to say the least bad acting bad effects bad ending characters were poorly developed and never instigated any emotional investment by far the worst marvel movie to date 
Mar 13 2019,positive,the movie was good as all marvel films are worth seing once even if i was a repeat viewer type i would only see this one once of all thr rotten tomato numbers i feel only the top critics is the most accurate all crtics and audience likes not so much some of the audience scores are tainted a tad by people that dislike brie larson for her statements and the all critics honestly also seems tainted with the opposite side of that drama that are saying the trolls just hait a female lead   i would put it slightly above thor dark world i did like one twist i didnâtmt see coming and i also want to rename my cat flerkin
Mar 13 2019,positive,excellent comedy and action movie with a superhero that common folk can relate to the story was full of meaning and i enjoyed almost every moment of it only criticism is that the lead actress could have been more diverse instead of the typical caucasian character
Mar 13 2019,positive,i went in worried due to the amount of backlash this film saw prior to release i neednt have worried its a marvel movie like any other
Mar 13 2019,negative,i was excited to watch the movie after the end credit scene of infinity war but im disappointed after watching this movie i hope that end game makes a recover from this 
Mar 13 2019,negative,weak plot contradictory to existing timeline no connection to any of newly added characters most importantly the protagonist cgi felt fake on many occasions except nick fury and some action sequences were not up to marvel standard we now come to expect i really hope she does not have a prominent role in next avengers movie
Mar 13 2019,negative,movie really didnâtmt make sense it was all over the place iâtmm all for woman empowerment but geesh did they really have to change marvell from a man to a woman that really pushed it for me  changing the villain to good ppl was way off  all the hint throwing made me feel weird using refuges as a way to say they just want a home and arenâtmt evil with the skrulls was to much monica that situation was a mess honestly getting offended cause someone called you young lady was far fetched if youâtmre trying to prove women empowerment men acknowledging you a one shouldnâtmt be a problem honestly what can men call women nowadays without âoffending â  the directors just did to much and not in a good way i also wish we wouldâtmve seen her grow into her powers she was already powerful so itâtms like we missed that connection to be like â oh my goodness did you see thatâ as soon as the movie started we got her being to powerful i didnâtmt like that nick fury was weak in this movie in the passed movies he was tough head strong it wouldâtmve been nice to see two head strong leadsmale and female i was omen of the feeble ppl really excited when i seen her symbol at the end of infinity war i was âcrunkâ but just to be shut down iâtmm hopes just like black panther
Mar 13 2019,positive,it was overall an enjoyable film  the plotstory was solid  acting was wonderful  effects were great  pretty much what you expect in a mcu movie      my one issue is that i felt overwhelmed and perhaps a bit isolated with the clear social agenda its delivery and its frequency  its perfectly fine to have that stuff in a film especially now and especially for this film  but i felt that it could have had just a few great enlighteninginspiring moments on the topic  instead i felt like they looked for every minuscule opportunity to and seized it  and went as far as to create opportunities to go even further where doing so felt forced    that was the only bit that didnt sit right with me  beyond that i was excited to see the film and it doesnt disappoint  its not my new favorite marvel movie  but its a welcome addition  i look forward to further development of the character in future films in the mcu
Mar 13 2019,positive,enjoyable movie good humor and action more ground work for avengers endgame saw it in dolby looked and sounded great 
Mar 13 2019,positive,awesome movie adds and completes a lot to the avengers story
Mar 13 2019,positive,good movie pacing was a little uneven and there were times when the cgi was a little too pronounced other than that it was a fairly solid origin story a bit slow at times but still provides some decent fight scenes the main problem lies in its lack of identity through direction and as a marvel film i dont want to discredit those involved because theyre doing their best but in terms of writing and directing there is much to be desired 
Mar 13 2019,neutral,i had no issue with brie larsons comments about white dudes this movie was just bland and predictable 
Mar 13 2019,positive,top 5 origins film from marvel imo
Mar 13 2019,positive,wow one of the best stand alone comic book movies enjoyed every second of it definitely the perfect filler movie before endgame 
Mar 13 2019,neutral,standard marvel fare few funny moments a decent action scene or two but it never really takes off it seems to know what components make a good marvel movie but not why they make it good or how to utilize them also you never really get any sense of carol danvers as a character the characters have to tell us that she acts rashly and is impulsive but we never see it and she never has to overcome that in any way other than remembering her past her character doesnt really change at all from beginning to end i could also rant for hours as to why this story makes no sense in the mcu but i dont want to bore anyone
Mar 13 2019,positive,decent movie especially with sam jackson however bries monotone acting soured the film quite a bit her character is terrible in endgame being annoyingly prideful
Mar 13 2019,negative,this movie over all was bad too slow the plot made no sence looks llike when they wrote the scrip for the tercer act the producer forgot to watch captain america there was no point for the engine that was supose to safe the day and im not saying i hate women but simply the movie was bad its better if you wait until you can find it in the dollar theater instead of wasting 11 dollars in one of the worst marvel movies next to iron man 3 and thor 2
Mar 13 2019,negative,most boring movie marvel ever made poorly cast nothing we have never seen before no excitement lame action scenes could have done so much more with this movie
Mar 13 2019,positive,loved it and love the taste of troll tears
