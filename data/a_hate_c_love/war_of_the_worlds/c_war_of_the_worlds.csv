Apr 12 2024,positive, scifi thriller based on hg wellss novel directed by steven spielberg and starring tom cruise when aliens invade earth divorced dock worker ray ferrier attempts to save his estranged family from the rampaging extraterrestrials steven spielbergs adaptation of the hg wells classic previously filmed in 1953 is a spectacular disaster epic of two halves the first and much the superior hour is a masterclass in escalating tension with grandiose and brilliantly executed sequences following in rapid succession  the bizarre lightning storm that prefigures the eruption of the alien tripod war machines from beneath the earth is an astonishing opening salvo unusually for a specialeffects blockbuster the human drama is transfixing as divorced dock worker tom cruise flees the invasion with his two estranged children played by justin chatwin and dakota fanning its in the second hour that the story begins to wilt most crucially when the suspenseevaporating cgi aliens are revealed the imaginative details a blazing train hurtling out of control the river of dead bodies also begin to peter out until a rather abrupt ending in which hollywood schmaltz wins the day
Aug 5 2022,positive, in steven spielbergs science fiction war of the worlds remains something of an oddity its outlook on the prospect of humanalien interaction is bleak and stands as an antithesis to the directors optimistic aliens in close encounters of the third kind et the extraterrestrial and even those alienlike robots at the end of ai artificial intelligence and while it contains similar misgivings about technology as spielbergs jurassic park and minority report it holds none of their purist fascination with the science of the story aliens heatrays and subterranean tripods are all very deadly as a translation of hg wells seminal alien invasion tale the film moves the action from england to the united states and while modernizing the source material allows spielberg to deliver a spectacle of alien destruction that on the surface sets aside his familyfriendly label but the adaptation maintains many of the original texts most controvertible arguably convenient flourishes so that in spite of the films global cataclysm incited by worldconquering aliens its epic scope remains centralized on a single familys experiences during the takeover and therefore its every bit as intimate as one would expect from steven spielberg spielbergs film follows the long tradition of wells seminal book and its many adaptations by standing as a reflection of scientific social or political events germane to its place in history with his book wells had anticipated the end of the victorian era and the worst potential dangers in the coming century where science and technology would rule supreme later adaptations only solidified that notion in 1938 as radio listeners tunedin to hear the usual rumblings of war in europe with hitlers rise orson welles sent half of new englands listeners running for the hills with his legendarily realistic radio broadcast later producer george pal and director byron haskin made an effectsladen spectacular in their 1953 adaptation the war of the worlds a film that played on the red scare and hoped for divine intervention and spielbergs 2005 film written by david koepp and josh friedman channeled 911 and consciously incorporated parallels to the thencurrent iraq war still fresh in viewers minds when one of the characters sees destruction all around her aliens dont enter her mind she immediately asks is it the terrorists skies fill with clouds as robotic machines topple entire cities but spielberg finds poignant moments of humanity in familiar imagessuch as a father running with his daughter in his arms both covered in ashimages not unfamiliar for those versed in 911 or any catastrophes news footage its release was accompanied by a marketing campaign to match the largerthanlife collaboration between hollywoods most bankable director and its most popular star tom cruise the two had already worked together on minority report in 2002 but the global scale here was far more enormous millions were spent to produce and market the picture and the posters showcased colossal letters that recalled the fonts from such past epics as benhur 1959 and king of kings 1961 six months before the films release analysts predicted it would be the years biggest hit it was fourth and perhaps spielbergs largest earnerits certainly among his largest budgets but just a few weeks before its independence day weekend opening on june 29 2005 cruise appeared on the oprah winfrey show jumped for love on oprahs couch and became something of a laughing stock in the public eye his erratic behavior was vaguely attributed to his association with the unpopular church of scientology cruises promotional interviews centered on his newfound love with future exwife katie holmes and the film itself was lost in the discussions some would argue that the public had grown weary of cruise and despite war of the worlds stateside boxoffice take of 200 million the film would have done better without the increasingly skewed perception of its star at any rate critical responses were equally circumscribed and seldom passionate their assessments lost in the special fx visceral nature and sheer size of the experience over the characters and their emotional underpinnings which is oddly enough what makes war of the worlds far more lasting than any version before it andrew sarris argued overall the film is too lacking in feeling to provide a recognizably human experience on the flipside other critics expected a film of broader worldly scope as the title implies and felt the spectacle was lost in the entrenched humanity referring to the way the film avoids a typical blockbuster formula and does not require its heroes to save the day the critic in the new york post wrote this disappointing war of the worlds limps to a conclusion that mercifully ensures there will not be a sequel indeed the films scifi logic and largescale exhibition were less spielbergs concern next to his desire to create a familiar iconographic atmosphere that the audience could not ignore on an emotional level after all roland emmerich had already made a worldwide alien invasion movie with independence day 1996 a film about blowing up monuments the world over spielbergs film reminds us that amid the global horrors are personal stories about individuals perhaps morgan freemans offscreen bookend narration feels somewhat misplaced here then his voice of authority suggests something big is on the horizon it opens the film and tells us aliens have watched our planet with envy and made plans and at the end explains how the invading race is wiped out by ordinary microscopic earth organisms to which humans are immune in between freemans grand observations new jersey divorc√© ray ferrier tom cruise in his most natural of performances takes his rebellious son robbie justin chatwin and anxious daughter rachel dakota fanning excellent from his exwife miranda otto for the weekend and his rocky parentchild interactions continue even after an unearthly storm looms overhead near his disheveled bachelor pad lightning strikes the same spot again and again and suddenly all electricity from batteries to city power goes out killed by an electromagnetic pulse all at once theres a rumbling from under the city street surface at the lightnings point of impact and then the ground caves in and from inside emerges a tripoda threelegged robotic machine armed with heatrays that reduce its victims to ash rattled unequipped as a parent and unsure what to do ray gathers his children who take no comfort from their unnervedbuttrying father ray finds the last working automobile in his neighborhood and with children in tow sets out to find his ex but crossing a displaced countryside wrought with tripod attacks an airliner crash gearedup military forces and panicky masses primes ray into a protective father mode along with cruises damaged public profile in 2005 the films minor plot holes led to an underestimation of war of the worlds even today those searching for scifi logic in a film about a familys survival question why a bystander is spotted recording the tripod on his digital camcorder after the aliens electromagnetic pulse zapped all electronics but then as viewers we only assume the electromagnetic pulse there is no scientist or resident expert in the film to explain whats going onwe have to feel our way through it other debatably inconsequential plot holes occur making it so the film may not stand up to microscopically close inspection but such analyses overlook the sheer energy with which spielberg has assembled his productionanother driving force behind war of the worlds in that regard the film has much in common with jurassic park whereby captivating human characters run from a towering deathly force all delivered with great cinematic bravado and within this nonstop scenario spielberg orchestrates moments of pure filmmaking that remain spectacular upon repeated viewings consider the deceptively simple sequence where ray and his children navigate through stalled traffic in a minivan cinematographer janusz kaminskis camera movements bob and weave passed stopped cars and hordes of stranded drivers the frame whooshing in and out of the van thanks to cgi circulating around what in another filmmakers hands mightve been a dull sequence filmed entirely inside a car beyond moments where spielberg echoes 911 imagery he also makes incredible use of the tripods imposing stature they tower over crowds or move through cities with vast slow steps that implant them in the viewers memory as iconographic cinemashots best described as epic and ambitious but war of the worlds is at its best when spielberg breaks the massive scope to explore themes of family amid the frightened mob mentality prevalent throughout the film theres a microcosmic sequence where tim robbins appears as a paranoid survivalist named harlan who makes deranged plans for a rebellion in the cellar of an old farmhouse the scene serving as a metaphor for the entire picture harlans behavior incites ray to blossom into a fullfledged protector after they narrowly avoid the alien equivalent to a fiberscope and then an alien survey team ray is forced to fight and kill harlan in fear that his loud ranting will alert the aliens cruise is excellent in these scenes and delivers a complete growth of character in his performance emphasizing the films overarching theme of human bonding during and after a massive catastrophe reflecting post911 patriotism moreover cruises role is uncommon in spielbergs filmography in that the directors films usually concern families or children with absent father figures here as in minority report cruise represents a deeply flawed father who through the course of the film restores some shattered levels of balance to his family even after robbie seemingly dies in a wave of fire when he abandons ray and rachel to fight aliens with the us army the film reunites robbie in what some consider an alltooconvenient conclusion then again this plot detail is drawn directly from wells who reunited the books narratorprotagonist with his presumeddead wife by the last pages american audiences accustomed to blockbusters of mass destruction in 2005 felt war of the worlds was a letdown and wasnt the crowdpleasing popcornmunching nobrainer that independence day was then again its worth noting that the critics at frances cahiers du cin√©ma usually ahead of the curve put the film on their top ten list for the yeara curious choice for any film thats just another blockbuster of course no spielberg film operates on one level alone and this film is certainly no exception had the films marketing campaign not suggested another kind of film of roland emmerich ilk and focused instead on the deeply human struggle at its center war of the worlds may have been perceived differently but spielberg avoids grotesque cutaways to paris burning rio de janeiros christ the redeemer toppling over or the white house exploding his imagery is more affecting and invariably human and his focus on a single family amid a worldwide conflict would inspire the narrative structures of later blockbusters such as world war z and 2014s godzilla highly influential ever innovative and full of emotion and slick formal trickery the film lives up to the precise definition of what steven spielbergs war of the worlds should be
Jul 29 2022,positive,cruise is in fine dramatic form and spielbergs journey to the dark side is superbly realised 
Jul 9 2022,positive, steven spielberg takes on the granddaddy of all alien invasion stories with war of the worlds 2005 his contemporary adaptation of the hg wells novel fifty years after the first big screen version thrilled audiences tom cruise is the screwup of a divorced dad emotionally cutoff from his kids who connects with his paternal instincts to protect his children dakota fanning and justin chatwin when his new jersey neighborhood is assaulted by alien creatures that burst from the concrete streets and destroy everythingand everyonewithin their reach spielberg is a master at staging both epic scenes of disaster and intimate moments of terror and triumph the imagery is epic and the effects thrilling the storms above the bridge by rays new jersey home the cracking pavement as alien tripods rise from the ground and march through civilization like an invading army of spidery giants the death rays that sweep the streets and leave dust where people once stood the survival odyssey keeps is grounded in the family trying to survive the onslaught giving us everything from their limited perspective in the midst of a nightmare cruise takes direction amazingly well and delivers an impressive physical performance as his failed father rises to the occasion and risks everything to protect his children from the invasion but he still cant manage to emote and he doesnt allow the audience to connect to spielbergs strongest impulses family devotion sacrifice for a loved one for that the film relies on young dakota fanning whose wide eyes and little girl shrieks really express the sense of the world unraveling tim robbins is memorable as a survivalist who saves cruise and fanning only to fall prey to his own shockinduced obsession miranda otto costars and gene barry and ann robinson stars of the original 1953 film makes cameos as the grandparents morgan freeman chimes in as narrator in the opening and closing moments dont miss a single recommendation subscribe to the stream on demand weekly newsletter your email address will not be shared and follow us on facebook and x formerly known as twitter sean axmaker is a seattle film critic and writer he writes the weekly newspaper column stream on demand and the companion website and his work appears at rogerebertcom turner classic movies online the film noir foundation and parallax view

Oct 16 2021,positive,  from hg wells to philip k dick the titans of scifi literature have been keeping filmmakers busy for decades as denis villeneuve becomes the latest director to grapple with frank herberts epic dune we remember 10 times they struck gold with its immense worldbuilding vast ensemble of characters and complicated mix of politics and religion frank herberts 1965 novel dune is almost a textbook study in the challenges of adaptation approached in the early 1970s no doubt for his desert work on lawrence of arabia 1962 david lean declined to head a film adaptation as relayed in frank pavichs documentary jodorowskys dune 2013 chilean cult director alejandro jodorowsky spent much time and 2 million developing a film version in the mid1970s only to run aground on his own improbable ambitions hollywood proved terminally resistant to his proposed running time of 10 to 14 hours after ridley scott eventually abandoned another lengthy attempt to develop dune into two films dino de laurentiis hired david lynch in what would be his first  and last  studio film and his most compromised work without final cut lynch disowned the finished product 1984 which bombed critically and financially yet the results remain a mesmerising folly merging the very different sensibilities of herbert and lynch into something rich and strange john harrison adapted the novel into a faithful if somewhat flat and prosaic miniseries for scifi channel that misses jodorowskys and lynchs unworldly eccentricity and now fresh from the scifi of arrival 2016 and blade runner 2049 2017 denis villeneuve brings the first of his own twopart adaptation of dune with a possible third to cover subsequent novels as we draw closer to the longawaited uk release of villeneuves dune here are 10

victor frankenstein is now called henry colin clive although confusingly there is another unrelated character here called victor frankenstein now has a hunchbacked servant named fritz renamed igor in later sequels while the monster boris karloff is an inarticulate brute the climax takes place atop a blazing bavarian windmill rather than the arctic ice floes yet the films iconography would itself come to influence much subsequent horror aladdins lamp in a physics laboratory comments doc ostrow warren stevens having just witnessed dr edward morbius walter pidgeon use an alien mindreading device

fantastical literature like the 17thcentury syrian storyteller hanna diyabs aladdin on science fiction fred m wilcoxs futureset feature in fact owes its greatest debt to a rather different tale of wizardry for in their shared exile on a distant planet morbius and his daughter resemble the similarly isolated prospero and miranda from william shakespeares stage play the tempest while robby the robot and the monster from the id evoke prosperos enchanted servants ariel and caliban only the arrival of an allmale space crew can break morbiuss magical grip over the planet in 1948 arthur c clarke wrote his short story the sentinel  concerning an alien artefact discovered on the moon  for a bbc competition where it failed to place he first published it in 1951 as sentinel of eternity in 1964 director stanley kubrick started collaborating with clarke on a new sciencefiction film inspired by the sentinel and several other short stories by clarke initially they planned to cowrite a new novel followed by an adapted screenplay but in fact both would end up being written concurrently with the novel published in clarkes name only shortly after the films 1968 release  one year before the first actual manned lunar landing this is an unusual case of book and movie codeveloping and coexisting there are many minor differences in their plot details but most significantly of all kubrick translates clarkes verbal work into a near wordless abstraction for the eyes john w campbell jrs 1938 novella who goes there published under the pen name don a stuart will forever be associated with both christian nybys loose adaptation the thing from another world 1951 and john carpenters much more faithful rendering the thing 1982  but barreling between these two scifi horrors was eugenio

robert a heinleins hugo awardwinning 1959 novel starship troopers is a comingofage interplanetary war story whose future militarist earth is either federal utopia or fascist dystopia according to the readers own ideological perspective  an ambiguity that has earned the work considerable controversy over the decades the eversubversive paul verhoeven unsurprisingly embraces this aspect in his

works the source for among others ridley scotts blade runner 1982 paul verhoevens total recall 1990 and steven spielbergs minority report 2002 yet these were all rather loose reimaginings whereas richard linklaters 2006 feature cleaves very closely to dicks original 1977 novel using genre and a barely futuristic setting as a scramble suit to disguise its status as a semiautobiographical elegy for the toll taken by drug addiction on dicks friends and himself in the early 1970s with the same rotoscoping technique that he had used in his waking life 2001 linklater transforms the faces of familiar stars into cartoons its the perfect visual analogue for all the disorientation and dissociation of dicks novel whose brainaltered burnouts have become alienated from the world around them and their own sense of self stanislaw lems 1986 short story one human minute presents itself as a review of a miraculous impossible book that reduces all human activities from a 60second period to an exhaustive set of statistics both literary and metaliterary lems tale defines unfilmable  and indeed a voiceover at the beginning of pater sparrows adaptation suggests paradoxically that the only consolation for the books existence is that no one could make it into a film sparrow sets his film in a despotic dystopia and has the book suddenly appear overnight on the shelves of a closed secondhand book dealership the increasingly alarmed authorities scrambling to understand the origins meaning and implications of the books destabilising content detain all the stores staff in a sanatorium repurposed for interrogation the result is a mystery all at once of the lockedroom political and theological varieties and an adaptation in no way merely by numbers born a century ago

Feb 15 2021,negative, whatever commentary it may be on the present state of american studio filmmaking steven spielberg remains one of its more skilled practitioners he is one of the few capable of organizing script actors camera and effects in such a fashion that his concerns are communicated in an entertaining fashion to large numbers of people unfortunately he is not burdened with great or important ideas so that while the undertaking is often successful in the more immediate sense it generally fails to perform the larger tasks confronting art and filmmaking one knows more or less what to expect if there has been a darkening in spielbergs films recently with artificial intelligence minority report and now war of the worlds this must be attributed to growing concerns within certain social layers about the state and direction of american society all is clearly not well again however the gloomier vein has not yet yielded extraordinary insights the filmmaker always seems in the end too complacent and too canny to make the kind of effort it takes to get to the bottom of things spielbergs war of the worlds is loosely based on the 1898 science fiction novel by hg wells 18661946 about a remorseless attack by martian invaders on the earths population wells author of the time machine 1895 the island of dr moreau 1896 the invisible man 1897 and the first men in the moon 1901 apparently had several perhaps conflicting concerns in mind with his the war of the worlds on the one hand the author an evolutionary socialist identifies the english victims of the alien invasion with animal species such as the bison and the dodo upon which the human race has wrought ruthless and utter destruction as well as the inferior races such as the tasmanian aboriginals entirely swept out of existence in a war of extermination waged by european immigrants in the space of fifty years this ambiguityare the invaders a monstrous them or are they in fact a no less monstrous ushardly finds a place in orson welless notorious 1938 radio version which resonated with the rise of nazism or the byron haskinsgeorge pal 1953 film featuring gene barry and ann robinson who have cameo roles in spielbergs work the latter quite spectacular and entertaining in its own way has cold war and religious overtones in the newest rendition of wellss story in my view the degree to which that ambiguity is treated or neglected largely determines the success or failure of the work screenwriter david koepp and spielberg have transposed the drama to contemporary america ray ferrier tom cruise is a new jersey dockworker divorced with two children in a rather clich√©d fashion the filmmakers portray ferrier as an irresponsible soul perhaps more attached to his automobile than his offspring predictably events will put him to the test and family values will triumph alien fighting machines newly activated come out of the ground where they have been stored for eons they immediately wreak devastating havoc with one of the few working automobiles ferrier heads for his exwifes house in the suburbs and when she proves to have left for her parents home eventually for boston several hundred miles away en route ferrier his young daughter dakota fanning and recalcitrant teenage son justin chatwin encounter along with the general population more than their share of terrors and horrors the intruders from another planet are intent on exterminating earths population or breeding them for feeding purposes the vampirish element is present in wellss original book in the end the aliens succumb as they do in the previous versions of the story to a surprising nemesis the initial scenes of ferrier and his family fleeing incomprehensible death and destruction are affecting the attempt to recreate something of the impact of the september 11 attacks on the lives of ordinary people is a legitimate one spielberg is someone who can do this sort of thing the sight of the bayonne bridge collapsing in the background or bits of clothes and body parts floating through the air is disturbing and frightening effective as well are the sequences of refugees trudging down roads and highways desperately seizing ferriers car fighting for a place on a doomed ferry at the same time as the americans are victims along with the unseen rest of the worlds population there are hints of other realities ferriers son is writing a paper on the french in algeria a sinister survivalist tim robbins tells ferrier occupations never work history has taught us that a thousand times the disproportion between the military might of the invaders and that of the humans suggests nothing so much as the present situation in iraq or afghanistan with cruise attempting at one point to become a suicide bomber these hints are clearly intentional spielberg told a press conference but i just felt that this movie is a reflection and there are all sorts of metaphors that you can certainly divine from this storythis movie i was hoping would be more like a prism everybody could see in a facet of the prism what they choose to take from the experience of seeing war of the worlds so i tried to make it as open for interpretation as possible without having anybody coming out with a huge political polemic in the second act of the movie as opposed to roland emmerichs independence day which borrows much of the structure of wellss novel but transforms it into a rousing tribute to american militarism and chauvinism spielberg and koepp have kept the jingoism to a relative minimum the latter told a reporter people might use this version of war of the worlds as a mirror to reflect what they already believe some people will look at it and say its clearly about post911 american paranoia terrorism and our fear of terrorism sleeper cells waiting to be activated some people will feel that because americans already feel victimized and threatened people elsewhere in the world who also feel victimized and threatened might say its about iraq and their fear of an american invasion the notion that americans can be both victims and victimizers is perhaps not the alpha and omega of political understanding but it might be the starting point for critical thought the films ambiguities are enough to have earned the wrath of the extreme right a leftwing propaganda piece against the war on terror is what one hostile commentator terms it and these ambiguities could not slip past the evervigilant edward rothstein culture criticatlarge for the new york times who can generally be counted upon to contribute his rather filthy two cents rothstein compares spielbergs effort unfavorably with wellss remarking that there is a strange ambivalence in the film as if the issues surrounding responses to such terrorist attacks made mr spielberg uneasy the movie also keeps trying to ward off the spirit of militarism the situation elsewhere requires mr robbinss character is a twisted militant hapless disturbed and dangerous tom cruises advice against attacking a martian in a basement is just common sense but when near the movies end he urges a soldier not to shoot it seems as if some other message were being italicized rothstein goes on to register other perhaps more burning concerns some of this may be related to the movie mr spielberg interrupted to make war of the worlds it is said to begin with the murders of israeli olympic athletes by palestinian terrorists in 1972an attack martianlike in its ambitions but the analogy mr spielbergs comments suggest will be undermined injustices suffered by the attackers will need to be understood and their victims tactics questioned the times columnist adds perhaps that idea of terrorists with a cause and defenders with doubts influenced the discomfort felt in the current film as well spielbergs strange ambivalence uneasiness and discomfort to which rothstein refers contemptuously with implications that the filmmaker is soft on terrorism make up the strongest element of war of the worlds the most human element that rothstein praises the spirit of militarism and disdains the protagonists urging of a soldier not to shoot is a commentary on the generally brutalized mentality of the erstwhile american liberal intelligentsia contrary to rothstein the great weakness ultimately of the film is that its ambivalence unease and discomfort about american realities in general and the war on terror in particular are not placed in the forefront developed or worked through to the end in fact the artistic and dramatic failings of the work are to a certain extent perhaps largely traceable to spielbergs and presumably koepps tentativeness and timidity in regard to these critical questions having established in a relatively artistic and potentially rewarding manner a connection a resonance between the reimagined episodes of wellss novel and contemporary events americans under attack refugees in their own country the filmmakers largely fail to follow up on their accomplishment admittedly the task was somewhat challenging how to remain faithful at least in spirit to the original story while continuing to hint at parallels between the science fiction narrative and our reality well something could have been done as it is the film largely stops in its tracks or goes off in an entirely wrong direction oddly enough adherence to the original more or less proves to be the means by which the filmmakers manifest their inability or unwillingness to treat concretely the more controversial and complex aspects of the present situationin other words precisely to advance their own ambivalence uneasiness and discomfort in this case such adherence proves to be the line of least resistance fidelity to wellss tale which in any event is not such an imperishable classic would seem to be a secondary matter as a consequence the characters plight becomes entirely abstract more and more divorced from any presentday reverberations and the film turns into a rather conventional if exceptionally macabre horrorscience fiction film the promising hints and ambiguities are largely abandoned as happens far too often these days having reached an artistic or intellectual impasse spielberg and koepp rely on the monstrous the morbid the grotesque or special effects latter portions of the film are simply distasteful without adding any particular insight one is left disturbed by the film with a bad taste in ones mouth but not necessarily for the right reasons or about the right things and that was not inevitable
Nov 9 2020,positive, o one in the 21st century would have believed that earth was being watched by intelligences greater than their own for potentially millions of years humanity as it reached its peak was always too caught up in their infinite complacency confident of supremacy over the planet but in the cold dark reaches of space aliens have been plotting to take the valuable resources of this planet  by force with a war of the worlds looming ray ferrier tom cruise is the perspective of commonplace sensibility hes a crane operator at a shipyard dependable above and beyond his coworkers but still observant of union rules and he struggles to provide for his two children rachel dakota fanning playing the perfectly precocious voice of reason and robbie justin chatwin donning the role of angsty rebellious teen while also hoping to bond with them and appear as a role model but both are problems considering that hes divorced sharing custody of the kids with his exwife mary ann miranda otto and competing with their wealthy stepdad tim david alan basche youve got nothing to worry about when mary ann drops the siblings off with their father for the weekend ray plans for an uneventful couple of days after all hes a working man and he needs his sleep but before the day is through a storm mysteriously materializes overhead lashing out with freakishly antagonistic lightning bolts forcing ray and rachel back into the house when curiosity gets the better of ray he races into the center of town to investigate the commotion and the pinpoint target of all the electrical strikes the initial alien appearance is unmistakably reminiscent of independence day as furious clouds swirl above hinting at an extraterrestrial invasion but when the invaders do arrive they come from beneath the ground springing up on thin nimble legs like mechanical octopi or tripodal automatons the level of destruction also matches that aforementioned scifi thriller with buildings rupturing and cars getting tossed about as infrastructure crumbles its also quite sudden the action and adventure is quite significant especially as panic takes hold and the attackers begin razing everything in sight its here that some of the most memorable sets are designed with a massive plane resting in sections across a lawn as the best of the bunch though the wreckage conveniently leaves their parked van untouched and when images of chaos and catastrophe are most potent including a stream full of drifting bodies or articles of clothing raining from the sky as if predicting the rise of the modern zombie craze director steven spielbergs vision of an alien takeover includes understandable paranoia uncontrollable crowds of confused and violent survivors and sprawling fleers and the very worst qualities of humanity emerging triumphant even for the protagonist who is forced to make tough moral decisions concerning his familys survival as with most of his ventures the film also puts children directly in the path of the annihilation imparting a sense of innocence and greater unpreparedness with parenting efforts a key point of contention and drama expectedly adults are just as impulsive incompetent and ineffective as the screaming youths unfortunately this somewhat realistic portrayal results in plenty of annoying moments as characters behave contrarily to largerthanlife heroes and leads to an ending that cant match the riveting start but the carnage is more colossal than in most disaster movies the sound effects are chilling the sets are spectacularly ominous the cg is impressive and the desperation is more psychologically trying though the pg13 rating creates obvious limitations for the visualized atrocities it may not be a masterpiece but its a fitting adaptation of a seminal hg wells scifi epic designed by mike massie   20062024 gone with the twins  all movie related images  their respective owners articles on this site may not be distributed or reproduced without written consent

Nov 18 2019,positive, tom cruise may be making headlines with his recent behavior but even cruises bad boy antics cant sink war of the worlds the steven spielberg adaptation of the hg wells novel features plenty of chills and thrills making it one of the summers bigticket releases that actually lives up to the hype cruise plays ray a dock worker and divorced dad trying to connect with his estranged children justin chatwin and dakota fanning during a weekend visit the familys struggles take a back seat when a bizarre lightning storm proves to be the precursor to an attack by beings from another world cruise carries the picture and even manages to make me forget about the fact that he might be having a very public midlife crisis fanning is fine but i cant help but think her career goes out the door when she reaches adolescence spielberg does a masterful job of building the tension and creating an effective sciencefiction thriller the films strongest moments come during two edgeofyourseat sequences the first attack is the films best which really had me anticipating what was going to happen next that sequence is nearly topped by an attack on a ferry that reminded me a lot of the final half of titanic with its panicinduced hysteria combined with jawdropping destruction these two scenes really push the envelope when it comes to the films pg13 rating this isnt a movie for younger children but it helps enhance the effectiveness of the films rather grim feel war of the worlds does suffer from a disappointing final act the usually reliable tim robbins is slightly out of place in a small role and the wrapup seems rushed and rather convenient still its much more satisfying than spielbergs ai which left most audiences feeling frustrated and cheated war of the worlds doesnt reach the heights of spielbergs last collaboration with cruise minority report but it still sets the bar pretty high with the exception of star wars this may be the summer seasons best highprofile event this weeks discount dud is the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy c an average sciencefiction adventure that probably will appeal more to the fans of the popular book and bbc miniseries that the film is based on the plot is simple brit arthur dent martin freeman is rescued by his friend an alien in disguise ford prefect mos def right before earth is destroyed there were moments in hitchhiker where i was mildly amused including a musical number by dolphins right before they leave earth but for the most part the dry british humor just fell flat it was like watching a gag reel of all the monty python moments that didnt work part of the problem could have been the cast freeman and mos def just arent that dynamic in their respective roles hitchhiker does throw in small parts for john malkovich and bill nighy as well as speaking parts for helen mirren and alan rickman but none is given enough screen time to connect the best performance comes from sam rockwell who plays the president of the galaxy as sort of a cross between george bush and jim morrison but even rockwell isnt enough to prevent this from being middleoftheroad i can respect what everyone involved was trying to do in the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy but that doesnt mean i have to like it or recommend it to anyone else the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy opens friday at the plaza 6 where all movies are 150 sportswritermovie reviewer micheal compton is so tired of evil aliens in film he is taking the rest of the summer off to find more cute and cuddly etlike aliens if he has time he will answer your questions about films or aliens just drop him a line at mcomptonbgdailynewscom

Aug 21 2018,positive, steven spielbergs war of the worlds is a movie at once authentically unsettling and deeply nostalgic the nostalgia is for scary longcherished fantasias concerning alien invasions and men from mars as filtered through boyhood comic books and drivein movies and tattered paperbacks a whole century of cheap thrills summed up and transfigured in a return to their primal source hg wellss 1898 novel but spielberg doesnt try to reproduce the camp goofiness of mars attacks or the video game hijinks of independence day he wants us to care about what is happening in front of us as if we were contemplating this scenario for the first time that would require a return to childhood a return to the childhood of the genre to which he has devoted so much of his energy and to whose historical permutations he can and in this movie does allude almost reflexively in passing i registered fleeting virtually subliminal hints of the birds alien night of the living dead the day of the triffids panic in year zero quartermass and the pit and the poseidon adventure not to mention spielbergs own jurassic park whose raptor in the kitchen is paralleled here by aliens in the basement we would need to feel again how much our nostalgia is imbued with real terror even if it was a terror at one remove just distant enough that we were able to play inside it war of the worlds aspires to be a compendium of wells and all that sprang from wells an allinone package that might serve as something like a childs introduction to cosmic fear it feels inevitable that the movie should come to revolve around the haunted face of a child the inscrutably traumatized tenyearold played with an intensity in itself rather disturbing by dakota fanning the world seems particularly expendable in spielbergs opening scenes when we see it from the vantage point of tom cruises ray ferrier a new jersey dockworker living in disordered solitude since his wife left him and brimming with hostility at the prospect of being dumped with the kids while his ex goes off for the weekend with her new partner cruise in a performance more restrained than he has been giving on television lately manages capably his characters journey out of sullenness into the sustained urgency that the rest of the picture requires of him but it is not a role that calls on much range spielbergs foray into kitchensink realism conjures up a mood of dead ends of life as a continual round of taunting and bickering in prefab houses imagine the movie continuing in this vein without the arrival of the aliens in the eventno surprisethe extraterrestrial invasion will provide a chance for some real quality time enabling ray to discover that he does actually care whether his children live or die this family drama seems too calculated an interpolation fulfilling too neatly the hollywood requirement that all movies must involve the redemption of at least one central character the hg wells novel followed a more austere and solitary course as its anonymous hero mostly hid out and watched from the sidelines while the disaster unfolded he was there as an observer it was the fate of the race that was in question here we are often distracted from the magnitude of the catastrophe by worrying about what will happen to ray his teenage son and his tenyearold daughter as ifwith inescapable movie logicthe fate of the rest of humanity took second place to rays need to establish a good relationship with his kids and get them safely back to their mother in boston it is hard to work up much interest in a redemption that is a foregone conclusion but it doesnt matter much since the overwhelming speed and scale of the events that overtake this family unit leave them blessedly little time for extended conversation after the son runs off to join up with the soldiers who are counterattacking the aliensthe dialogue suggests a floating analogy with the iraq warwe are down to father and daughter with cruise hoarsely singing the beach boys little deuce coupe as a consoling lullaby in the face of ultimate horror and fanning beginning to take on the aura of a designated martyr for humanity in general in a world where the worst suffering is to survive    those who have escaped the dark and terrible aspects of life will find my brutality my flash of rage in our final tragedy easy enough to blame but those who have been under the shadow who have gone down at last to elemental things will have a wider charity  spielberg enacts a comparable scene in which ray is forced to kill the raving survivalist played rather hammily by tim robbins who has offered them refuge and must blindfold his daughter so that she catches no glimpse of the act the blindfolded eyes serve to underscore the recurring image of dakota fannings wideopen eyes elsewhere in the film while the matteroffact bluntness of the offscreen killing weighs more heavily than the explosions fireballs and flying debris that accompany the advancing aliens its a bleak and rigorous moment that offsets the impulse here and there indulged to unleash the special effects for the full summer blockbuster joyride war of the worlds is scary in all the places where its supposed to be in the splitting apart of the pavement as the aliensplanted underground long agofirst emerge in their attack in their giant tripods on the ferry boat trying to cross the hudson to evade them in the exploratory twisting of the aliens extensible observation arm through the basement where the humans cower silently spielberg does this sort of thing as well as any director ever has and still seems to enjoy it the catastrophe is delivered as promised as it must be to fulfill the promise of an adrenalinefueled theme park ride to keep the american summernot to mention the american movie businessalive some of the most efficiently scary scenesthat arm in the basement for instance which is milked for all its worthserve as something like comfort food reassuring us that weve seen this sort of thing before but that this time its going to be better than ever yet the movie is full of indications that spielberg wants if not to spoil the fun then at least to complicate it to lace it with a dash of what might even be anguish he wants to let something of the real world in most markedly through visual echoes of september 11 and its aftermath on one hand the movie is a game a conscious display if we needed it at this stage of spielbergs technical mastery on the other it reaches toward what might be prophecy or passionate allegory or exhortation to mindfulness of real human suffering this is where the unsettling part comes in because for all his deliberateness as a filmmaker spielberg cannot altogether control the undertones of despair and gnawing anxiety that his images elicit that conflict between uncomplicated fun and realworld grief can hardly be resolved in spielbergs movie but the pressure it creates finds its outlet in certain images of exceptional beauty its in the scenes of the martians themselves and the devastation they wreak that spielberg finds a way out of his dilemma in vistas that have the solemnity of one of john martins victorian tableaux of the day of judgment he plants the alien tripod machines with their annihilating heat rays and their spindly legs that flex like tendrilswith a dedicated fidelity to the descriptions of hg wells that make them look positively antiqueinto a world just drab and wounded enough to pass for real the aura of virtual historical reality that spielberg labored to create for the ghetto takeover in schindlers list or the omaha beach landing in saving private ryan is here imparted to an invasion that might as well be historical the devastation of twentyfirstcentury new jersey by illustrations from a victorian scientific romance these almost fussily perfect vistas like the extraordinary moment when the alien machines are seen from a distance standing kneedeep in the hudson to feed on their human prey evoke a peculiar kind of history painting landscape with tripods perhaps an exercise in the spielbergian sublime where what devastates us does from a certain angle possess an undeniable abstract beauty these spacious setups have a gaudy splendor far removed from the cramped dullness of the ordinary world on which the aliens intruded a world in which the sole note of aesthetic liveliness was provided by a childrens cartoon show the effect is of reliving scenes we experienced in the novel in orson welless notorious radio play in the comic book and in the 1953 movie version but with the suggestion that this time theyre really at hand we have arrived at that apocalypse so assiduously imagined in all its variations for the last hundred years the foundering of the everyday and its shockingly abrupt replacement by a different order of things an order from which there can apparently be no more than a temporary escape earth is overgrown with red alien weeds the movie fulfills itself in such images even if it cannot sustain their mood into the final scenes spielberg is faithful to the rough outline of the novelthe sudden collapse of the aliens and the revelation that they have died from exposure to earths bacteriabut he cannot give it the solemnity of wellss last pages here the wrapup seems almost as perfunctory as one of those fifties scifi movies where the air force discovers say that the flying saucers are susceptible to highfrequency noises and saves the planet in the last five minutes the difference is that in wells the protagonist walks through a dead and emptied londonthe windows in the white houses were like the eye sockets of skullsand is utterly alone when he hears the wailing of the dying martians ulla ulla ulla ulla the scene like many in the novel has an uncanny poetry that in spielbergs version is crowded out by the mob of onlookers and soldiers who make nonsense of the idea that the human race has come close to extinction    by the toll of a billion deaths man has bought his birthright of the earth and it is his against all comers it would still be his were the martians ten times as mighty as they are for neither do men live nor die in vain  but this is a passive victory a triumph of evolutionary biology and further on characteristically wellss narrator changes course again after indulging a reverie about human life spreading slowly from this little seed bed of the solar system throughout the inanimate vastness of sidereal space he brings himself up short it may be on the other hand that the destruction of the martians is only a reprieve to them and not to us perhaps is the future ordained wellss narrator follows this with an observation that might be the unspoken epigram of spielbergs movie i must confess the stress and danger of the time have left an abiding sense of doubt and insecurity in my mind the doubt and insecurity permeate the film even if the director acknowledges with a final scene of the family all safely reunited that there might be a limit to how much insecurity his audience will tolerate in hg wellss novel the narrator who tells us of the martian invasion refers to his subject as the great disillusionment spielbergs theme will i suppose be described by some as the loss of innocence the american innocence that has been lost so many times only apparently to regenerate so that it may be lost yet again the innocence lost in his film would be a lack of awareness of just how vulnerable we are to destruction by unknown forces wellss disillusionment is much broader in its scope just as his novel contains within it the seeds of a thousand variations including the 1953 film produced by george pal with its ambience of nuclear terror graphic interpretations by artists ranging from edward gorey to lou cameron whose comic book version for classics illustrated soon to be reissued is a model of spareness and restraint a rock opera in the seventies and the 1938 radio production by orson welles which persuaded a good many unwary listeners that they were hearing live breaking news reports of martian invasion the novel has not been exhausted being one of those openended works that combine infinite suggestiveness with the most rudimentary of narratives the martians are more intelligent than we are they arrive and devastate us as men would tread on an anthill we would without question be destroyed except for that lucky business of the bacteria the martians somehow failed to anticipate everyone remembers certain instants in wellss bookthe first sighting of what appears to be a falling star the discovery of the cylinder the first encounter with the power of the martian heat raybut as far as plot goes the novel is monotonous in the extreme the monotony comes from the scenes of wartime suffering that from his vantage point wells could only imagine essentially the martians go from place to place and destroy everything they find the humans flee or resist in vain despair loot get drunk die miserably hide out in coal cellars one day it ends because the story is so simple that it can be told in a single sentence wells tells it again and again each time from a different angle his anonymous narratora writer with scientific interests apparently comfortably settled in suburban woking surrey with a wife from whom he is separated for most of the book and an equally sketchy brother inserted none too artfully whose sole function is to provide eyewitness testimony of events taking place in londonis not so much a character as a mind set adrift by circumstance what is most striking in rereading the war of the worlds is how swiftly its moods and angles of vision can lurch from point to point adaptations inevitably smooth over the books texture which is the result of thought revising itself of emotions mutating unpredictably of viewpoints turned on themselves likewise wellss prose can dart from sermonic eloquence to notation as dry as a railroad timetable the confident assertions of nineteenthcentury thought give way to a stammering bluntness as the narrator finds himself unable to tell others what has happened i felt foolish and angry i tried and found i could not tell them what i had seen they laughed again at my broken sentences the book has so often been turned to graphic and cinematic uses that it is easy to forget the changes it works in language alone what wellss narrator meditates on is a game devised by wells himself with a measure of detachment verging on the misanthropic in his experiment in autobiography he described how he wheeled about the district marking down suitable places and people for destruction by my martians the book might then be imagined as the soliloquy of a man who bicycles through the suburbs of 1890s london imagining their devastation along with the devouring of their inhabitants by blooddrinking aliens a secret antisocial fantasy is played out with the enthusiasm of a schoolboy moving pins around on a war map in his private game he becomes complicit with the superintelligent allpowerful casually murderous martians he allows some part of himself to go off on a rampage of vicarious massacre overseen by intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic a company he might well have preferred to the scared scurrying earthlings of the suburbs who play for the most part such an inglorious role in his novel all the same another part of him contemplates the resulting carnage with horrified awe a mood of trauma sets in amplified in various registers by every person he happens to meet like the timorous anemic curate who complains why are these things permitted what are these martians there is no right response because what the martians perceive is by definition beyond us they are the devouring other superior pitiless and unknowable malevolence has nothing to do with it all they can do for human beings besides annihilating them is to provide a momentary occasion to look at the human situation in a different light to reconfigure existing definitions of what humans are at the same time the protagonists disordered wanderings take on a visionary flavor the narrator turns the events over and over finding upsetting metaphors for the events that have occurred and equally upsetting contradictions in the way he reacts to them reliving random encounters and insights in the midst of chaos as if they were episodes in some future scripture it came to me that i was upon this dark common helpless unprotected and alone suddenly like a thing falling upon me from without came fear biblical echoes proliferate even as the hero lashes out for instance at the curates evocation of the great and terrible day of the lord what good is religion if it collapses under calamity did you think god had exempted weybridge he is not an insurance agent man in its way the book belongs to a characteristic english mode of allegorical more or less insular peregrination that can be discerned in works as disparate as the pilgrims progress defoes journal of the plague year john clares hallucinatory account of his journey on foot out of essex and the wind in the willows sebalds the rings of saturn is a recent addition to that canon    something very like the warfever that occasionally runs through a civilized community had got into my blood i can best express my state of mind by saying that i wanted to be in at the death     perhaps i am a man of exceptional moods at times i suffer from the strangest sense of detachment from myself and the world about me i seem to watch it all from the outside from somewhere inconceivably remote out of time out of space out of the stress and tragedy of it all  is a thin layer bounded on one side by the uncontrollable world of microbiology and cellular evolution on the other by the infinite coldness of an outer space that might well spawn an advanced intellect divorced from empathy it is an impersonal and uncontrollable darwinian process that sets up the inhabitants of woking and weybridge to be the victims of a mechanized warfare waged by beings incapable of pity for them and leads to a victorian gentleman being reduced as we do not quite see tom cruise reduced to gnawing the bones of cats and rabbits for sustenance    a persuasion that i was no longer a master but an animal among the animals under the martian heel with us it would be as with them to lurk and watch to run and hide the fear and empire of man had passed away  he imagines himself a rabbit returning to his burrow to find that men have dug it up to lay the foundations of a house such images proliferate like hiding placescomfortless hiding placeswithin the otherwise monotonous accounts of human civilization burned and laid waste wellss novel remains a much tougher work than any of its offspring and a richer one orson welles and his scriptwriter howard koch took one aspect of the storythe breakdown of modern communications under the stress of the invasionand translated it into a still exhilarating game in which radios means were turned against itself and drama culminated in dead air giving the answer to the question isnt anyone there george pals 1953 film turned the book into an efficiently paranoid cold war entertainment with tactical nukes failing to stop the invader civil defense officials politely overseeing mass evacuations and those left behind piling into churches as a last resort with spielberg the trauma of anticipation that animated wells gives way to something like a nostalgia for that trauma its legacy of perverse beautiesthe by now antique images that he lovingly refurbishesis after all so much more bearable than the actual disasters that have followed it is as if in the face of more pressing terrors spielberg sought the comfort of martians for all its faithfulness to the demands of blockbuster filmmakingwith all that implies of playing to emotion and steering away as wells never does from the convolutions of thoughthis movie is also just faithful enough to wells to convey what cold comfort that can be
Aug 15 2013,positive, is it the terrorists a frightened child asks because that is the scariest thing she knows but what makes this thing scary is that it is something no one knows it is beyond our knowledge even beyond our imagination earth is under attack and no one knows by whom or what they want these are not the lets play musical notes together aliens of close encounters of the third kind or the reeses piecesloving bicycleflying botanist alien from et the extraterrestrial theres no take me to your leader or klaatu barada niktu these aliens dont even want to keep humans on as slave labor as in battlefield earth they dont want us to understand or negotiate with them it does not seem to be about power or plunder they just want to destroy us as one character says this is not a war any more than theres a war between men and maggots its an extermination steven spielberg knows two things better than anyone else who ever made a movie and both are in top form here first is his extraordinarily evocative sense of family life the way every detail of home and connection even maybe especially the most frayed of connections tell the story and make us care about it a ribbon a mirror a boot a box of family photographs a beach boys song  the juxtaposition of the ordinary with the unthinkable sustains a golly factor that grabs our throats and our hearts at the same time the special effects in the movie are dazzling just when we thought that we were so accustomed to the limitless wonders of cgi that we could never be stunned in a theater again spielberg just plain knocks our socks off my husband counted eight spontaneous oh my gods coming from me during the movie it isnt just that it all looks real seamlessly integrating the effects its that what looks so real is so oh my god the images are fresh and imaginative and yet perfectly believable mixing the normal with the inconceivable from the vast alien machines to the buckling of the earth and the apocalyptic landscapes the most vivid images are when we see the trappings of everyday life transformed in one moment of complete insanity the bells at a railroad crossing start to clang and the striped barriers come down as though it is a perfectly ordinary day and the commuter train is about to arrive on schedule everyone stops and takes a breath and then the train comes in filled with flames spielbergs other great trick is his mastery of scale and again that use of context brings the story literally home at least half of the oh my gods were responses to wowstyle reveals of new threats new invasions and spielberg makes invasion into a theme from the very beginning when with stunning economy he sets the stage for all that is to come our herotobe ray tom cruise arrives home late his exwife mary ann miranda otto pregnant by her new husband is standing there with a hand on her hip the new husband is handsome a little sleeklooking in a black turtleneck but clearly so nice you cant even bring yourself to hate him though ray has clearly tried even though the exwife is late she decides to carry their daughters suitcase into rays house ray is very uncomfortable as she opens his allbutempty refrigerator and peeks into his messy bedroom he feels invaded his children seem alien and yet in one of the most understated but meaningful moments in the movie a shared joke between ray and mary ann shows us a glimpse of rays asperity and resolve but all of that is under the surface when we meet him ray has long been used to disappointing people it is not clear which is worse the sullen animosity of his son robbie ray wears a yankees baseball cap robbie pulls out one with a red sox logo or the patient lack of expectations from his daughter rachel dakota fanning but when it becomes clear that something very very bad is happening ray will do anything to keep his family safe this will be his story more than it is the story of the battles the movie is at heart well heart and cruise does heart well he and fanning anchor the film with outstanding performances of conviction and charisma rachels protection of her space and rays efforts to care for her memory and spirit all echo the invasion theme the story moves well from the large scale destruction of a city to a smallscale intrusion into a shattered basement retreat occupied by three people throughout the focus is on spielbergs favorite subject the family as fortress the government barely exists the army is dedicated and honorable but overmatched and as ray points out the humans are almost as dangerous as the aliens ray is not the only one who will do anything to keep his family alive and the ochlochratic chaos means that nowhere is safe the story is affecting the action scenes are thrilling the issues are resonant yet it is not ultimately as satisfying as less skillful movies like independence day it may be wiser and it may have more artistic validity but summer explosion movies call out for a more complete resolution than the wells book allows a valid but subtle point is lost not for lack of respectful presentation but perhaps because ot it spoilers alert parents should know that this is an extremely tense and intense movie with constant peril and violence many characters are killed many are neatly vaporized but there are scenes with dead bodies a brutal offcamera murder a death by impalement guns grenades lasers and other weapons and some grisly images characters use brief strong language there are tense confrontations between family members some viewers will find the behavior of the humans more disturbing than that of the aliens someone once said that the aliens in movies tell us more about what we are thinking about than about any likely reallife extraterrestrials the ufo movies of the cold war era were under this analysis a reflection of our fears about communism and the atomic bomb  with the 1956 version of invasion of the body snatchers and the day the earth stood still as examples contrasted with the more benign aliens of spielbergs other movies what does this movie tell us about our current fears families who see this movie should talk about how the story has changed since it was originally written by hg wells more than 100 years ago how was that eras interest in the relatively recent scientific discoveries reflected in the book and how has the current version used modern concerns to connect to a contemporary audience what do you think about the balance of the story between the action and the personal drama as rays character has to become more responsible and find a way to communicate with his children how did both parts of the story help each other in a situation like this who do you help who do you accept help from families who appreciate this film may enjoy listening to the legendary orson welles broadcast this version of the book has the radio script as well the text is also available online at project gutenberg the new version has a small tribute to the george pal movie they will also enjoy independence day one of the alltime best alien invasion movies and they might get a kick out of battlefield earth one of the worst and signs one that has a bit of both for the first time after reading many many of your excellent reviews i finally saw a movie for which my review is quite different than yours i saw the movie today then looked up your review for the first time thinking youd probably have given it a d i was surprised to see how highly you rated it of course art is in the eye of the beholder and all are entitled to their perspectives pardon me for saying but i felt that this was one of the worst movies ive seen i think that tom cruise and dakota fanning are capable of good acting but i feel that the script for this movie was horrible to me the movie consisted mainly of aliens attack earth worst case scenario for 99 pct of the movie then 1 pct of dying alien seen in spacecraft before end of movie i felt there was little plot other than this and found myself fastforwarding through a lot of the mayhem  explosions wreckage vaporizing bodies i honestly would recommend that people not rent this movie i felt my time was wasted ive found steven spielberg to be a good director but inconsistent some of his movies have been great while others such as ai i felt were big duds there is something disconnected about both ai and wotw their storylines are weak and the characters in them are not as dynamic as characters in bettermade films in et and indiana jones 1 the characters are welldeveloped and dynamic by contrast characters in both ai and wotw seemed more unidimensional stanley kubrick managed to take themes of people dealing with disaster and make the characters come to life to a greater degree than spielberg makes them as brad bird of pixar is fond of saying special effects can only take a movie so far in the end it is the story that is the most important thanks very much brian  this is a movie i like less and less as i get further away from seeing it  you make some very good points and i will rethink my rating
May 27 2011,positive,an unstoppable juggernaut of action and anxiety that will have you blundering from the cinema in a state of nervous exhaustion dont expect any soft drink promotional tieins with this summer blockbuster
Mar 7 2011,positive,war of the worlds is that most rare of screen adaptations  a film that is faithful to its origins and at the same time its own separate creature the first half is better than the second but what a first half
Dec 17 2010,positive,alien invasion thriller too scary for young kids

May 19 2010,positive,in its own right it works well enough most of the time to pass an entertaining couple of hours
Apr 29 2009,positive,an exciting intense gruesome and awfully subversive piece of science fiction escapism
Oct 18 2008,positive,see it but lower your expectations
Feb 28 2008,negative,this is spielberg at his unabashedly commercial worst u2014 bland unimaginative and more interested in his bang than his brain
Jul 23 2007,positive, steven spielberg in the first hour or so of war of the worlds summons the apocalypse with all his genius for suspense and sadism yes sadism ive long felt that spielberg has a lot of anger to work off  its come out in the oddest ways in some of his films  and here he gets to kill most of us off via tripodriding aliens who squash millions of people as if they were less than ants knocking over buildings flinging cars in the air upending ferries zapping screaming humans into ash spielberg is make no mistake having the time of his life war of the worlds differs from a callow destructathon like independence day in that the largescale carnage with catastrophe building on catastrophe thrills as much as it hurts this is really the first whack spielberg has had at depicting mass destruction since 1941 over twentyfive years ago and he shows all the summermovie whippersnappers how its done when the aliens emerge from the cracked asphalt of new jersey and begin their brutal business you can safely strap in for some of the most aweinspiring work spielberg has done in years the rest of war of the worlds though is hit or miss the problems for some may begin with tom cruise as the films default hero  ray ferrier a divorced dad who never grew up spielbergs portfolio is full of men like ray and they were more believable when smallerscale actors like richard dreyfuss were playing them in close encounters of the third kind dreyfuss playing an equally childlike father gave off a schlumpy everyman vibe but with a manic gleam that kept you unsure what he was going to do certainly spielberg wouldnt find it in himself these days to give us a hero who leaves his wife and kids behind as dreyfuss did and tom cruise is not the sort of actor who makes you nervous in that way at least not in this kind of role cruise hurts the film because you dont buy for a minute that a summer movie starring tom cruise will end with him or his two kids dakota fanning and justin chatwin anywhere near dead a remake of war of the worlds directed by spielberg would have sold itself it didnt need star power and if spielberg had cast someone like paul giamatti  an actor who can play someone who might fail  the movie would be more successfully terrifying as it is were not sure why ray running with hundreds of others on the chaotic streets doesnt get zapped along with the dozens who get reduced to ash constantly on either side of him other than the fact that hes tom cruise as written and played ray has nothing much going for him aside from bulldog determination he has to protect his kids at all times and at all costs thwarted by one crisis or another sometimes its aliens sometimes its panicked mobs of people and you get the sense that hes being punished for being an absentee father millions of humans perish by fire so that ray the deadbeat dad can redeem himself through action  or actionmovie action apparently it wouldnt be a spielberg film these days without a stretch of film that makes little sense and could be deleted with no harm done and here we have ray and his little daughter holing up in a basement with a grimfaced survivalist played by tim robbins the climax of this plot thread serves no purpose other than to prove that ray will do anything to keep his daughter alive except that the proof is kept behind a closed door for robbins part playing a guntoting redneck he gives the sort of crude performance  to paraphrase pauline kael  only a very dedicated liberal would give his character is bad news the second we lay eyes on him because hes rural and hes armed spielberg and robbins are both capable of more subtlety than this some viewers have been bothered by the films wealth of 911inspired imagery  the missingperson posters the flakes of ash that used to be flesh falling everywhere spielberg gets a pass there  911 showed us all what real disaster looks like and it would be disingenuous of the movie to go back to the relatively clean zapzap of something like independence day or for that matter the original 1953 war of the worlds if the destruction is unavoidably exciting the aftermath is by necessity sobering and chilling a director can be of two minds about the carnage he wreaks  we saw it in the famous ride of the valkyries helicopterattack sequence in francis coppolas apocalypse now equal parts invigorating and appalling spielberg following hg wells book eschews the id4 formula of aliens attack we hit back the power of our military is shown to be haplessly meaningless against the wellshielded aliens the aliens downfall as relevant today as in wells day is simply the arrogance of dominion too confident in their ability to wipe out big foes they dont account for smaller ones in the end this war of the worlds plays on american fears much the same way earlier versions of the story including orson welles notorious 1938 radio hoax did  in this case terrorism with a side order of unease about the way things are going in iraq talk about the arrogance of dominion if anyone finds it implausible that aliens would invade a planet they know fatally little about how about a country that starts a war on bullshit pretenses with an insufficient number of troops and threadbare equipment hoping that the people will greet us as liberators we have met the aliens and they are us its fun to analyze summer entertainment this way if not terribly satisfying it doesnt make the movie larger than it is i still prefer tim burtons flamboyantly goofy mars attacks which had no agenda other than to blow stuff up for fun spielberg blows stuff up better than anyone  he proves himself the maestro of that bynowdegraded game but he does it so well that its a hard act for even the maestro to follow
Jul 14 2007,neutral,just when it seemed like mr spielberg might be maturing into a filmmaker with some muchneeded cynicism you realize hes still just out there rounding up the dollars
Jun 27 2007,positive,spielberg flips the et script with this scifi flick which reverts to the pulp fiction notion of aliens as the enemies of earthlings
Jun 8 2007,negative,spielbergs calculations turn out to be more prominent than any effects they could possibly produce and the less pretentious 1953 version by producer george pal emerges as more likable
Feb 26 2007,positive,reconfirms spielberg as a master of action here seamlessly integrating spectacular visual magic into the most mundane and familiar settings
Nov 17 2006,positive,like disasters in real life the film hits you in the gut with a vision of catastrophe and leaves you to sort out what it all means
Oct 30 2006,positive, one of the more solidly crafted science fiction films in a while war of the worlds is about as far from quintessential nice steven spielberg as you can get  which is why that makes this one of his better mainstream entertainment vehicles since jurassic park taking the hg wells original story and following it more closely than expected from the tripod designs to the all too rushed and almost anticlimactic deus ex machina ending spielberg creates an alien invasion movie that can be labelled the antithesis to the likes of independence day or the ilk the reason the personal perspective rather than showing off the bigger focus of said invasion and the power players youd see in the likes of these movies world leaders leading scientists etc this stays purely locked on one disjointed family after a quiet ten minute introduction which plays out like your average family drama  in this case a pissed off divorcee dad finds his kids a hassle whilst they simply resent him  the film kicks into gear theres two scenes involving conversations in two different basements that run for about five minutes each other than that this is essentially one nonstop action sequence that never lets up even those two quiet scenes are followed by two of the films best scenes the first of which made me shudder from its impact  something i cant recall doing in a movie in years war is an example of what both true science fiction not that lucas swashbuckling fantasy kiddie stuff and the bmovie genre can achieve koepps script has practically no plot short of some large broad strokes character development is both minimal and predictable various sequences do feel derivative and repetitive yet its enthralling and cleverly lays out its beats perfectly almost never letting its pace drop and never falling into traps theres no attempts at humour patriotic speeches pontificating or politics the dialogue practically never sounds too cheesy aside from tim robbins the one weak character in the film indeed i looked for it but the words alien or martian never appear its simply them or they come from elsewhere as much as i enjoyed revenge of the sith and loved batman begins this summer both have some big flaws relating to their ambitious scripts which reached further than their writers could live up to  the result was some hokey dialogue or moments which didnt feel right koepps script on the whole isnt as well conceived or grand but by keeping the focus tight and personal he avoids some of the pitfalls theres one or two creaky points such as the convenient newsvan scene which serves as exposition central although its gotten over with quickly thank god or the somewhat ridiculous second last ending but koepp for the most part keeps our knowledge of events limited to what our main trio know the lack of character development wont be seen as a good thing by some even if the film uses that to its advantage by never having these characters break out into unrealistic monologues spilling out background information its a simple no frills cautionary tale thats smartly told no more or less make no mistake though this is not a happy blockbuster  war of the worlds is a bleak and desolate movie in a hardcore unrelenting way in fact saving private ryan with the exception of its opening 20 minutes is in many ways a nicer spielberg film than this its not an rrated film but pushes damn close to that boundary and is more shocking than some with the stricter rating such as the last few minutes set within robbins basement which involves both a brutal act and a hideous revelation about the somewhat mishandled red weed element even quieter scenes ranging from dakotas shocking discovery whilst taking a piss to little moments of people caught in collateral damage cause chills performances are strong all across the board too for the first time in ages tom cruise seemed to be playing someone other than tom cruise despite all the hype and somewhat ingratiating public appearances lately which havent exactly been beneficial to his public profile seeing him in action on screen again you realise the guy is a solid actor in a role thats almost purely reactionary in tone and could be seen as somewhat hokey in other hands cruise brings a necessary gravitas kudos should go out to all the supporting cast too  fanning finally seemed to be playing someone her age albeit still too smart chatwin makes a rebellious teen character actually sympathetic even ottos tiny screen time brings some of the films few smiles like i said the only bum note is robbins not because of the actor mind you but more the character whilst spielbergs film liberally borrows elements from plenty of other scifi great films one wonders why he had to import the stereotypical gun nut style character with his incessant whinging  maybe to act as counterpoint to cruise if so he couldve done a lot better up until that point in the film this had been a pure action movie from then on it changes tone to become something darker and more suspenseoriented its also when the film changes from cruise and company being merely reactive to somewhat proactive including a rather stupid bit involving cages and an alien orifice thatll make me avoid getting close to female genitalia ever again the end solution falls along the lines of wells tale which seems almost anachronistic and all too much of a cop out that will leave modern crowds with a somewhat sinking feeling the look of the film is superb from the ilm effects which are far better and less cartoonish than theyve been in a while to the superb designs of the tripods  the only bum note are the aliens themselves which seem like an id4carebear hybrid the disintegration beams are beautifully handled especially with their after effect which renders one scene in the film to look like something out of a calvin klein commercial spielberg also tries his hand at being robert trick shot zemeckis with a single shot take revolving in and around a moving van not only is the shot good its actually used for one of the films best quieter moments involving dakota working out her personal space theres various laughable continuity errors from the somewhat selective effects of the emp to the way it seems the roads are magically clear for driving a car through but these are pure nitpicks at best and dont retract from the film at all really so what are the real flaws by retaining such a simple premise the film does tread over itself  more than once our trio of family heroes escape death or injury quite conveniently scenes of mass panic and hysteria are done convincingly but are hardly new i love the basement roving eye sequence but it feels very abyss water tentacleish i enjoyed the disgusting display of human selfishness in the scene with people scrambling to get into the car  even though i saw the same scene in day of the triffids over a decade ago various shots and sequences borrow from the best of the genre and despite its well told edge theres an almost cold distancing effect the film generates though its hard to tell if thats deliberate or not at times it desperately tries to become something more by squeezing in bits of subtext about various issues ranging from parental to paranoia those moments feel forced into what is essentially a streamlined and pure entertainment vehicle theres been a surprising amount of above average mainstream films this season which seem to just keep getting better on a technical and visceral level though worlds can fairly be called one of the best summer films so far its the spielberg of old simple but smart entertainment itll be loved by his fans but its far from perfect and the coldness and brutality undermined in the worst possible way by the cheesily happy ending will stop it from being remembered or rewatched in the same way his far superior crowd pleasing efforts like raiders or jaws are its a b movie but if you can get over the few but fatal shortcomings it has  what a b movie
Oct 29 2006,neutral,the film is dark and bleak with little real sense of wonderthe thing that should be spielbergs forte

Nov 11 2005,positive,spielbergs worlds is filled with terrific scenes but ultimately he draws the film to a predictable and utterly disappointing conclusion
Oct 27 2005,negative,a basic rule of thumb is  if you see tim robbins youve stayed too long
Sep 26 2005,positive,there likely wont be a more gripping film this year than spielbergs war of the worlds which at its best glides along like choreography with a camera slowly parsing out information while shrouding the rest in shadow and suggestion
Aug 2 2005,positive,certainly a grabbag of spielbergs greatest hits but like the beatles theres a reason a lot of those hits were 1 when they came out
Aug 2 2005,positive,as much a disaster movie as it is a straight scifi horror film  there are very good performances in the film  but the movie leaves you feeling letdown and quarrelsome
Jul 25 2005,positive,i liked it a lot aside from the ending which made me want to burn down the theater
Jul 22 2005,positive,just as jaws made us fear the water wotw makes us wary of the weather youll never again look at lightning in quite the same way
Jul 22 2005,positive,an adrenaline pumping disaster movie told within the context of a small scale family drama  is an entertaining thrill ride
Jul 21 2005,positive,all summer blockbusters should be as loud and scary  and deliver  like this
Jul 19 2005,positive,until its final act the film is lean and alive a visceral thrill ride designed to move audiences to the edge of their seats or maybe into their parents laps
Jul 18 2005,positive,war of the worlds shows that steven spielberg remains one of the best shooters in hollywood
Jul 17 2005,negative,the narrative miscalculation is extraordinary and ruinous to the extent that i cant conjure an example of a similarly enjoyable movie being beheaded so efficiently
Jul 15 2005,positive,war of the worlds is thoughtful but dont let that worry you this is an action film concerned more with delivering thrills than making bold statements
Jul 14 2005,positive,wotw is a great film and entertainment that can be taken seriously shyamalan and emmerich must be quietly shaking their fists realizing he still does it better
Jul 14 2005,negative,overall the film is too lacking in feeling to provide a recognizably human experience
Jul 14 2005,positive,the movie is the antiindependence day the aliens are kicking our butts and we cant do anything but wait for our turn to become kibble
Jul 13 2005,positive,its worth every penny
Jul 13 2005,positive, the visual effects are impressive and the crew does a technically competent job the heart and warmth weve come to expect from spielberg is missing  didnt i already see this in 1996 and wasnt it called independence day im only halfjoking actually this movie is better than the aforementioned schlockfest but to my surprise it wasnt all that much better i havent read the book by hg wells on which this movie and its previous incarnations were based but after seeing this latest remake i really want to read the book i suspect ill enjoy it more than i enjoyed this movie   before i really delve into the review i want to lament the loss of the old steven spielberg the one who gave us such classics as the goonies the indiana jones series and of course et i remember watching ai a few years ago and expressing surprise at how bad it was i still feel that way but despite that what really permeates throughout ai is a high dose of sentimentality and yes even some warmth at times but since then spielberg movies have been almost entirely devoid of warmth i thought minority report was a decent movie but it had almost no warmth at all even schindlers list had some warmth to it at times but war of the worlds is almost completely devoid of the heart and warmth we have come to expect from spielbergs movies vic wrote an article about spielbergs changing directorial style here of course spielberg is free to do as he chooses but he would do well to remember why he became one of the most successful directors in hollywood   tom cruise plays ray ferrier a dock worker in new york city hes cocky and has a chip on his shoulder sound familiar hes also divorced with two kids and hes not much of a father to them his son robbie played by justin chatwin basically wont even speak to him and his daughter rachel played by dakota fanning is growing more estranged from him every day rays exwife mary ann played by miranda otto has married a rich guy named tim played by david alan basche which only adds to the stress a workingclass guy like ray must feel long story short this family puts the fun in dysfunctional   not long after mary ann drops the kids off at rays house for a visit strange things start happening the sky becomes very overcast and a fierce wind starts blowing towards a big hole in the sky shortly after that a series of lightning knocks out pretty much anything electrical in the area except a few choice objects of the filmmakers choosing  bah wanting to find out what happened ray heads down to where the lightning struck as it turns out all the lightning bolts hit the same location causing a big crater in the road the crowd gathering around the crater doesnt have to wait long to see some action though because a huge alien vessel with three legs henceforth called a tripod pops out of the ground despite their fear at the fact that several city blocks have already been destroyed the crowds mentality is still one of curiosity at least until the tripod starts shooting a laser beam at everyone in sight instantly cremating them but not their clothes oddly enough ray immediately hightails it back home just barely avoiding the laser beams on several occasions he quickly has his kids pack whatever they can and since ray knows where a working vehicle can be found of course they head for boston to find mary ann and tim   of course as you might guess the trip to boston doesnt go exactly as planned and they end up losing the vehicle because when you have the only working vehicle in new york city people tend to get a little envious they end up trying other methods to reach their destination primarily walking and the ferry all of which put them in harms way because it turns out that there are quite a few tripods in quite a few locations throughout earth the vast majority of the movie features ray and his kids trying to avoid being killed by the aliens there are a few scenes where they hide out but most of the time they are running for their lives there are so many questions throughout this movie will ray and his kids survive will humanity be able to defeat the powerful aliens and will it somehow involve ray will the audience groan in disbelief at an ending that feels like it was pulled right out of thin air   the technical aspects of this film are very well done the special effects are great and most of the actors did fine jobs i didnt really like dakota fannings portrayal of rachel it seemed like half the time she was wise beyond her years while the other half she was screaming her head off im certainly no expert on what a tenyearold should act like but somehow i thought it should be more consistent its not all dakota fannings fault primarily because many of her mannerisms were scriptdriven tom cruise does an admirable job of acting you can always tell he works hard and i see that as a good thing he also does a good job of integrating oneliners into his scenes without making them seem cheesy or out of place   so is the movie worth seeing that depends on what youre expecting if youre expecting to walk out of the theater with a big grin on your face while shouting that was awesome this movie wont fit the bill its too dark somewhat depressing and very bloody and violent the pg13 rating is welldeserved so please do the little ones a favor and leave them at home if youre after great special effects and a high adrenaline rush and you dont mind the fact that the storyline takes a back seat by all means go and see it to be honest this movie is better than most of the dreck coming out of hollywood these days the only problem is considering the high caliber of talent behind the camera and in front of it i was expecting quite a bit more  obiwan kenobi is a character with many different abilities both in star wars canon and in legends however not all of these powers are canon dune 2s ending delivers an epic conclusion to this chapter of paul atreides story as the sequel also teases what is next for the scifi franchise
Jul 12 2005,negative, a visual and technical achievement but underwhelming on every other level
Jul 10 2005,negative,it doesnt work as a science fiction epic it doesnt work as a tale of families bonding in the face of tragedy and it certainly doesnt work as a mingling of the two
Jul 8 2005,positive,you dont think a walking tripod can be scary
Jul 8 2005,positive,dont expect reeses pieces or mashed potatoes to be on the menu in spielbergs shockandawesome version of wells
Jul 8 2005,positive,a summer spectacular in which human relationships and emotions refuse to be overwhelmed by admittedly awesome computergenerated mayhem
Jul 7 2005,positive,its a thrilling ridebut this bountiful pot of signifiers leaves a caustic aftertaste
Jul 7 2005,positive,a thrilling but frivolous ride
Jul 7 2005,positive,war of the worlds is taut gripping and surprisingly dark filmmaking
Jul 7 2005,negative,a rather primitive demolition derby with little of the human solidarity that was corny but meaningful in the 1953 picture
Jul 7 2005,positive,hg wells wouldnt recognize his 1898 alieninvasion novel the war of the worlds in steven spielbergs updated film version but wells could probably relate to the ensuing fear and panic
Jul 7 2005,negative,theres stuff to make you go wow but nothing youll remember the next day
Jul 7 2005,positive,this was one really intense terrifying film that must be seen on the big screen
Jul 7 2005,positive,i just thought it was unrealistic when they killed the aliens with a chemical imbalance because we all know theres no such thing as a chemical imbalance
Jul 7 2005,positive,spielberg remains the consummate storyteller even if the material he has chosen to work with simply doesnt pack the emotional wallop of a schindlers list
Jul 7 2005,positive,an impressive display of sound and fury that falls apart the minute any scrutiny is applied to the machinations of its plot
Jul 7 2005,positive,war what is it good for absolutely nothing but a good couple of hours at the theater
Jul 6 2005,negative, in the wake of all tom cruises  lets say idiosyncratic antics to prove to the world that hes just dippy about katie holmes and therefore simply cannot be gay what is one to make of a couple early moments in his new opus war of the worlds first his boss asks him whats your problem anyway to this cruise responds i know a couple of women who could tell you do you suppose their names are mimi and nicole a few minutes later the movie cuts to a tv screen with the recently outed cartoon character spongebob squarepants on it announcing ive got a secret its kind of hard to believe these things are coincidental but why are they here what do they mean is mr spielberg having a bit of fun at his stars expense  im sure i dont know but in a lot of ways its more interesting to ponder than the bulk of this generally respectable but far from inspired latest version of the hg wells novel  no its not a bad movie  well at least up until the last few minutes when it becomes not just a bad movie but a laughably bad one  but its rarely more than an efficient one thats not helped by being spielbergized  the decision to update wells 1898 novel to the present day isnt really the problem the story successfully survived this change when orson welles did his famous radio version in 1938 and more or less successfully survived it when byron haskin turned into a movie in 1953 spielberg in fact has said that he wants the film to have the same impact as the radio show and pays slight homage to the earlier movie by affording cameos for its stars gene barry and ann robinson in his new version  just how he planned to duplicate the impact of the welles version is open to question since the public reaction to welles legendary panic broadcast is difficult enough to fathom stemming from listeners who tuned in late or were simply so credulous they mistook the dramatization for an actual news broadcast of a martian invasion presumably he thought that the prewar jitters of 1938 that might have fueled the original reaction would find their modern counterpart in fears of terrorist attacks the film certainly goes out of its way to incorporate references to terrorists but since this follows morgan freeman inheriting the profound mantle of narrator from sir cedric hardwicke in the 1953 film on the soundtrack assuring us that the bad guys are from another planet the idea only works as a conscious reference to the present day  in any case what hurts the film is spielbergs dogged insistence on turning it into yet another of his seemingly endless middlebrow meditations on the travails of the middleclass family casting aging uberyuppie tom cruise as stevedore ray ferrier is pretty farfetched to begin with but the movie comes complete with a separate problem centering its story on negligent father ray and his rebellious 22 year old teenage son robbie justin chatwin taking lives and precocious daughter rachel precocious dakota fanning may achieve the desired effect of communicating the terror felt by characters who barely understand whats going on but it removes any scientific underpinnings and creates a huge huh factor for the viewer not familiar with the novel  is it easier to identify with a rather unlikable stevedore and his appalling children than with the traditional pipesmoking scientist possibly still it might have been helpful if thered been somebody around to explain the red vegetation that creeps over the landscape or postulate a bit about how any of the invaders various devices work  even setting this aside the whole familydrama aspect of the film is not only spielberg 101 at its simplest its remarkably beside the point and distracting since almost no one else  other than tim robbins as a kind of survivalist loon  is given any kind of a character the mass destruction is so impersonal that its more spectacle than grim tragedy moreover the three characters we do get are just not very likable rays supposed growth from negligent papa to doting dad  with time out for a few minutes of actionhero stuff  isnt terrifically believable or involving robbie is so truculent and pigheaded that hes impossible to like and rachel quickly goes from fannings standard pintsized bette davis precocity to terrified 10yearold screaming every five minutes is just annoying  none of this is terribly surprising coming from spielberg but it is a surprise finding spielberg shamelessly copying not only himself but others here it starts out early with scenes glimpsed as reflections in a tv set signs and is soon extended to the tripod war machines sporting a design that borrows from the shape of the monsters head in alien and the war machines incomprehensibly possessing an apparent organic sphincterlike opening thats straight out of evolution of all things a sequence where human beings are captured and stowed away in cages on the underside of the war machines looks and feel like a holdover from ai  theres just something more than a little tired about all this but the worst of the film is the preposterous ending no im not in reference to the plot device thats right out of wells novel but the whole family resolution which is worse than merely absurd it gives off the distinct sense that its ok to destroy 99 percent of the world so long as it heals rays fractured family  all this to one side  and its a lot  there are undeniable moments of raw power in the film the war machines are impressive enough and executed with some of the most convincing cgi jiggerypokery yet to hit the screen the scenes of destruction are certainly impressive and theyre occasionally creepy  especially the river of corpses  and blessedly spielberg keeps the film under two hours  the question is whether these are sufficient reasons to see the film and im not sure they are yes the movie is an adequate realization of its source novel and it generates a certain tension but its also far from being the masterpiece its supposed to be for folks who enjoy expertly crafted scenes of mass destruction its a mustsee for anyone else its apt to fall short rated pg13 for frightening sequences of scifi violence and disturbing images the comments section

Jul 6 2005,positive,whether it represents filmmaking at its most opportunistic or most empathic will be up to each viewer to decide but theres no denying its potency as a harrowing thrill ride
Jul 6 2005,positive,imagine jurassic park handled with the sorrow and doom of schindlers list its the most terrifying movie in ages
Jul 6 2005,positive,bewildered mildly optimistic holding out the hope of salvation in spite of everything in a blasted empty landscape war of the world is in the end and perhaps despite its intentions a fairly tentative assertion of hope for the future
Jul 5 2005,positive,surprisingly dark for a blockbuster and delivers handsomely in terms of thrills and special effects
Jul 5 2005,positive, spielbergs adaptation of hg wells classic scifi novel is in its own way a model of the form and a worthy successor to both orson welles panicinducing 1939 radio broadcast and george pal and byron haskins beloved 1953 technicolor eyecandy version cruise plays ray ferrier a divorced new york city metalworker who finds himself saddled one weekend with not only his two kids robbie chatwin and rachel fanning but also with the imminent destruction of mankind via alien invasion for poor ray its going to be one of those weekends cruise is playing against type dialing down that cocksure megawatt grin in favor of making ray as the film begins an unsympathetic jerk more interested in rebuilding car engines theres one hogging space in his kitchen than spending quality time with his offspring when a freak lightning storm knocks out the power and opens up a crater in the middle of main street ray witnesses the arrival of an alien machine  the tripod  birthing its way up from beneath his very feet from here on out war of the worlds is one lengthy but always gripping chase film as the massive alien tripods stalk hapless humans over hill and dale blasting them into ash with vicious serpentine ease while the military runs afoul of their seemingly invincible shields its spielbergs best and truest action film since jaws relentlessly paced pitchperfectly acted the young fanning is almost certain to get a best supporting actress nod come oscar time and rife with moments of such horrifically poetic imagery that its all you can do not to stop thinking about them long after the film has ended spielberg and the gang at industrial light  magic have knocked the ball not only out of the park but out of earths orbit as well the first appearance of the alien tripods is as breathtakingly awesome  in the truest sense of the word mind you  as anything yet put on film and thats only in the films first 20 minutes as ray and his kids commandeer the only working vehicle in town and light out for boston with the aim of finding the kids mother they run up against wave after wave of human refugees panicked and herded by the towering alien craft like so much cattle to the slaughter and slaughter it is theres precious little outright gore in this hard pg13 film but one of the films most nightmarishly lyrical moments recalls both the awful first seconds after the impacts on the world trade center towers without so much as a drop of the red stuff the metaphor for terrorist attack is so front and center it hardly bears mentioning war of the worlds is pure popcorn escapism of the highest order if you want it to be or more but its never less than thrilling thanks in enormous part to the films magnificent sternumrattling sound design surely another of the films oscarcalibrated achievements faithful to wells novel in ways the 1953 version was not the films script by david koepp and josh friedman sports more than a few plot holes for one the electricity outage seems might selective and an ending faithful to wells original it should be noted that feels just a tad too abrupt but thats no reason to ignore what is certainly one of the most lovingly crafted endoftheworld cinematic feasts ever made a spectacle of destruction and survival not even cb demille could have envisioned a note to readers bold and uncensored the austin chronicle has been austins independent news source for over 40 years expressing the communitys political and environmental concerns and supporting its active cultural scene now more than ever we need your support to continue supplying austin with independent free press if real news is important to you please consider making a donation of 5 10 or whatever you can afford to help keep our journalism on stands
Jul 5 2005,positive, in a seemingly benign yet ultimately ominous line of dialogue early in steven spielbergs war of the worlds the exwife of ray ferrier tom cruise a new jersey dock worker and charmingly deadbeat dad says to him after dropping off their two kids for the weekend take care of our children at the time she says it she has no idea that the world as they know it is on the brink of utter destruction and that her admonition to ray will soon take on a dimension previously unimaginable its a perfect moment of irony reminding us that the worst always happens when we least expect it the worst in this case is an alien invasion one that has been planned for millions of years because the enormous tripod alien machines used to eviscerate anything and everything in their paths dont come from the skies but rather emerge from deep beneath the ground where they were buried long ago the alien craft have a retro quality in that they conform to the descriptions and illustrations of hg wells victorianera source novel but rather than detracting from the movies modern setting this retroness adds to their displaced uncanniness the spindly legs on which they stand give them a snaky insectlike quality that makes them more monstrous than mechanical in war of the worlds spielberg has crafted a genuinely traumatic summer event movie one that gives us images of violence and destruction of often devastating emotional weight not since ai artificial intelligence 2001 has he used a movie to cut so close to the bone and while war of the worlds lacks that movies emotionalthematic resonance it is nonetheless the most gripping and accomplished work hes done in years as a rebuke to his previous alien movies close encounters of the third kind 1977 and et 1982 war of the worlds is at times shocking yet it fits well with spielbergs increasingly dark cinematic worldview which has been slowly saturating his output ever since he made schindlers list in 1993 in a way its like hes never been able to shake the holocaust and despite his constant attempts to tack on upbeat endings his films from the past 10 years have been increasingly preoccupied with loss trauma and suffering in ways that even the sunniest of endings cant recuperate trauma is the operative word in war of the worlds which bears the distinct stamp of 911 in virtually every respect it is not so much that catastrophic destruction on the big screen immediately brings to mind the televisual images of the twin towers coming down but that spielberg actively engages in associating the events in his scifi spectacle with the traumatic memories from four years earlier the shattered flaming remains of a downed airplane with bodies still strapped into the seats tearyeyed family members posting signs with the pictures of missing loved ones and a major character covered in the chalky gray dust of eviscerated bodies are just a few of the movies most strikingly associative images and when people scream in the movie it doesnt have the canned cadence of hundreds of extras responding to instructions through a bullhorn but rather a real sense of panicked terror the idea of the tripods being buried in the groundessentially planted in our midst awaiting the right moment to strikeevokes the everpresent fears stoked by post911 stories about the hijackers of terrorists moving among us we fear invasion but more than anything we fear invasion from within our own midsts  of course this shouldnt come as too much of a surprise in each of its major incarnations war of the worlds has born the weight of the times it was originally written as a serialized novel in 1898 by the pessimistic scifi master hg wells whose fears of modernization gave the story of martian invaders a prescient kick when it was brought to life as a famously panicinducing radio show by orson welless mercury theater in 1938 it was cast in the eerie light of a world on the brink of war and when it was made into a groundbreaking event movie by george pal in 1953 it became a perfect example of cold war paranoia and fears about a red invasion all of those versions of the story took a wide view of the events so one of the main differences in the new movie is that screenwriters josh friedman and david koepp restrict our view of whats happening to the realm of three people ray ferrier and his two children his angry 15yearold son robbie justin chatwin and his precocious 10yearold daughter rachel dakota fanning this eliminates many of the clich√©s associated with alieninvasion stories and other movies that rely on the spectacle of mass destruction particularly the images of major monuments being destroyed instead much of the largescale violence is seen only in fragmented form often through a partially obscured window or reflected in a rearview mirror spielberg doesnt scrimp on the special effectsdeep inside he knows theyre the films bread and butterbut he recasts the fxheavy destruction from an individual point of view which is what gives it emotional weight he is also deeply cognizant of aftermath and many of the movies most striking borderline horrific images are not of the carnage in action but the eerily quiet moments after such as a river choked with corpses and a nightmarish walk through a forest at night while empty clothing rains down from above spielberg has always been hailed or criticized as a filmmaker deeply in touch with our collective inner child and it is possibly for this reason that he is also so good at tapping into the kinds of childlike fears that we never really grow out of but simply learn to cope with throughout spielbergs films children have often borne the brunt of violence think of the indian child slaves in indiana jones and the temple of doom or carol anne being abducted by ghosts in poltergeist and it is no different here dakota fannings rachel gets the worst of it throughout war of the worlds simply because she is a child she doesnt necessarily go through anything worse than the other characters but her youth makes her experience that much worse it is telling that ray spends as much of the movie trying to protect her psychologically as he does physically at one point covering her eyes with a blindfoldnot to protect her from witnessing alieninflicted violence but rather some of his own while most of the carnage in war of the worlds is the work of the invaders spielberg doesnt turn a blind eye to how such catastrophe brings out both the best and the worst in people in terms of the former the movie is clearly intent on redeeming ray as a father figure showing that despite his lousiness as a dad in everyday life his paternal instinct to protect his children maintains a natural sharpness it is interesting in this respect to see cruise playing the character since he has so often played ambitious young men acting out against their missing father figures  rays hardscrabble heroism it is never in any sense superhuman constantly runs up against the actions of other people who are behaving just as he isin the interest of selfpreservationbut with a sometimes crueler read more desperate edge the movies most disturbing sequence doesnt involve aliens at all but rather a mob of people who tear ray and his family from the minivan in which theyre driving one of the only working cars around as ray and his children stumble into a nearby diner we see through the window behind them strangers shooting each other to get control of the van which is the breaking point for ray causing him to openly weep in front of those for whom he is trying to be strong all of this suggests that war of the worlds is not your typical summer event movie if anyone other than spielberg had directed it and if anyone other than cruise were starring in the lead role studio executives would have surely demanded that it be given a lighter tone with more emphasis on heroism and salvation than death and destruction one wonders if the films final scenes which attempt to offer a suggestion of hope and even go so far as to almost literally resurrect a character from death werent the product of a committee meeting to dampen the films otherwise bleak vision of annihilation perhaps so but it is hardly enough to dispel much less completely remove the aftertaste of spielbergs imagery which despite its fantastical origins is some of the most powerful of his career james kendrick offers exclusively on qnetwork over 2500 reviews on a wide range of films all films have a star rating and you can search in a variety

Jul 5 2005,negative,if youve seen independence day then youve seen war of the worlds
Jul 5 2005,positive,as it is i admire the brilliance of the majority of this picture to noend its just that pesky literal ending i walked out wanting to declare war on
Jul 5 2005,positive, a friend of mine has a young baby who could affectionately be classed as a screamer thus far the only foolproof method of placating her is to turn on the soothing tones of the narrator from jeff waynes war of the worlds ill be advising him at the earliest opportunity that if he ever wants the child to sleep again he should on no account consider steven spielbergs war of the worlds as a future companion piece for her because this is truly the stuff of nightmares a primal horror of such ferocity that not even richard burton will be able to calm you down after it   freely adapted from the novel by hg wells for the first fifteen or so minutes its a domestic drama as blue collar worker ray ferrier cruise struggles with the task of looking after his two children fanning and chatwin for the weekend while his exwife otto goes to boston with her new husband ray is not a good father as evidenced by his empty fridge and dubious methods of interacting with his kids fortunately for him the end of the world intervenes and saves him from what could have been a really tough couple of days   news reports have been telling of freak electrical storms around the globe and when the lightning hits the ferriers neighbourhood what begins as a cool light show quickly turns into something infinitely more dangerous as the streets crack apart and buildings crumble the source of all this devastation reveal themselves from deep beneath the ground  giant mechanical tripods that begin disintegrating everyone and everything in sight barely managing to get out of town alive ray and his family flee cross country desperately trying to evade their attackers constant onslaught while clinging to the slim hope of safety   no one would have believed in the first years of the 21st century that two of cinemas foremost exponents of summer entertainment would have come together again and fashioned something as unrelentingly grim as war of the worlds merciless in its intensity uncompromising in its brutality this film will rock you to your core this is not invasion its apocalypse the first scenes of alien rampage set the tone as thousands of people are mown down without regard or pity and the film continues in the same vein throughout alternating scenes of massacre with blind hysteria and moments of quiet reflection and sorrow   spielberg throws in many a nod to his own back catalogue  the raptor kitchen hunt from jurassic park is recreated as an unbearably tense game of alien hide and seek that embarrasses shyamalans risible signs the handheld confusion and immediacy of saving private ryan is recalled in the scenes of destruction that bring a new realism to cgi not that the special effects are the ultimate barometer of the quality of war of the worlds but as it happens theyre simply astonishing and yet spielberg doesnt draw attention to them often preferring to use an eye popping event in the background to accentuate the human misery being played out in front of it   the focus of this remains squarely on the ferriers with little or no indication given to events throughout the world this puts a lot of pressure on the cast and they step up admirably tom cruise remains an inexplicably underrated actor and his work here is amongst his best ever from his early scenes as a deadbeat weekend father through his transformation into a reluctant hero whether struggling to hold his emotions in check for the sake of the kids or giving his all to protect them he completely convinces and what else is there to be said about the frighteningly talented moppet that is dakota fanning in the last year alone shes more than held her own against big denzel and now wee tom not to mention carving a few slices off the honey roasted rump of de niro   war of the worlds is a terrifying potential vision of our own self inflicted doomsday masquerading as a summer blockbuster and if after an hour and three quarters of total carnage the resolution seems a little on the easy side im afraid theres no one to blame for that but mr wells
Jul 5 2005,positive,an intense sci fi experience that should satisfy viewers who crave both expensive special effects and intimate human drama assuming that such an audience exists
Jul 5 2005,negative,its as if the aliens landed and everyone died so that tom cruise could grow up one more time

Jul 5 2005,positive,  lightning storms herald the arrival of alien monsters in spielbergs refreshingly dark and brutal remix of h g wells scifi classic the war of the worlds there is no independence day bombast here everything is told through the eyes of ray ferrier tom cruise an ordinary man whose only concern is the safety of his children dakota fanning and justin chatwin as the world around them is engulfed in flames survival may be the best they can hope for  there are three steven spielbergs first up is warm fuzzy stevie who makes lifeaffirming slush like the terminal then theres serious steven who makes worthy films about important issues and finally you have psycho steve who just wants to creep up behind you and yell boo psycho steve is the guy who made jaws jurassic park the best bits of minority report and yes  war of the worlds the story may be scifi but the product is a horror film plain and simple a brilliantly constructed scaring machine  cruise is on fiery form exploiting the sharky side of his personality to expose rays frailties and hes well matched by fannings panicking child in a performance so genuinely traumatised that its uncomfortable to watch the only bum note is sounded by tim robbins hamming it up dreadfully as a schnappspickled survivalist  beginning as an alien reworking of saving private ryan and quickly evolving into a feast of stunning imagery ripped straight from a nightmare wotw astounds alarms and grips you like a beartrap psycho steve is back hold on to your popcorn
Jul 5 2005,positive,war of the worlds ends too abruptly running out of juice just as the aliens do even on summer popcorn terms its a tepid finish to a movie that for its first hour or so taps so expertly into our fears
Jul 5 2005,positive,the real strength of the film is how closely spielberg welds it to ray and his family
Jul 5 2005,positive,a greatesthits package from our greatest living entertainer there is almost overmuch to admire here but only the moments that aspire to post911 relevance chill as well as thrill
Jul 5 2005,positive,steven spielberg has delivered the blockbuster of the summer a stunning scifi spectacular thatll blow you away yes i know im gushing but war of the worlds really is that good
Jul 5 2005,positive, ray ferrier tom cruise is a working class slob estranged from his family and too wrapped up in himself his selfinvolvement will soon take a back seat when alien beings invade the earth and threaten to annihilate mankind in steven spielbergs making of the hg wells classic tale war of the worlds shes my little deuce coupe you dont know what i got little deuce coupe the beach boys ray ferrier tom cruise is taking care of his wary kids robbie justin chatwin taking lives and rachel dakota fanning hide  seek in his home beneath newarks casciano bridge while his exwife miranda otto the lord of the rings and her new husband visit her parents in boston rachel becomes increasingly terrified of what at first appears to be a particularly violent electrical storm but when ray sets out to investigate he is shocked to find himself in the midst of a war of the worlds switching the focus from gene barrys scientist of the 1953 edition to a single guy taking a crash course in familial love and responsibility steven spielberg creates a visceral thrill ride for the first twothirds of his film before losing steam and wrapping with an ending as ludicrously implausible as last years airheaded the day after tomorrow spielberg fans will recognize recycling from several of his earlier movies but they all serve their purpose in this loving amalgamation of todays technology with retro images from the directors childhood rays a cocky blue collar guy who works on the docks and stocks his kitchen with car parts his rocky role as a dad is underscored immediately and often when he shows up a half hour late to meet his ex at his house his teenaged son can barely be bothered to greet him and rays attempt to toss the ball around out back turns into a hostile contest after sleeping off his third shift ray awakens to discover that robbie who does not yet have his license has taken off in rays car meanwhile ignored television news reports of strange blackouts and earthquakes in other parts of the world play out in the background shades of shyamalans signs after that horrific lightning display mostly suggested via a terrific use of sound robbie returns to tell dad he watched the same spot get hit countless times ray proceeds to the intersection of van buren where he witnesses the first tripod an unearthly machine a hundred feet tall rise up beneath the street to begin moving on three spindly legs vaporizing everything in its path ray returns home like a 911 witness covered in ashes and hijacks the only vehicle not disabled by emp to get his kids back to their mom screenwriters josh friedman and david koepp secret window keep the basics from the hg wells novel narrator morgan freeman opens and closes with passages from the book but their introduction of the aliens is a major hiccup the implication being that aliens planted thousands of tripods a million years earlier why the wait many are sure to ask  one can deduce that a buildup in the human population was necessary but it is difficult to imagine that none of these underground machines would have been discovered in the interim they smartly twist a second onslaught heard but not seen in a homes basement into a human disaster yet spielberg presents the aftermath too pristinely with no sign of bodies where there should be he later has no such qualms when rachel witnesses the hudson river chockablock with the dead a very grim and effective loss of innocence the invasion though is really a backdrop to the ferrier story forced by extreme circumstances ray finds himself making most of the right choices and over the course of the film earns his kids trust after being clearly dismissed at the onset in one of the numerous references to 911 robbie is jazzed by the sight of the military wanting to fight back but rachel demands to know who will take care of her if he should leave ray is amazed by his eldests instincts when robbie assists strangers during a disastrous ferry crossing then faces his own kind of sophies choice moment when robbie begs to leave while rachel is being pulled away by misguided strangers after letting one child go ray goes to lengths he probably never dreamed of to protect his daughter and finds a fierce source of love in the bargain cruise takes his signature cockiness and this time around makes it a false front for a notsolikableguy he watches his very pregnant wife haul suitcases up his stairs who still exhibits shreds of decency that look suits you is the last thing he says to his obviously delighted ex he projects fearbased adrenaline to accomplish what he must and a softening sensitivity towards rachel little deuce coupe is sung in lieu of the lullabies he neglected to learn dakota fanning is mostly required to register either shock or fear and she accomplishes both believably just as chatwin is a credibly distant teen in the only other role of real significance tim robbins mystic river is saddled with the illdefined ogilvy who exists only as a test of rays character the aliens and their tripods have a look reminiscent of old cover illustrations of wells novel production design by rick carter jurassic park artificial intelligence ai combined with ferocious sound effects sound design and effects editing by michael babcock starsky  hutch that render them forbiddingly modern country encounters with the tripods have a retro set feel where hills lead up to a skyline hiding the monsters beyond think invaders from mars spielberg stages a terrific water tank sequence where a tripod rises to upset a crowded ferry the ferriers watch from the water as a car slides off the deck right at them plunging them underwater cinematography by janusz kaminski the terminal but many other sequences are redressed from earlier films most prominently jurassic parks raptor kitchen scene which is now an evasion of a tripods eye the eyes which haunted cruise in minority report return here not only on the tripods but in a duplicated shot through the hole of a broken windshield and rays constant blinding of rachel that vibrating rr sign from close encounters is an earlier simpler manifestation of electromagnetic pulse and ais flesh fair is echoed in the human cages of the tripods undercarriage the director goes too far pushing 911 images though we get the point early on as debris floats through the sky but a wall of the missings photos at a ferry landing makes little sense given the continuing chaos war of the worlds is a near perfect thrill ride but its creator throttles any suspension of disbelief right out of us with an all too perfect utterly nonsensical happy ending yet while his wars waging spielberg will have you by the throat ray ferrier tom cruise is a working class slob estranged from his family and too wrapped up in himself to have little more than a passing interest in son robbie justin chatwin and daughter rachel dakota fanning but his selfinvolvement will soon take a back seat when alien beings invade the earth and threaten to annihilate mankind in steven spielbergs making of the hg wells classic tale war of the worlds spielberg is a master craftsman in the art of film spectacle making and his vision of the hg wells story has all the visual elements one expects in a bigbudget scifi actioner unfortunately the decision was made somewhere along the line to draft sophomore scripter josh friedman chain reaction to adapt the terrific wells story the new telling starts off well enough to spark the viewers interest with the mysterious violent storms and meteors crashing into the earth as everyman ray tries to save his kids but mediocre writing especially the finale and shallow characters puts the wotw into the category of routine as ray frantically tries to save his kids the story meanders from one terrific action sequence to the next but the characters are not fully drawn cruise tries to delve into the anger fear and frustration of a man helpless to stop the relentless monsters out to kill him and his kids what we get is a man who seems to be more ticked off that his bowling night was cancelled than a man trying to survive there is little to laud about with the supporting cast of mostly unknowns besides cruise only dakota fanning and tim robbins have noticeable star power but neither gives or is allowed to give fully developed performances fanning a favorite of mine is left to look scared and scream at the appropriate moments but the director handles even this unevenly things storywise start to peter out at about the twothirds mark just in time to introduce ogilvy robbins a survivalist with a hankering to bring the war guerrillastyle to the aliens this extended scene takes elements from the 1953 version a firstrate cold war allegory starring gene barry and duplicates them almost exactly  with the benefit of over 50 years of fx development  but it bogs the whole movie down until the insipid happily ever after ending the special fx extravaganza is worth the price of admission from start to finish as the space invaders rear their armored heads and begin blasting mankind into oblivion there are a number of visual set pieces  the overhead highway being methodically blown to bits next to rays working class neighborhood an auto ferry that is too close when an alien death machine rises out of the hudson river the hopeless battle between the brave us army and the undefeatable robot monsters  that are eye candy of the finest kind one thing that real bothers me though with the new war of the worlds is the need to play foot loose and fancy free with science much is done to establish the power of the aliens when they unleash the cataclysmic electromagnetic pulse blasts that render everything electrical into uselessness then with thousands even millions of vehicles disabled by the emp ray steals a car that just so happens to have a new starter solenoid it doesnt seem to matter that any of the electrics in the car would be fried then later on the little family comes upon a town with fully functioning electricity but not one of the vehicles works this kind of cavalier treatment is unnecessary at this level of entertainment and impacted my suspension of disbelief im wondering if all the hype that has followed this film and mr cruises much publicized romance with halfhisage katie holme set expectations higher than they should have been having read the original hg wells story which has been a favorite of mine for many years may also raised my hopes higher than they probably should have been wotw is a beautifully crafted film with the fx money up there on the screen but suffers from a story that spirals down to its weak finale the sappy and silly happilyeverafter ending deserves a big boo
Jul 5 2005,positive,by far the biggest loudest and most elaborate adaptation of the hg wells classic
Jul 5 2005,positive,spielbergs list of great movies is too long to catalog here but rest assured war of the worlds now ranks among them
Jul 5 2005,negative,spielberg as hobbesian wells as eugenicist
Jul 5 2005,positive,how refreshing to see spielberg rock the boat with nothing more shocking than pure oldfashioned fear
